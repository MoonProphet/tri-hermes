## Class Skills  
  
**Magic Resistance: [A]**  
  
Cancels all A rank magic and below. As a matter of fact, modern magi are incapable of hurting Astolfo.  
By means of Astolfo's "book" Noble Phantasm, this Skill's rank has been largely elevated; normally, it would have been at D rank.  
  
**Riding: [A+]**  
  
The ability for riding. Capable of managing even beast with the rank of Phantasmal Beast and Divine Beast. However, this doesn't apply to dragon kin.  
  
**Independent Action: [B]**  
  
The ability to act independently for a period even if magic energy supply from the Master is severed.  
At B rank, even if he loses his Master he is able to stay manifested for a period of 2 days.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
**Evaporation of Reason: [D]**  
  
The loss of reason. Astolfo is incapable of keeping any and all secrets.  
Astolfo would blurt out allies' true name and weakpoint and forget important secrets; at this point, it's already a type of curse.  
This Skill also includes the effect of Instinct Skill, making it possible to grasp the most optimum course of action during combat.  
  
**Monstrous Strength: [C-]**  
  
Temporarily magnifies STR. However, during the usage of this Skill, Astolfo receives damage every turn.  
  
**Down with a Touch!: [D]**  
  
Trap of Argalia. Normally a Noble Phantasm. The jousting lance of the Knight Argalia. It possesses a golden spearhead.  
Although its capacity to wound is low, simply wounding the enemy would dematerialise their feet, turning it possible to make them fall down.  
To return themself from this fallen down state, a LCK check is necessary. Should it fail, the "fallen down" bad status would persist.  
However, each turn there is a LCK upwards adjustment, making the success rate easier.  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Hippogriff - Otherworldly Phantasmal Horse  
- Rank: B+  
- Type: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 2~50  
- Maximum target: 100 person  
  
Hippogriff.  
With the upper body of a griffin and the lower body of a horse, it is essentially an impossible existence of a Phantasmal Beast. Although its rank is lower compared to griffin, a beast from the age of the gods, its charging pulverization attack is equal to an A rank physical attack.  
  
However, this Phantasmal Horse's true value lays somewhere else.  
Drawing its origin as a halfling born from a griffin and a horse, its existence is extremely vague; and so it is able to put itself in the gap between dimensions, moving while permeating any and all sorts of attack.  
  
# La Black Luna - Magic Flute that Calls Panic  
- Rank: C  
- Type: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 1~50  
- Maximum target: 100 person  
  
La Black Luna.  
A hunting horn that emits a magical note reminiscent to the neigh of a sacred horse and the howl of a dragon. Those within its range would be struck with the shock of an explosive sound. In the case where the damage is the same or higher than the target HP, they will be turned to to dust and scattered around. It was given to Astolfo by the witch of beauty, Logistilla, and was used to drive away a flock of harpies. Normally it is reduced to a smaller size and hung on the hip, but upon usage it becomes big enough to even encircle Astolfo.  
In FateGO it is fundamentally not utilized.  
  
# Luna Break Manual - Universal Magic Guide  
- Rank: C  
- Type: Anti-Unit (Self) Noble Phantasm  
- Range: -  
- Maximum target: 1 person  
  
Luna Break Manual.  
Inherited from a certain witch, it is a book with the means to shatter any and all magic recorded within it. Just by possessing it makes it possible to automatically cancel magic A rank and below.  
It does not cancel a Reality Marble or a high-thaumaturgy exceedingly close to Reality Marbles to such an extent, but evoking its true name and reading its content makes it a possibility.  
...But Astolfo has completely forgotten the true name of this book. Even Universal Magic Guide is just a noncomittal name.  
The true name of this Noble Phantasm is "Destruction Declaration"-----Casseur de Logistille.  
(In FateGO it is fundamentally not utilized.)
