## Class Skills  
  
**Magical Resistance: [C]**  
  
Nullifies Magecraft spells that were done with a chant of two verses or below. Cannot defend against large-scale Magecraft such as Great Magecrafts and Ritual Spells.  
  
**Independent Action: [A]**  
  
One can act even with the absence of their Master. However, in a situation where one decides to use Noble Phantasms and the like that require an enormous amount of Magical Energy to consume, backup from their Master becomes necessary.  
  
**Divinity: [B]**  
  
Whether one has Divine Spirit aptitude or not. The higher the rank, the more they are treated as a mixed-race being of a physical Divine Spirit.  
  
Arjuna is the son of Thunder God Indra.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
**Clairvoyance: [C+]**  
  
Connotes the good quality of one’s visual acuity. It allows one to capture distant targets and improve their dynamic vision. Also, it is possible for one to acquire clairvoyant abilities.  
  
By extremely concentrating at the time of shooting his arrows from his bow, Arjuna can manipulate his own sense of time. He is certainly able to shoot what he is aiming at, all while at ease and without being flustered.  
  
**The Awarded Hero: [A]**  
  
The Great Hero Arjuna was born to be loved by everyone, and sometimes he would be given the necessary things he require from anyone. As long as he does not have an active cause like a curse, Arjuna will not lack in anything.  
  
**Magical Burst (Flame): [A]**  
  
A Skill granted to Arjuna by his Noble Phantasm “Agni Gandiva: The Roar of the Flame God”, which was handed over to him by Agni, the God of Flames. Jet propulsion by means of Magical Burst is utilized not for his body, but for the acceleration of his arrows. Arjuna’s arrows reach his enemies faster than a fired rifle bullet.  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Pashupata: The Aloft Hand of the Destruction God  
- Rank: A+  
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 1~100  
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1000 people  
  
A weapon granted to Arjuna by Shiva, one of the Three Greater Gods in Hinduism and the one who governs over destruction and creation in that religion. It is an Anti-“Personnel” Noble Phantasm, and that is from its nature of “not because it is exterminating the people in its surroundings all at once, but because it is conducting a check against the enemies within its range one by one, and it allows one to attain ’Moksha’ should they have failed their check.” Attaining Moksha, in other words, is instant death.  
  
The higher one’s Divinity is, the greater the probability it becomes for them attaining Moksha. On the contrary, Servants that are commonly called Anti-Heroes will result in their probability of attaining Moksha being lowered.  
  
# Agni Gandiva: The Roar of the Flame God  
- Rank: A  
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 1~50  
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person  
  
A bow of flames that essentially cannot be handled by humans (those with a predetermined period of life), awarded to Arjuna by the Flame God Agni. Although it is generally an ordinary bow, by invoking its True Name, it changes the arrows into missiles coiled around with flames. Although they are not homing missiles, because Arjuna is gifted in archery to begin with, they have a precision almost equivalent to a homing missile when further combined with his Clairvoyance Skill.  
  
  
# Character  
  
## Pronouns  
  
First Person Pronoun: watashi  
Second Person Pronouns: anata / anata [only to females] / kisama (to the likes of his opponents as well as Karna)  
Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo  
  
## Personality  
  
Extremely diligent, integrous, just and upright, Arjuna has a flawless personality with no faults to point out and hit on. The perfect person in the manner of a superman, he is on a standard where he is compelled to say “I have come” for the aid of others like a certain Knight of the Sun. He has no interest in wealth, whether the battle is an honourable one or not. And whether there is honour in battle or not, that however, is whether it was all in accordance with his sense of values (of which they are of the ancient Indian values) as a warrior.  
  
… However, when the opportunity has come, Arjuna will wonder and carry out all kinds of cowardly schemes. Although he is extremely hesitant in the preliminary stages, when he wonders if he can carry them out at that opportune time, he lets a wicked smile show. That must not be seen by anybody and everybody————suppose that, someone sees it. He warns himself then that he has no choice but to kill that person.  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
Fundamentally quiet, Arjuna follows his Master like a butler, and to most Masters, he would also not show the slightest bit of pride and the like even though he was actually of royalty. However, if his Master decides to take a grip to the point of attaining their Servant’s true nature like some common Masters for instance, there is a likelihood where Arjuna is even willing to kill his Master. “Trust” is not the only thing that can be gained by grasping the true nature of a partner. There is also a possibility of losing “trust” surely from “having grasped the true nature of a partner.” For example, even if his partner chooses to accept that darkness, the way Arjuna carries that dark side is all the more something he feels ashamed of in that case.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
“I was summoned as the Servant Archer. Treat me well please.”  
  
“It is not pleasant to worry about me. You and I… we should simply do what must be done. Is that good?”  
  
“My True Name is Arjuna. Similarly like the times of battle, I will show my Master the way to victory, even now.”  
  
“————You saw, my… smile?”  
  
## Historical Character and Figure  
  
If Karna is the “Hero of Charity”, Arjuna is indeed “The Awarded Hero”. He was born as the son of the King of Kuru, the third of the five Pandava brothers, and is also simultaneously the son of Indra.  
  
And his destined rival was Karna, his older brother from a different father. Arjuna – who was certainly a Hero where every aspect of him, from his calibre to his personality, has no faults to point out and hit on – was expelled from his country due to his older brother being defeated in a gamble. Already at this moment, he had a premonition inside him where there will be an inevitable confrontation with Karna. Because one can see that Karna looks up to Duryodhana – who scowls at the five Pandava brothers as his archenemies – as his father.  
  
Every time Arjuna thinks of Karna, he shudders as if it appears that he was seeing himself reflected in a mirror. And then, with that being plain to see————he became frightened; furthermore, the reflected expression is similar to one possibly seeing through everything about him completely.  
  
“In my heart… resides ‘Black (Krishna)’.”  
  
He loved his brothers, and was loved in return. He loved both his father and mother, and was loved in return. He loved the people, and was loved in return. And yet, Arjuna finds himself staring at some place with those eyes that had grown cold.  
  
How terrifying.  
  
“My darkness is terrifying. I differ from Karna. He, while cool-headed, is the warmth that believes in the people. I, while quiet, has a resignation that is so far as desperate.”  
  
Since when was it that Arjuna had resolved to kill Karna no matter what? Probably, it was from the moment they had faced each other in the beginning. That time, why did Arjuna not even remonstrate his brothers by expressing a single word to them when they were loudly speaking ill of Karna? Was it not because he envied Karna who displayed martial arts that actually surpasses his owns? What an ugly, petty emotion. This Arjuna must not harbour such a thing, for that is supposed to be the way he is. And thus, Karna must not notice that reason.  
  
“That discernment… if it exposes me————surely I, without a doubt, would die in shame. I regulated myself. Thoroughly, I continued to regulate, regulate, regulate. Consequently, the gods, my father, my mother, my wife, my brothers, they all loved Arjuna. If I am not loved, I am not even worth anything.”  
  
Karna fell out of his chariot by the hands of his charioteer, who was his betrayer. Arjuna pierced through Karna while the latter was struggling to budge the wheels of his chariot, and that is a deed that should not be done in the Way of the Warrior. Cowardly, and wretched, it is a conduct not even strange to others and really spoken ill of.  
  
However; opportunities… they should not be limited to being taken when it comes about a second time. And above all, Karna, who was nocking arrows to his bow————was smiling. Of course, that was not as a sneer to Arjuna. It was a smile of various emotions and reasons, but to Arjuna, it was not seen as that. At this moment, Arjuna abandoned being a warrior (Kshatriya) that held great joy in battle, but that became a mechanism with the purpose of finishing the war.  
  
Sure enough, Arjuna’s bow shot down the sun.  
  
Thus, the role of Arjuna also came to an end. Heroes behave as Heroes up to the end; they were Heroes up to the moment they died out. Brilliant heroic tales… they finished brilliantly up to the conclusion. Afterwards, Arjuna as a holy man who perceived everything is also still Arjuna, but his heart as a warrior was in a state of disorderly pieces.  
  
————“Sure enough, that one arrow shot down the sun.”  
————“Am I probably going to shoot it at him… once more?”  
  
## Standard Weapons  
  
**Gandiva**  
  
… The bow that Arjuna always uses. A bow granted to him by the Flame God Agni. It is also the bow that brought down Karna.  
  
## Related Characters  
  
**Karna**  
  
As already explained in accordance with the passage of his Historical Image and Character Image section. No doubt his destined rival.  
  
**Rama**  
  
The protagonist of the Ramayana. The manner of that refreshing boy is dazzling.  
  
“Though unpleasant, can you not touch on the subject regarding the matter of my wife? Because there were various circumstances too!”  
  
## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
Although I said that I’ll probably decide to draw Nobbu of the FGO World first for the time being, of these two characters, I ended up drawing this one first, and in some respects, he’s royalty performing like a butler. However, given that he’s a flawless child, he performs flawlessly regardless. Still, my recollection of him was designed with such an image.  
  
Despite the tips of the arrows not being sharp, because they have so much power behind them, there was something like an image where the arrows are cleanly gouging and removing something as they are from the targets, and watching him launch attacks with a wonderful sound within the game, I thought ‘Ah! Hey, it suits them; it’s fantastic.’ Truthfully, his hand during the moment of employing his Noble Phantasm is erotic, isn’t it? (pako)
