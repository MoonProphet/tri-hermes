## Class Skills  
  
**Independent Action: [EX]**  
  
A subspecies of possessed Servant. Mana is required to take action in combat, but regarding anything else, he can live for months and years just like an ordinary human.  
  
**Homunculus: [C+]**  
  
A homunculus cast by the Musik family having appropriated the skills of the Einzbern.  
Though accidental, he was born with a personality and excellent ability in magecraft.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
**Man-Made Hero (Fake): [B+]**  
  
A man-made pseudo-hero created by receiving the heart of the hero Siegfried and having Frankenstein’s Noble Phantasm electric current flowing inside his body. Though it’s only for a short time, by combining it with a Dragon Revelation Command Spell he can act as a hero ———— a Servant.  
  
**Magecraft: [C]**  
  
Natural talent that homunculi, cast from Magic Circuits, have.  
Makes use of a technique style that understands the structure of the target and destroys any solid material by striking with the completely opposite composition. However, Sieg can’t use any magecraft at all besides that.  
  
**Dragon Revelation Command Spells: [EX]**  
  
Dead Count Shapeshifter.  
By using the Command Spells he owns, he makes use of the inserted heart of Siegfried although temporarily, and can transform into Siegfried.  
A super-unique skill that is impossible to be possessed by others that aren’t the homunculus Sieg.  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Scorching dragon breath · Liquefaction of all the land: Ákafiloga Allgríðr  
- Rank: EX  
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm (Self)  
- Range: 0  
- Maximum number of targets: 1 (the breath has a range of approximately 50)  
  
Ákafiloga Allgríðr.[1]  
A Noble Phantasm that brings a temporary figure transformation into the Dragn Kind “Fafnir”.  
By emitting a powerful Breath of the Dragon (dragon breath), it deals immense damage.  
Fundamentally he returns to normal once he finishes breathing, but if it’s for a short time things such as flight in the shape of a dragon are possible too.  
  
# Character  
  
## Pronouns  
  
First person pronoun: 俺 (ore)  
Second person pronoun: あなた (anata) / 君 (kimi)  
Third person pronoun: 彼 (kare) / 彼女 (kanojo)  
  
## Personality  
  
Due to the method of birth (manufacture), he was only given innocent emotions like those of a baby, but based on the abundant knowledge he was blessed with by birth, he was formed as one living being in one way or another.  
He, who was motivated by one of the main objectives of living beings that is 『to survive』, gains humanity by encountering several incidents.  
That was in a certain sense, an attempt to make a being that was a lifeform from a higher order be degraded into something vulgar.  
Eventually he harbored anger unnecessary for a living being due to the death of a Holy Maiden, and contended for the decisive battle.  
His current state was copied in a state close to the final stage, expresses emotions as it is, and shows a glimpse of a side brimming with curiosity.  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
Serving a common Master, or being summoned is rare, so there is no problem in thinking that his attitude regarding the Master is just like his attitude towards the protagonist.  
He respects the Master that is fighting to protect Human Order, and will fight risking his life for his/her sake.  
He, who was destined from the beginning to disappear once everything is over, doesn’t have a bit of hesitation in his disappearance.  
If he was to hesitate, it would just be a separation from a partner who he deepened his bonds with.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
「Servant… Sieg. I apologize, I’m just a homunculus.  
I think you can’t expect much of me as military strength, but it seems that if it’s with my registered Noble Phantasm I can somehow fight. Use me as you deem fit.」  
  
「Transformation start.  
My body is the evil dragon that flies embracing the Chalice of Heaven.  
Melt everything… Ákafiloga Allgríðr!」  
  
「… Master. Er, it would make me happy if you became my friend.  
I don’t know if this is a way to invite you or not but  
… No, forget it.  
It’s awkward」  
  
## Character in FGO  
  
What if someone extended their hand towards an unreachable star while gritting their teeth.  
He was in the side that shot down that star.  
He is just a homunculus, just a human.  
Formerly a homunculus of the Musik family ———— He who was cast for the use of mana supply, was chosen by Avicebron as a candidate for the nucleus of his Noble Phantasm, but he escaped in fear of that fact.  
After many twists and turns, the homunculus that went by the name of Sieg obtained the omnipotent wish-granting device, and flew away to the Reverse Side of the World in the form of Fafnir.  
……Now, the Sieg summoned in Chaldea is a terminal distributed from there.  
The main body has almost the same thoughts and performance, but only the accumulated experience is different.  
That said, that’s a life allowed only in the circumstances in which Human Order is trembling.  
While finding out the meaning of living a different life from the main body separated far away, he will someday disappear as if he was dreaming.

**Jeanne Darc**  
  
I see. Ruler being here is a natural logic.  
It’s not like she will remember me, but I can’t help but carelessly call out to her.  
  
**Jeanne Darc (Alter)**  
  
Another aspect of that Ruler…?  
It’s hard to believe, but there are many things with this situation.  
And the outside may be different, but her being too serious at the core feels like Ruler.  
No, the class is Avenger, though.  
  
**Servants that participated in the Great Holy Grail War**  
  
Everyone is a splendid hero.  
Though only a little, I’m proud of having been able to fight.  
  
**Astolfo**  
  
Rider is Rider anywhere.  
Um, I’m glad.  
  
**Sitonai**  
  
Summarizing you’re a homunculus, Sitonai, Freyja, and Louhi.  
I see, how complicated.  
…Me too in general?  
I’m a homunculus, temporarily borrow Siegfried’s power, can transform into Fafnir,  
and I’m a fragment of a former Master?  
…How complicated…

## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
He was already perfected in Apocrypha, so there isn’t any material worth speaking about because it’s FGO, I’m sorry… Such a scrap mountain of memories I dug out! I carelessly didn’t acknowledge him as a welfare character, so I ended up making a design rough even for the third stage like crazy! He was so cool! CERTAINLY SMILING LIKE AN ANGEL!!! Anyway, a character you can obtain by playing is a good thing in its way. Gacha is bad civ… (The description is broken off here)[2] (Ototsugu Konoe)  
  
## TL Notes  
  
[1]:In Old Norse, Ákafi = heat/vehemence, Loga = blaze, Allr = all, Gríðr = greed. The translation would be "Blazing All-Greed". Thanks to u/ComunCoutinho for providing this translation.  
[2]: This is actually written there. Rip Konoe, probably Photon Ray'd for stealing catchphrases.
