## Class Skills  
  
**Territory Creation: [A]**

That ability of his that had created the Temple of Jerusalem is of the highest peak of Territory Creation.  
  
**High Speed Incantation: [C]**  
  
The ability to hasten magic incantation speed.  
Despite being fast, his tendency to worry prones to ruin it and sometimes makes him do a mistake.  
  
**Tool Creation: [C]**  
  
Creation of tools tinged with magic energy.  
Perhaps because he is specialized in contracts, his Tool Creation ability is on average level.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
**Evocation: [EX]**  
  
Magic that evokes of spiritual bodies of the past, or perhaps the future.  
With his Evocation ability that spoke of the summoned spiritual existences, the "Seventy Two Demon Gods", and established them as capable familiars, he truly lived up to his title of King of Magic.  
  
**Revelation: [B]**  
  
A Skill that hears of "the voice from the Heavens" and performs the most suitable of actions.  
While "Instinct" is a sixth sense for combat purpose, Revelation conforms to all matters in regards of achieving a goal (such as selecting the most suitable road for travel route).  
Solomon had only ever received one Revelation, but based on that he had established the phenomena operation technique--that is, magic--that even an ordinary person could perform. (Until then, magic had been a work only for those related to the gods.)  
  
**Rings of Solomon: [EX]**  
  
The ten rings given by God. The mark of the king, the progenitor of magic.  
In the case of all ten rings present, any and all kinds of magic performed by mankind is invalidated and put under his subordination.  
  
**Clairvoyance: [EX]**  
  
Eyesight of good quality. Apprehension of long distance target and elevation of kinetic vision. When the rank is high enough, even x-ray vision or future prediction becomes possible.  
Solomon's Clairvoyance gives him unobstructed view of both the past and the future.  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Ars Nova - The Time of Parting has Come, He is the One who Lets Go of the World  
- Rank: D  
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm  
- Range: -  
- Maximum target: 1 person  
  
Ars Nova.  
The First Noble Phantasm. A Noble Phantasm that belongs not to Goetia, but to the true King Solomon (Dr. Roman).  
The exploits that he had fulfilled until now, the miracles that he had accomplished until now, the magic that he had achieved until now; it is a poem of parting that lets go of it all.  
Upon the invocation of this Noble Phantasm, Solomon returns back to the heavens the graces that he had received from God, losing his eye that gazes at the world.  
The result is the death of King Solomon. And conversely, the disintegration of the 72 demon gods.  
It can be said to be the safety device that Solomon had prepared for the sake of destroying "magic", should the time in a distant future comes when it becomes an evil for human.  
...When this Noble Phantasm is employed, Solomon would vanish from even the Throne of Heroes.  
  
Solomon's complete evanescence implies not of erasure of all traces of Solomon, but rather that that everything that he must do now had been completed.  
...Each and every living existences have things they had left undone as their time is concluded and ended. No matter how flawless they had live their life, they would always leave behind a "remnant".  
Those "remnants" will then be carried over by the people that will continue even further, bringing to forth the path of human history.  
  
A complete evanescence means an ascenscion from this very path.  
To accomplish every task one is granted with, a state of existence where one no longer has any matter undone.  
  
There is no longer any need to defeat him, nor the need to rely on him.  
No longer will anyone ask of him,  
no longer will anyone bear the burden of his death,  
no longer will anyone ask for his help, for his accomplishment.  
  
That is what it means to disappear even from the Throne of Heroes.  
To be released from the duty of life, to have completed all the task one is burdened with in this universe.  
The messiah is the sole being among the mankind to have attained enlightenment, but the coward had attained and arrived on a "destination" of a different bearing.  
  
# Character  
  
## Pronouns  
  
First pronoun: watashi/boku (as Solomon)  
Second pronoun: kimi  
Third pronoun: kimitachi/shokun  
  
## Personality  
  
Introvert, self-assured, passive.  
A gentle king that gives off a relaxed sense.  
"Confidence" is his main characteristic, but it's actually only his ability of "unable to read the mood." As a result, he only makes statements in a confident manner, but is actually a coward (chicken) in his basic nature.  
Diligent but not earnest, he lives by putting only 80% of his maximum effort.  
He poperly ascertained of the people, properly established the law, and properly governed the country.  
Although he is somewhat lacking in mettle, he is a wise and kind king full of love, respected and beloved by his people.  
However, all of those traits are not actually by Solomon's own will.  
From his birth, he had been ordained to be a king, to hear the voice of God and to live in accordance to it. There is no emotion within him; he is inhuman, deprived of the autonomy to symphatize with the joy and sorrow of the people.  
  
Only when he becomes Romani Archaman that he finally acquires his original human nature.  
His root is that of a pessimist and realist. Even though he speaks of wishful thinking as a moodmaker, due to himself unable to think of that as more than pipe dreams, he is quite shameless in some respects.  
He loves humans, but because he's a coward in nature who "does not want to see sad things", he ends up limiting himself with superficial relationships. On the other hand, he is capable of being good terms with pretty much everybody. Your typical affable friendly guy.  
When being faced with a dilemma, he has the bad habit of choosing to stay undecided and devoting himself to just observe, or just straight up runs away, so that the status quo is maintained.  
Due to Roman himself is reflecting on that weakness of his, it only needs a few words, for someone in his surroundings to simply says "hang in there", for him to somehow holds his ground and displays a resolution worthy of the King of Magic.  
  
Incidentally, any Servants would end up having "I don't know the reason but this guy's the one at fault here" as their first impression for Roman; and due to that they will unconsciously complain about him.  
The only ones who don't judge him negatively are those who aren't Servants, the contrarians, and the Berserkers that don't perceive evil as evil.  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
He conceals the fact that he had been Solomon, collaborating with the protagonist as a human.  
The first Heroic Spirit that Chaldea summoned. (Summoning Case No. 1)  
He had had the premonition of the arrival of humankind's extinction, unknown in its nature, and had been hiding himself in Chaldea as a researcher.  
The reason that he keeps his true colors hidden is because he is wary against the mastermind behind the incineration of human history, and at the same time due to him feeling responsible out of fear that somehow, he is the one to blame for this.  
While he does think that it is unjustifiable to the protagonist, he himself is completely unapologetic about it.  
"I mean, there's just no helping it. You can hate me all you want, I don't mind. Actually, it would only be natural if you do. To begin with, I'm just not someone worthy for other people to like."  
Due to him undervaluing (self-torturing) himself like that, he thinks that it's only natural for people to detest him rather than like him.  
  
<>  
  
Winner of the Holy Grail War of the year 2004.  
His wish upon the Grail is "to live as a human".  
In the midst of the Holy Grail War, Solomon thought of this.  
"Romance. Romance, is it! Such a pleasant word. A fresh concept, one yet to exist during my time."  
A phrase that had yet to exist in his age.  
A way of life where a single human freely embraces their dream.  
For such a world that displays such a thing to exist.  
It was because he felt, from the bottom of his heart, that it is such a magnificent thing, that Solomon decided to call himself "Roman".  
And after the Holy Grail War had concluded.  
Receiving the name Romani Archaman, Roman then set out to begin his second life. Alas, he was unable to experience the fullness, the joy of being human that he had not acquire during his live.  
For his freedom had been snatched away when he was shown a glimpse of the future, of the end of mankind, just as he had been made human.  
Ever since then, just like an infant newly born to the world, he had to chase an enemy whose true nature he knew not of in reselessness, embarking on a lone man's struggle.  
As he, in desperation, chased after knowledge, acquired technology, and ran as if weeping in the darkness, he made it in time for the fated moment (the 2015 rayshift experiment.)  
  
During the final stage of the first part, Roman is struck with an inner conflict when he had fathomed that Goetia was the mastermind.  
He has a way of defeating Goetia.  
If he could reach the Time Temple, confront Goetia before he is aware of the existence of the "last ring", and make use of Solomon's first Noble Phantasm, then he could make Goetia lost his invincibility.  
But at the same time, it would mean his own obliteration.  
The previous Solomon would just say "That, too, is fine, I suppose" and would simply be done with it. But the previous Solomon is not the current Solomon.  
He is Dr. Roman now.  
The king who had tasted his second life, who had been made known of the magnificence of life, is in anguish.  
To resolve himself for death.  
Could he overcome that fear, that remorse?  
  
## Historical Character and Figure  
  
A figure who lived between BC 1000 to BC 931. The third king of ancient Israel.  
The great king who had brought about grand prosperity to ancient Israel. He was the man who employed 72 demon gods and had built the first temple of Israel.  
  
His policy as a king was excelling, but other than that he also had numerous anecdote as a magus.  
Solomon had once married an Egyptian female pharaoh, but after that, God appeared in his dream and said to him: "You are worthy. Tell me of what you desire. Ask, and I shall give it to you."  
Solomon desired not of gold or power; above all that, above anything, he wished for wisdom.  
God was content with his answer, for Solomon's very answer was a sign that he possessed the qualifications to reach "true wisdom".  
Solomon's eye was then awakened, and he was granted ten rings on both of his hands.  
It was the very mark of the wise man approved by God. Later on it would be known as the Rings of Solomon, the origin of the magic that employs both angels and demons.  
  
Even though King Solomon had accomplished that miracle only once, it is the one that reveals his wisdom. It was then made known to the people that "the king had been granted the protection of God's own"; once was more than enough.  
For anymore miracle would struck fear to the people and degrade it.  
Solomon's name as the Magic King was spread to the neighboring countries, all the while without using magic itself, and he left this world all the while known as the wise king.  
  
## Character in FGO  
  
The character that acts as the navigator for the protagonist throughout the seven chapters.  
In the last chapter, after he had seen Mash's last moment with his own eyes, the coward then told to himself of the end, and deployed the first Noble Phantasm.  
He severed Goetia's strength, then vanished after entrusting what comes after to the protagonist.  
  
## Related Characters  
  
**David**  
  
His father. And yet, David and Solomon has a relatively indiferent parent-child relationship.  
Even if Solomon declares that he would incinerate humankind, David would say "Mm, Solomon does say things like that" and just coolly observe.  
It is the same with Solomon; even if David declares that Solomon is a failure of a human being, Solomon would say "Well, Father does say things like that" and call if off just like that.  
  
**Cleopatra, Ozymandias**  
  
Solomon was very fond of the Egyptian beauty, but didn't care much for the pharaoh.  
  
**Galahad**  
  
The same with him, someone who was granted by God "the chance to have his prayer fulfilled".  
Solomon had wished for wisdom, but Galahad had wished for nothing.  
Solomon questions "Why?" in regards of that matter, and bears a sense of inferiority that comes from his subconscious regret, thinking that "I should have done so."  
  
**Goetia**  
  
With all said and done, you, aren't you hating me a bit too much?!
