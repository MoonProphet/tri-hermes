## Class Skills  
  
**Magical Resistance: [A]**  
  
By the teachings he received from a sacred sage, all magic was rejected from Rama. Cancels out all Magecraft spells that are at the Ranks of A and below. In fact, modern mages would not be able to wound Rama with their Magecraft.  
  
**Riding: [A+]**  
  
The ability for riding. In the case of beasts, one can manage any kind of them up to the rank of Phantasmal Beast and Divine Beast. However, this Skill is not applicable to members of the Dragon Kind.  
  
**Divinity: [A]**  
  
Rama, the Saint Hero who surpasses many heroes, is one of the avatars of Vishnu, one of the Three Greater Gods of India.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
**Blessing of Martial Arts: [A]**  
  
Rama, whose fate is to defeat Demon King Ravana, not only excels in swordsmanship, but also with all forms of martial arts. Also, due to this, he can bring out his prided spear and bow with powers close to a Noble Phantasm while as a Saber.  
  
**Charisma: [B]**  
  
The natural talent to command an army. Increases the abilities of allies during group battles. A rare talent, it is possible to say that having Rank B in this is sufficient for one to lead a whole country as its monarch.  
  
After the battle with Ravana and his triumphal return with Sita, Rama became a king who widely imposed his virtuous rulership, having devoted his life to protecting his country.  
  
**Curse of Separation: [A]**  
  
A curse that was put on Rama by the wife of a monkey with the name of Vali, all due to an incident where Vali was killed by Rama. Because of this, Rama cannot ever meet with his wife Sita – who can even possibly be said to be his other half – for all of eternity.  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Brahmastra: The Indestructible which Pierces Through Rakshasas  
- Rank: A+  
- Classification: Anti-Demon Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 1~10  
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person  
  
The “Indestructible Blade” brought alongside Rama himself from the moment he was born for the sake of bringing down Demon King Ravana. It boasts a tremendous power against any demonic being. Originally an arrow – something to be nocked onto a bow and shot with – Rama, who wanted to become a Saber, forcibly remodelled it into a sword. However, its ability as a thrown weapon has not been discarded, and this sword can be violently thrown too. One should not point out “So you can throw it after all?”  
  
# Vishnu Baja: The Arms of the Great One  
- Rank: A  
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 1~50 (varies by weapon)  
- Maximum Number of Targets: 500 people  
  
The numerous weapons granted by the sage Vishwamitra for opposing all kinds of gods and demons. Several of the overwhelming number of weapons include:  
  
- Discs (chakrams), which are throwing weapons  
- The javelin Shuuravara  
- The clubs (gada) Modhaki and Shikhari  
- The trident possessed by the god Shiva, Trisula  
- Shiva’s bow, Pinaka  
  
… and so forth. The higher Rama’s Divinity, the more his existence is regarded as something close to Vishnu’s, and the maximum limit of the number of the many weapons he can bring out grows. If his Divinity is at Rank A, then it is also not impossible for him to operate as an Archer and a Lancer while being a Saber.

## Pronouns  
  
First Person Pronoun: yo  
Second Person Pronouns: omae / kisama / nanji, etc.  
Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo  
  
## Personality  
  
Although he has a somewhat haughty section for his personality, Rama is basically a young boy who keeps up his efforts daily and is probably a splendid being as a “Great King”. He is gentle to his subordinates and animals, further doing things such as curing squirrels with healing spells and helping others in making a bridge.  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
Regarding his Master, Rama will consider them as “a person who joined forces with him.” Naturally, he will not allow his Master to treat him as someone of a lower rank, but he will put his trust in them as a brethren to the very end.  
  
Regarding the Holy Grail, Rama’s wish is “to undo his Curse of Separation from his wife Sita”, but up to the present time, that wish has not yet been granted.  
  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
“Servant, Saber. I am Rama, the Great King of Kosala. Now that I have been summoned, I will certainly defeat any enemy, no matter how formidable they are, and I will give victory to you.”  
  
“I understand, it is my loss… Surely, I… am like a child, you know… Yeah, so guide me. If it is the Master’s words, I will have faith in them and risk my life… Let us go!”  
  
“If you are here, I… would be fine with that alone…!”  
  
## Historical Character and Figure  
  
The protagonist of the “Ramayana”, one of the two major epic poems in India.  
  
Ravana, who could enslave even the gods due to a power he acquired by deceiving a great god, was a Demon King famed for the fact that only humans had the qualifications to defeat him.  
  
Granting the appeals of the gods, Vishnu reincarnated as Rama, born as the imperial prince of a certain country – an ordinary human who had forgotten about everything.  
  
Rama was naturally wise, but he was expelled from his country due to a scheme; borrowing and receiving powers from the sages and the gods, Rama tried to take back Sita, his beloved Queen, from the hands of Demon King Ravana.  
  
But even someone unique such as Rama had committed a fatal blunder. Intervening into a fight between fellow monkeys to rescue his ally monkey, Sugriva, he performed a sneak attack on the enemy monkey, Vali. Unable to forgive that, Vali’s wife placed a curse on him.  
  
“Even if you are able to take back your Queen, you will never share joy together with her again.”  
  
That curse still continues on even after Rama defeated Ravana and rescued Sita. It has been arranged so that Rama, the reincarnation of the god Vishnu, will continue to pass by Sita, his beloved Queen, for all his life. The day the two can cuddle close together is when they must take back their original forms and ascend to the heavens.  
  
But on the other hand, that also meant eternal separation from Sita until then. Though she was recaptured from the hands of Ravana that one time, it has been decided that Sita would leave Rama’s side during that moment as the nation’s people voiced suspicions of her being unfaithful to him.  
  
Simultaneously; when Rama is being summoned, it has been decided so that the circumstances of this curse, at the time of being summoned by the Holy Grail, will have “Sita” be summoned instead as a different side of Rama. That is to say, it is also a sign that even being summoned due to the Holy Grail will not be able to make the two stand side-by-side.  
  
Rama is primarily not a Saber, and it would be more proper to summon him as an Archer. As far as he is concerned, it is because Brahmastra is an arrow that eliminates all things demonic. However, an exemplary anecdote that has to do with Sita is her bow (her Noble Phantasm is “Haradhanu Janaka: Reminiscing the Peerless Bow”), so considering the likelihood that she would be summoned, Sita could not be a Saber; thus, Rama takes that Class instead so that Sita can get the Class of Archer.  
  
… But then, since the Saber Class happens to be famed as the most superior of all the Classes, it may not be known that it was inevitable for Rama to choose this Class because being a young boy, he would try to put on a show for Sita.

## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
**Rama**  
  
Rama’s concept is like the western movie trailer: “The world’s number one for three consecutive years by being an androgynous pretty boy. For you, the finest good-looking guy one can think about right now!“ (There is no such western movie though). Drawing a shy expression, I thought, ’You’re super cute I tell you!’ In spite of him being a great king, I see that the contents of his character is like a great princess character when I was playing the game, so with that being the case, that does hit a moe point too, don’t you think? (Rin Kususaga)  
  
**Sita**  
  
Hey, this young woman wears just about no clothes on her! Please report her! Still, the concept for Sita is a girl with twintails, but in the beginning, I misunderstood it as ’Rama transforms and becomes this young woman!’ as the concept (what are you saying!), and because I was misunderstanding, I thought, ’Changing into those clothes and underwear whenever he transforms… He’s TOTALLY a pervert I tell you…’ I was relieved that he’s very much a different person. I’m thinking, ’Personally, because of this super satisfying design, I can’t draw any more of these characters for another ten years you know!’… And it’s also something called like… ’It looks like I stopped continuing my work for the next ten years (shudders).’ (Rin Kususaga)
