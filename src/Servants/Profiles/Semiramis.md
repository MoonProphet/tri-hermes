## Class Skills  
  
**Presence Concealment: [C+]**  
  
Suppresses one’s presence as a Servant. It is suitable for espionage activities.  
  
The rank of Presence Concealment drops greatly when Semiramis is preparing to attack. However, this demerit is not included in cases where she is concealing poison as preparations for attack.  
  
**Territory Creation: [EX]**  
  
As a mage, one can create an advantageous position for themselves.  
  
By collecting specific materials, it is possible for Semiramis to construct a “Hanging Gardens”, which is superior to a “Temple”.  
  
**Tool Creation: [C]**  
  
One can create devices tinged with Magical Energy.  
  
Semiramis specializes in tools that use poison, but she cannot create any devices other than those.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
**Familiar (Dove): [D]**  
  
One can employ doves as their familiars.  
  
A contract is not necessary for Semiramis to use doves as her familiars, and it is not a problem for her to dispatch them with her thoughts alone.  
  
**Double Summon: [B]**  
  
A rare trait that only a small portion of Servants have.  
  
Semiramis can materialize with and possess the Class Skills of both the Assassin and Caster Classes.  
  
**Divinity: [C]**  
  
Semiramis is the daughter of Derketo – the Syrian Fish Goddess – and a mortal.  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Hanging Gardens of Babylon: The Aerial Gardens of Vainglory  
- Rank: EX  
- Classification: Anti-World Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 10~100  
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1000 people  
  
The Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Semiramis was actually not involved with the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. However, this was established as one of her Noble Phantasms by using the faith of the many people that misunderstood it as so.  
  
Because this is a “vainglory” after all, the Noble Phantasm’s invocation conditions are strict. By transporting a fixed amount of earth and stone from historic ruins in the vicinity of Baghdad – the capital city of Iraq – and putting those together, the invocation arrangements can then be finally completed. (The number of days needed to invoke it are about three days at the very least.)  
  
It literally manifests as “a great fortress that floats in mid-air”. And as long as Semiramis is inside the fortress, all of her Stats are Ranked-Up. Her fame also rises to the highest class, and furthermore, plus modifiers are added to her attacks when she is attacking.  
  
# Šikaru Ušum: Intoxicating Alcohol of the Arrogant Ruler  
- Rank: B+  
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 1~20  
- Maximum Number of Targets: 10 people  
  
Šikaru Ušum (Intoxicating Drink of the Dragon)[1]. An environmental property of “Poison” is bestowed to the atmosphere around Semiramis and to her Magecraft. It is a Noble Phantasm that can only be invoked in the Throne Room of the Aerial Gardens of Vainglory.  
  
Against Servants who possess anecdotes of “poison was not effective against them”, they are granted a Debuff Resistance towards poison. But then, in cases where they have episodes where they have suffered from being poisoned, this Noble Phantasm doubles the poison damage. It is feasible for Semiramis to select the type of poison used, and she can also freely make it lethal or non-lethal as she pleases. Furthermore, it is also feasible for her to summon even Mystical Beasts that possess poison.  
  
# Character  
  
## Pronouns  
  
- First Person Pronoun: ware  
- Second Person Pronouns: nanji / kisama  
- Third Person Pronouns: ayatsu, etc.  
  
## Personality  
  
An empress overflowing with cunning and ambition. Whether enemy or ally, Semiramis will kick and bring them down, kill them by having them drink poison, and even break their hearts by having them drink poison too.  
  
The suspicion Semiramis harbours toward others is strong, and whether it is necessary or not, she will dispose of even her allies. At the same time, she also has absolute confidence in her own power (but so long as she is within her territory).  
  
Because of that, Semiramis’ compatibility with other monarchs is fatally bad, and it is rare for her to take the initiative herself.  
  
In cases where she established “The Aerial Gardens of Vainglory” in its complete form, Semiramis will exceptionally go on the attack aggressively for she boasts matchless strength while within the Gardens’ interior.  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
Semiramis fundamentally understands that it is a situation of use and be used. Her Master cannot be careless in any way, but if they associate themselves with her honestly, she may open her heart to them. Or maybe, she will use them as her puppet. At any rate, if one is not much of a Master, then Semiramis is an untrustworthy companion to them.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
- “Servant, Assassin. I am Semiramis. Now… First of all, prepare a throne for me. We can talk after that. If thou hast none, then it cannot be helped, but ’tis fine if thou become my chair.”  
- “I will show you a citadel of the skies that no man can touch. The Gardens of Vainglory – Hanging Gardens of Babylon. It is fine if you crawl around like ants… Fufu, hahahahaha!”  
- “’Ere thou is a cup of poison. Drink up… ’Tis a joke. But… that is perhaps the way love is. Be cautious and live, my Master.”  
  
## Historical Character and Figure  
  
The legendary Empress who reigned over the Assyrian Empire. Semiramis was born between the Goddess Dekerto and Oannes, a mortal. It has been told that Semiramis had been abandoned by Derketo when she was a baby, but doves bundled around her in order to warm her up – perhaps because half of her was divine – and they reared her up until she was taken into the care of a shepherd at the age of 10. Afterwards, she was married to Onnes, a veteran army general, but she was forcibly snatched away from Onnes by King Ninus, who was charmed by her beauty. Semiramis made many suggestions to King Ninus, and although she deepened his favour in her, she killed King Ninus via poison several days after she became Queen Consort————  
  
It has also been told that at the end of her reign, Semiramis was either murdered by her son or that she was given an oracle that the imperial throne would be inherited by her son, so she transformed her appearance into a dove and took off to the skies.  
  
In addition, the Hanging Gardens was originally not Semiramis’ work. Therefore, the word “Vainglory” is engraved into the Noble Phantasm’s name.  
  
## Character in FGO  
  
Although Semiramis has a desire to rule, it is also not a particularly strong desire. From the way it seems this time, she will totally cooperate as a Servant, for she also has a proper wish called the Human Order Correction. Nonetheless, given that it is a rare summon for her, she does not conceal her desire in wanting to toy with others according to her own whims.  
  
## Standard Weapons  
  
Chains and the like from her wedge-shaped magic circles. Semiramis can also summon Mystical Beasts.  
  
## Related Characters  
  
**Amakusa Shirou Tokisada**  
  
The Master Semiramis fought together with in a certain Holy Grail War. Nonetheless, it seems that she has a thought where it is simply another her who was summoned in a different world, so this Semiramis precisely attaches that distinction… or, she should attach it, but…  
  
**Other Monarch Servants**  
  
Semiramis is terribly disrespectful to every last one of them. If it comes to it, she has no choice but to give them a drink.  
  
**Atalanta**  
  
If only Atalanta’s wish came true, or if only Semiramis was by her side.  
When she was born, Semiramis dreamed of an uninteresting future such as “Say, I dost not want to hast these painful feelings” and bitterly smiled a little.  
  
**Mordred**  
  
Semiramis’ compatibility with Mordred is so far as fatally bad. Far and away the number 1 Servant she does not want to face in Chaldea.  
  
## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
I’m going cr-cr-crazy over her! “So, the real story behind Ms. Semiramis. I have a friend whose strong point is in doing up hair, so it seems that they were absorbed in arranging Semiramis’ hair. If one takes a closer look at her hair ornaments, the eggs will hatch, and they will grow into elegant doves…! Speaking of which, rumour has it that the doves who spoke ill of her behind her back – saying she was dressing herself up to look young – had left behind a note saying “Please do not search for me” and disappeared.” (Konoe Ototsugu)  
  
## TL Notes:  
  
[1] – Šikaru Ušum had its Noble Phantasm abilities depicted in the Skills section, but I don’t like that style for the Fate/Grand Order materials, so I moved it over to the Noble Phantasm section and added in its Classification, Range and Maximum Number of Targets from Semiramis’ Fate/Apocrypha profile.
