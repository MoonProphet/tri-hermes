## Class Skills  
  
**Magic Resistance: [B]**  
  
Invalidates anything regarding invocation of magecraft with a chant of three verses or lower.  
Even with High-Thaumaturgy/Greater Rituals, wounding him is difficult.  
  
**Independent Action: [A]**  
  
Can act even in absence of a Master.  
However, in the case of requiring vast amounts of mana such as for the usage of his Noble Phantasm, back-up from his Master is necessary.  
  
**Divinity: [C]**  
  
A being born from the union between the god of the earth and a fairy, but in order to make his body decline into that of a human just before his death, it is reduced in a large scale.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
**Eye of the Mind (True): [A]**  
  
Insight cultivated through discipline/training.  
A “battle logic” through which the own state and the enemy’s ability is grasped even in a predicament, and the remaining means to escape are deduced on the spot.  
  
**Consecration of Eternal Life: [EX]**  
  
The anecdote of him being elevated as Sagittarius by offering his immortality turned into a skill.  
Due to Chiron being converted into stars as Sagittarius, he bears the duty of protecting people from the celestial scorpion.[1]  
  
**Wisdom of Divine Gift: [A+]**  
  
Various types of knowledge as a sage given from the gods of Greek mythology.  
Excepting those distinctive of heroes, almost all skills can be exhibited with a proficiency of B~A rank.  
Also, it’s possible to grant skills to other Servants with consent from the Master.

## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Antares Snipe - Shooting at the Celestial Scorpion  
- Rank: A  
- Type: Anti-Unit  
- Range: 5~99  
- Maximum number of targets: 1 person  
  
Antares[3] Snipe.  
The embodiment of the episode in which Chiron, turned into Sagittarius, is always aiming at the celestial scorpion.  
The ultimate strike a bowman can reach, piercing the stars.  
A meteoric strike that can be launched at the point the True Name is released, and that is fired not from his bow, but from the stars.  
Even Achilles, renowned for being a fast runner, couldn’t dodge this Noble Phantasm.  
There is the demerit of only being usable once a night, but it won’t miss the target unless the timing is wrong.

## Pronouns  
  
First person pronoun: 私 (watashi)  
Second person pronoun: 貴方 (anata) / 貴女 (anata)  
Third person pronoun: 彼 など (kare and similar)  
  
## Personality  
  
A gentle intellectual.  
Level and calm, although he as human emotions, since he is an educator, he fundamentally doesn’t deem acceptable letting the negative emotions come to the surface.  
  
It is said that he makes the presence of a quiet forest waft, but that’s an indication of his gentle attitude.  
  
The Centaurs he belongs to are generally treated as a violent and irrational barbarian tribe, but Chiron is an exception and he was treated in Greece as a wise man.  
  
If it had to be explained in a few words, 『a teacher by nature』.  
That is no exception even after having become a Servant.  
  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
He fundamentally behaves reverently like a butler, but if the Master is immature (and if they request his teachings), he’ll gladly instruct them.  
  
However, Chiron, who is aware that he is a guest, always gives guidance to his Master while considering what will happen after he leaves.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
「I see. If this is a Holy Grail War even though provisional,  
this possibility wasn’t unlikely.  
…Destiny sometimes bares its fangs even to us the dead」  
  
  
「No, there’s only one thing that I want to tell you. You are wonderful.  
No matter what kind of hardship you find in your life hereafter,  
you will be able to walk facing forwards without being disheartened.  
I’m convinced that you’re that kind of pupil」  
  
  
「Has my star pierced the spot that it had to pierce?  
…… At the end of the end, it seems I finally managed to fulfill my duty as a Servant」  
  
  
## Historical Character and Figure  
  
The great wise man in Greek mythology.  
Because of him being well versed in all sorts of knowledge and the dexterity of his way of teaching there are countless heroes in Greece who received his teachings.  
Heracles, Achilles, Jason, Asclepios, Castor… Though the periods are different, they all are pupils of Chiron.  
  
Chiron is the child born from the union of Zeus’ father, Cronos, and the fairy Philyra, but since Cronos copulated with her while transformed as a horse, Chiron, who was birthed, was born as a half-man, half-horse Centaur.  
  
Without upbringing Chiron, Philyra changed her form into a linden tree.  
  
In any case, a grown Chiron was endowed with all types of knowledge as a sage by the gods, and began upbringing a 「future hero」 before long.  
He had a friendship with Achilles’ father, Peleus, and Peleus trusted Chiron so much he entrusted Achilles to him when he realized he couldn’t raise Achilles.  
  
One day, the Centaurs and Heracles quarreled carried away by being drunk, and Chiron, who tried to stop them, received an arrow with poison of the Hydra.  
Chiron had acquired immortality as a god, but even though he was immortal he couldn’t escape from the pain of the poison, and continued tasting an infernal suffering.  
  
There, he begged to the gods, and chose to die by giving up his immortality.  
And it is told that because the gods regretted his death, he was sublimated as the stars of Sagittarius.  
  
## Character in FGO  
  
Even if it’s a normal Holy Grail War, or a special format ———— a situation of seven vs. seven, Chiron is a candidate for victory, and a sage that occupies an important position.  
  
That doesn’t change in Chaldea, and there is no end to the Servants requesting his teachings.  
  
The opposite is affirmative as well, for Chiron Chaldea, where owners of super-first class techniques and knowledge surpassing first class are striding, is an ideal workplace, and he’s impressed to have a new experience every day.  
  
## Standard Weapons  
  
Bow and arrows, empty-handed (pankration)  
  
## Related Characters  
  
**Achilles**  
  
I once fought you bare-handed.  
The outcome was uncertain, but…  
What do you think, how about we try it once here?  
  
**Former students**  
  
Oh, did everyone come too?  
My assistance may have been small, but even so it makes me quite proud and happy that all of you have become heroes.  
That said, there are still some parts that lack teaching.  
Come on, let us learn enthusiastically! Let’s work hard!  
  
**Zhuge Kongming**  
  
I see. That style of teaching is the power of the individual that became the vessel.  
Wonderful. If you don’t mind, could you teach me as well?  
  
**Sieg**  
  
Oh… It seems I fought together with you in the past.  
On that occasion, there wasn’t much of a temporal extension, but it’s different here.  
Now, let us study the course slow and carefully.  
  
## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
Teacher Intellimacho is the strongest. Making the adjustments around there were really difficult and I remember piling lots of attempts. Doesn’t it feel like he smells good of olives? Also, the decoration at the base of the tail is his charm point, so please have a look around the design picture’s bottom. Ah, please stop turning over the skirt, dear customer! It’s troubling!

## TL Notes  
  
[1]: Okay, but what does it do?  
[2]: RIP Clairvoyance. Why can't they always add discarded skills and say (Not used in FGO)? There are mats that have them.  
[3]: Antares is the brightest star of Scorpio. It's in the middle of the constellation and Arabs called it "the heart of the scorpion". The NP's name is literally "sniping the heart of the scorpion".
