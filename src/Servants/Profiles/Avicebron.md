## Class Skills  
  
**Territory Creation: [B]**  
  
Creates a territory advantageous to oneself as a mage.  
The formation of a “factory” uniquely specialized in the casting of golems is possible.  
  
  
**Item Construction: [B+]**  
  
Can create tools tinged with mana.  
Avicebron’s skill is specialized in golems, so he can’t create anything besides that.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
**Numerology: [B]**  
  
One of the magecraft systems, Kabbalah. By combining it with incantation shortenings from the Notarikon[1], instantly inputting multiple commands into multiple golems becomes possible.  
  
  
**High-Speed Incantation: [B+]**  
  
Only for incantations related to golems, he has a noteworthy speed.  
  
  
**Restful Fig Tree: [EX]**  
  
So says the legend.  
A man jealous of Avicebron’s poetic genius murdered him.  
The corpse was buried at the roots of a fig tree, but since the fig gave such delicious fruits, people thought it was strange and dag up, and discovered the corpse.  
An unusual skill that activates after being driven to withdrawal, annihilation, or similar.[2]  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Golem Keter Malkuth  
Royal crown: Light of knowledge  
  
  
Rank: A+  
Type: Anti-Army  
Range: 1~10  
Maximum number of targets: 100 people  
  
  
Golem Keter Malkuth.[3]  
Caster’s incomplete Noble Phantasm whose creation wasn’t fulfilled when he was alive.  
An autonomous-type Reality Marble that imitates『the primeval human (Adam)』, and continues repainting the World for as long as it exists.  
Even if the creator Caster perishes, it will continue moving without it mattering.  
It can obtain the blessing of the earth, and it will never perish as long as its feet are on the earth.  
Its weapon is an obsidian sword. In addition, unification with the being that will become the core as its motive power is necessary.  
If it’s a mage or someone with excellent Magical Circuits, this golem itself will increase its strength.  
  
  
However, Servants are fundamentally omitted.  
Because, for the sake of the objective that is the completion of paradise this Noble Phantasm must stay in the world for a long time, but in the case of Servants, the incorporated Magical Circuits disappear at the same time of their annihilation.  
Nourishment as a mere clump of mana is quite problematic, though.  
  
  
……Outside its original purpose, even if it’s temporary, in case an extremely high fighting power is required, it’s able to endure being used against Servants.  
But Avicebron, who acknowledges that 『temporary usage』 as blasphemous rarely makes use of it.  
And say nothing about fighting by using himself as the core ————  
  
  
Really, it’s something absolutely unconceivable.  
  
# Character  
  
## Pronouns  
  
First person pronoun: 僕 (boku)  
Second person pronoun: 君 (kimi)  
Third person pronoun: 彼 など (kare and similar)  
  
  
## Personality  
  
Mature, pessimistic… but.  
For good or for bad, he has a scholarly and too serious personality, good resignation, intense prejudices, and at times, he sometimes does preposterous things.  
  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
Fundamentally treats them with a reverent attitude.  
But, in the case that the Master is compatible as a core, he’s willing to betray them.  
Whereas they think it’s painful for him, he keeps acting with cool-headed thinking.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
「Combat is my weak point.  
But a mage properly prepares the means to make up for that.」  
  
  
「Be born from the earth (mother), drink the wind (knowledge), be filled with water (life);  
if you swing the fire (weapon), disease (the devil) shall go away.  
Righteousness shall guide your blood to purity.  
Thy name that embraces Ru’ach[4], is Adam!」  
  
  
「A long journey and cruel decisions await you.  
But I believe.  
——— Fight, young boy/girl. I trust.  
That only humans have the strength[5] to endure this responsibility!」  
  
## Historical Character and Figure (Investigation: Miwa Kiyomune)  
  
His official name is Solomon ben Judah ibn Gabirol.  
There isn’t any relation in particular with the ancient king Solomon. [6]  
He was a philosopher and poet from the 11th century, and a Kabbalist that dealt with one genre of magecraft, the Kabbalah.  
His achievements include introducing ideas from ancient Greece that were preserved in the Arabian culture sphere into the European culture sphere.  
His philosophy itself wasn’t accepted in Europe, but it is told that the foundations of the Renaissance were built inspired by a rebuttal to those teachings.  
  
  
It was commented that because of his weak constitution he was pessimistic and 「seemed like an 80 year-old elder despite being 16 years old」.[7]  
As a poet, elegies were said to be his forte.  
  
## About Golems (Investigation: Miwa Kiyomune)  
  
Golems are considered robots manufactured by some magecraft, but they’re originally a mystery of Kabbalah ——— Judaism, meaning “fetus” “one who is not formed”, truly the esoteric art with which the Lord created Adam from a lump of earth.  
  
  
By breathing your breath (Ru’ach) into the golems produced from a lump of earth, they obtain life, and move.  
The golems in this state don’t have any knowledge, and become existences that move according to their creator’s will.  
But, since they have no knowledge they sometimes move distorting the orders of their creator, and to manage them correctly, the correct orders must be inputted.  
It could be said that appearance is similar to the relationship between humans and machines from recent times, computers.  
  
  
In order to defeat or dispose of a golem, the general method is to erase the “e” from the word emeth (more accurately, in Hebrew), meaning “truth”, carved on its forehead (top of the head) (or written in an affixed parchment), and changing it to “meth”, which means “death”; but being strict this is not a weakness.  
  
  
The miracle of a golem is recreating the miracle of the Lord by blowing life into a vessel of earth, and although an imitation, in order to destroy that, a power surpassing that miracle is required.  
For that reason, the word “emeth” isn’t a weakness, but the golem’s emergency stop device… It would be better to call it a method established as safety.  
  
## Character in FGO  
  
There is no change about him being a misanthrope even after having been summoned as a Servant,  
but he’s making an effort to communicate a little positively, as if there were various things to think about.  
However, he isn’t very fond of being called teacher.  
  
  
He is ignorant about the subtleties of the emotions of others, but he is never dull.  
But if the reasons lie beyond logic, he’s likely to be confused.  
In short, his state has mostly become『knowing that you’re angry, but not knowing why you’re angry』

Should I say my blunder resulted in you being here?  
In any case, you’re here now ———— God bless you.

## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
Have you ever thought 「Jeez, if only I had another pair of hands」 when working or making experiments? This is why, Teacher steadily remodeled himself and became very convenient. He can compete in video-games alone! Of course he can advance in the laps! What is being cultivated in Seitō[8]… No, the Saint Graph’s behind is artificial muscles. The golem hybrid fellow is using organic components. Fresh red meat. …Oh, today’s dinner menu in Chaldea’s cafeteria is steak! By the way, what meat is this? (Konoe Ototsugu)  
  
## TL Notes  
  
[1]: A method of deriving words by using the initial and/or final letters stand for another. IRL Kabbalists used this method to find out a deeper meaning of things in the Bible.  
  
[2]: And it does....?  
  
[3]: Keter Malkuth (The Royal Crown) is the title of one of Avicebron's works. It's a text that measures the spehres of the Universe and makes the reader feel small but at the same time praises them with a proclamation of divine grace. At the same time, Keter and Malkuth are the highest and lowest sephirot of the Tree of Life.  
  
[4]: In Kabbalah, the middle soul, the spirit. It contains moral virtues and the ability to distinguish good from evil.  
  
[5]: Written 強靭さ instead of 強さ. 強靭 can also mean "tenacious".  
  
[6]: This clarification isn't just because he's called Solomon too. Apparently, a 12th century philosopher mistranslated his signature as "Solomon, the Jew, the king", and attributed many of his works to THE Solomon.  
  
[7]: Avicebron was said to have lupus vulgaris, skin lesions produced by tuberculosis. He actually had a complex about this, and described himself as "short and ugly" in some poems.  
  
[8]: Written 聖闘, as in 聖闘士星矢. I don't know if it's actually a reference to Saint Seiya.
