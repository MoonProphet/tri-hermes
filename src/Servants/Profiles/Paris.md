## Class Skills  
  
**Magic Resistance: [B]**  
  
Negates magecraft with three or fewer verses on their activation. It's difficult to harm him even with Greater Magecraft or Ritual Curses.  
  
**Independent Action: [EX]**  
  
Paris himself doesn't have the Independent Action Skill, but Apollo, who is something like a guardian angel to him, will do his thing without answering to anyone.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
**Eye of the Sun God (False): [B+]**  
  
Danger evasion through instinct and sixth sense.  
  
It's supposed to be ranked A, but Paris's recklessness drops the rank.  
  
**Affection of the Male God: [B]**  
  
Paris receives Apollo's affection.  
  
It's a real nuisance, but Paris appreciates it to some extent.  
  
This Skill is almost identical to Affection of the Goddess, with the same precedent for love turning into disaster.  
  
**Dystychia Milo: [EX]**  
  
Actually a Noble Phantasm.  
  
A golden apple with the power of the gods.  
  
See the Noble Phantasm section for more details.  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Troia Velos (Everlasting radiant arrow)  
- Rank: A  
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 1-10  
- Max. Targets: 1 person  
  
An arrow shot with his utmost efforts, borrowing power for the sun god Apollo.  
  
It overcomes any and all obstacles to land a guaranteed hit on the enemy's weak spot.  
  
However, a prerequisite to doing so is knowing the enemy's weak spot.  
  
A killer move against heroes with famous weak spots.  
  
This doesn't apply only to Achilles. If his weakness is revealed, Paris could even defeat Siegfried, whose body was hardened by dragon blood... maybe.  
  
  
# Dystychia Milo (Golden apple beckoning discord)  
- Rank: EX  
- Type: Anti-Unit  
- Range: 0  
- Max. Targets: 1 person  
  
The apple of misfortune.  
  
An apple with the gods' power to bring discord.  
  
This apple was supposed to be only a present to the most beautiful goddess, and yet it caused the Trojan War.  
  
The apple itself has no destructive power, but it ultimately causes great destruction. And this destruction doesn't tell friend and foe apart.

## Pronouns  
  
First-person pronoun: Boku  
  
Second-person pronoun: anata  
  
Third-person pronoun: Kare/Kanojo/Aitsu (exclusive to Achilles)  
  
## Personality  
  
He was summoned as a boy, not an adult.  
  
He retains his indecisive personality and sorta lets others do the thinking for him.  
  
This pretty boy can't hide the fact he's something of a loser, but some women take the fact he's a loser as all the more reason to love him.  
  
He's a hard worker, but he tends to jump to wildly wrong conclusions, and often makes fatal mistakes due to being instigated by the gods or whatever is happening.  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
He's generally trying to behave like a model Servant.  
  
But his airheadedness doesn't let him.  
  
He's innocently stupid, and stupidly pure.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
"Hello! I'm Paris! Is my brother Hektor present? He is. Yay!"  
  
## Historical Character and Figure  
  
Paris was almost killed by the words of an oracle on the night he was born. The tale of his birth was a case of misfortune often seen in Greek mythology.  
  
Luck allowed him to survive this purge, but he was abandoned in the mountains, having to suck milk from a bear to survive. And then Paris started living as a shepherd.  
  
His fate took a sudden turn when Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite were fighting over the Golden Apple. That is, during the Judgement of Paris.  
  
Although he already had a wife, he responded to Aphrodite's tempting offer of marrying him to the most beautiful woman in the world (one as beautiful as herself) and chose her as the most beautiful goddess.  
  
The woman Aphrodite considered the most beautiful in the world was Helen, wife of King Menelaus.  
  
Paris was still young, pure, and filled with hopes and dreams, so he and Helen fell in love on their first encounter... and that's the start of the Trojan War.  
  
## Character in FGO  
  
Purity, innocence, and bravery are all aspects of humanity seen as positive, but some critics would say that only makes them worse as flaws.  
  
He's straightforward, for better or for worse. The moment he learned about Helen's unfortunate wedded life, he took her away.  
  
He was being instigated by the gods, yes, but that was still an act of justice on his part.  
  
Hektor knew his little brother's actions would lead to big problems, but did nothing to stop him.  
  
Since the gods intervened, a war would inevitably happen at some point, regardless of reason, and he knew both sides were putting their pride on the line, with no room for compromises.  
  
Paris met a regretful and heartbreaking end in the Trojan War.  
  
But upon being summoned, he fights with simple honesty, without ever sulking. Consider him earnest, in a sense.  
  
However, beware of Apollo, the one who comes bundled with Paris.  
  
He considers preserving Paris his first priority and has little to no concern for anything else, not even his Master.  
  
Apollo is safe while he thinks people are amusing, which turning the words around means that you must be wary of what that Apollo behind Paris will do if he judges you as boring.  
  
## In Atlantis  
  
He fulfilled a containment role, continuously firing arrows from Achilles's chariot.  
  
Although he survived the naval battle, he ultimately chose to be converted into an arrow to activate Orion's Noble Phantasm.  
  
A pure golden arrow, tossing his fears and regrets away to concern himself only with flying forward.  
  
This arrow most certainly carried Orion's heart to pierce Artemis's core.  
  
## Standard Weapons  
  
**Apollo's bow**  
  
Always hits, never misses.  
  
**Apollo (avatar)**  
  
That pile of sheep is actually another weapon.  
  
Apollo kinda likes the rough treatment.  
  
## Related Characters  
  
**Hektor**  
  
His glorious brother.  
  
Paris wants to surpass him but believes he never will.  
  
Hektor personally thinks his little brother proved himself at the very end of Atlantis, with a crazy decision Hektor himself would never even consider.  
  
## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
He may look like a blond girl at first glance, but that's the legendarily pretty boy Paris. This has been Kususaga Rin, delivering the boys with 300% more shota-ness. Good day. The concept for him was... a boy who looks like a girl but is most definitively a boy! I aimed to give him strikingly different outfits between Ascensions to portray three completely different species of cuteness, but all I did was work myself to death three times... But a shepherd boy ascending into a sheep (costume) is good civilization. I tried to make the Apollo with him into a Unquestionably Cute Mascot(tm), but later I played the game and found out he's a shitbag without a single good bone in his body. Wonderful. That threw his cuteness out of the window... It's amazing how you can feel the evil in his eyes... Also, after drawing Paris, I gained a reputation as the gender-unidentifiable character illustrator. It's a huge honor! I'll devote myself to drawing more than just piss[1]! (Go to hell) (Kususaga Rin)  
  
## TL Note  
  
At the end of 2017, Kususaga Rin published a Rama/Sita doujin that attracted a small bit of discourse in the Japanese fandom over its kinky portrayal of Sita peeing on Rama.
