## Personal Skills  
  
**The Golden Rule (Body): [A]**  
  
One possesses a perfect goddess-like body since birth. No matter how many calories one absorbs, even their figure will not change. Unlike the Natural Body Skill, there is no effect on one’s Strength Parameter. In the end, it is said that it is no more than one’s beauty being preserved.  
  
**Charisma: [B]**  
  
Medb has the charismatic nature to manipulate many brave warriors as a military force.  
  
**Beautiful Voice of Captivation: [C]**  
  
A natural constitution of having a beautiful voice. It works as a magical charm effect towards males, but evasion is possible with the Magical Resistance Skill. Even if one does not have Magical Resistance, they can abate it to some extent so long as they maintain a will to resist.  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Chariot My Love: My Dear Iron Chariot  
- Rank: B  
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 2~40  
- Maximum Number of Targets: 50 people  
  
Medb mounts the “chariot” that embodies her own powerful influence and performs a charging attack. An area of effect attack. It is a two-unit chariot that uses the bulls associated with the “Táin Bó Cúailnge”, and this chariot represents the lord’s royal authority that rules over the people, the steel that oppresses the people, and the fear that makes the people tremble. It is particularly effective against males. It is difficult for any man to brush aside the approaching Medb. In “Fate/Grand Order”, it has been readjusted (retuned) from being an Anti-Army Noble Phantasm into an Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm.  
  
No man caught in Medb’s chariot can escape it, no matter what. Her chariot room has already changed into a Reality Marble by then, a love nest that will not set them free until the deed is finished.  
  
# My Red Mead: My Dear Honey Wine  
- Rank: C  
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 1~20  
- Maximum Number of Targets: 50 people  
  
Medb brings a torrent of golden mead infused with her legend of charm, presenting it while showing a smile and saying, “Please.” When they are being hostile, somehow, men will take that alcohol. If one gulps it down his mouth, by then, it is even the same as a man who became her property.  
  
# Conchobar My Love: My Dear Future Vision  
- Rank: C  
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm  
- Range: None  
- Maximum Number of Targets: Herself  
  
Medb temporarily borrows the ability of future vision possessed by Ulster King Conchobar, who was her husband for a period of time.  
  
# Fergus My Love: My Dear Rainbow Sword  
- Rank: A+  
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 20~40  
- Maximum Number of Targets: 300 people  
  
Medb temporarily summons the magic sword Caladbolg, the Noble Phantasm of her lover Fergus, and with a lovely swing while saying, “Take thattt”, she releases a rainbow shimmering from the sword. An area of effect attack of the Great Spin in the Sky of Heaven and Earth.

## Pronouns  
  
First Person Pronoun: watashi  
Second Person Pronouns: anata / omae / ○○-chan  
Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / ano hito / ○○ (without honorifics)  
  
## Personality  
  
A tidy and pure girl. Simultaneously, a lewd and vicious girl.  
  
Tidy and pure. Lewd and vicious. Both sets are her true images, and either one of them is said to not be a fabrication. It is just that the “impression” many people catch is the former. Medb just earnestly likes lewdness neatly and cleanly, and earnestly performs viciousness purely. She loves fine men. She loves strong men! She will love a man even more if he does not succumb to her! It will be worth the torment for some of them! Absolutely not going against her lust, she made a great number of men her own property during her lifetime. Fergus, the owner of the magic sword Caladbolg, was one of her lovers too. She also loves riches, and for that motive, she caused a great war, took on the whole nation of Ulster as her opponent, and commanded the Connacht troops while driving her chariot.  
  
Because Medb thinks she is the center of the world, she will turn up to a large event even on some occasions where she is not invited. “After all, doesn’t it seem pitiful to not notice such things, even though I spent money on things like these? Nevertheless, do be at peace, for I have arrived now! The center of the world, the chosen leading actress, Queen Medb, the ruler of everything!” Even though this is an action according to a person who craves the limelight, Medb herself is uncontrollable within the vicinity when one considers the good of everybody else nearby.  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
Medb deems her Master as a “temporarily master”. However, she openly perceives the system called Servant and Master like some kind of play, and she does not take into consideration of it very seriously. She herself relatively enjoys the state of affairs around herself.  
  
Although her obsession towards Cú Chulainn still remains, the wish Medb wants to make on the Holy Grail is something unrelated to him. Namely, “to make all wonderful men of the past/present/future as her lovers.” If possible, brave warriors who are often generous, without jealousy, and knows no fear would be nice. If her Master is a brave man who conforms to her discernment, Medb will probably slap her love freely onto him with all her energy without caring about public attention. Severely, relentlessly, just like the whip she uses in that particular way.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
“I’m Medb. Queen Medb! I wonder, are you a wonderful brave warrior who will fight for me?”  
  
“Master! Ah, I wonder what this is called. How could I serve someone? Still, this might occasionally be interesting. Fine then. For a modest time, let me be your whip.”  
  
“All my darlings, please lend me your strength!”  
“There was a great amount of men who tried to make me theirs, but I wonder… how about you?"  
  
“————Cú Chulainn. The man who will not become mine. Even nowadays, he appears before me, and then, he will still not become mine.”  
  
## Historical Character and Figure  
  
Queen Medb. The Eternal Lady. The Queen of Connacht who appears in the Ulster Cycle of Celtic Mythology. A girl of affairs who built engagements, marriages, and at times, nothing but sexual relations with kings and brave warriors in great numbers. The ringleader who caused the greatest war of the Ulster Cycle, she was after the life of Cú Chulainn, the brave warrior of Ulster who defied her. It is said that she is even endowed with aspects of discord and conflict as a Divine Spirit that rules over regal powers, evil and insanity.  
  
Even in modern Ireland, there are many sighting cases where people have said “I saw her.” Of course, those are not a kind of joke. Even now in the hearts of people, Queen Medb, as the Eternal Lady, lives on.  
  
## Character in FGO  
  
“… I don’t really hate being antagonized.”  
“However, I can’t tolerate the fact that, among the men of Ulster, there’s one man, only one man, who didn’t become mine, even though I thought “I want him”. Even though I called out to him, even though I enticed him. Not at all being swayed by me, that attitude of his is as if he’s even saying, “What the heck are YOU doing?”!”  
“I won’t forgive him. Won’t forgive won’t forgive won’t forgive won’t forgive won’t forgive! THAT GUY, absolutely────”  
“Cú Chulainn of Ulster! I swear by the name of Medb, the ruler who became the lover of all men! Because I’ll show everyone that you will absolutely submit to me!”  
  
◆  
  
Medb has been called the mother of many warriors, but it is not because she actually gives birth to those warriors. After she takes in the genetic information of warriors, she reproduces those inside her body. When she wounds the tip of her index finger with a blade, the moment her blood falls onto the ground, what was no more than a single drop of blood then becomes a large pool of blood right after, and as the blood foams, warriors are “manufactured” from it. Medb is literally the ruler who became the “Queen” of nameless warriors.  
  
## Related Characters  
  
**Cú Chulainn**  
  
As aforementioned, Cu-chan LOVE. When he became Alter, even more LOVE.  
  
**Fergus**  
  
“Since that wonderful brave warrior of Ulster would fall madly in love with me like so, isn’t that proof of my beauty and loveliness?”  
  
**Male Servants she has a liking for**  
  
Medb wants to make them her lovers altogether. The type she is fond of the most is a man “who is often generous, without jealousy, and knows no fear.”  
  
**Fionn mac Cumhaill**  
  
“Men who get jealous has not a chance. Also, even my instincts are saying no way.”  
  
## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
Given that Medb’s design concept needed the impression that her clothing is going to be undressed in succession rather than saying that they’re being changed, it resulted in the concept of Medb’s transformation being seen as a small amount of clothes being worn underneath her outer layers.  
  
Stage 1: It’s a snugly specification that won’t let her catch a cold even if Cu-chan stands up his Christmas date with her. When drawing a derived work, this is the recommended stage to be drawn since it’s the most comfortable for one to draw, right? Also, because I’m pleased with this one the most, I personally keep her battle sprite in this state.  
  
Stage 2: Because I received the specification called a white female knight, this stage was imagined first. The other stages were created by adding and subtracting from here.  
  
Stage 3: Although I imagined sexy underwear, she’s somewhat like a powerful princess, no, a “reigning champion of the ring”, isn’t she? I certainly want her to start up something like a New Celtic Pro Wrestling promotion! Entering gaudily while being accompanied by an assistant wearing a bull costume!  
  
Hey, with that sort of feeling, I’d like to see Medb’s actions in FGO, no matter how surprising they are! (Takayama Kisai)
