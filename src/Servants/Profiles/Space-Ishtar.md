## Class Skills  
  
**Magic Resistance: [C]**  
  
Invalidates magic below C rank.  
Her high magic resistance as an Archer-class cannot be displayed in the Servant Universe.  
  
**Independent Action: [C]**  
  
S Ishtar, who was born as a goddess, raised as a mortal and awakened as a Servant, does not consume mana to remain materialized even without being contracted to a Master.  
  
**Divine Core of the Goddess: [A++]**  
  
A skill symbolizing that one has been a perfect goddess from her birth. It possesses the effect of preserving the absoluteness of the mind and the body.  
It repels just about every kind of mental interference while preventing the body from growing and the figure from changing no matter how many calories are intaken.  
It is also a composite skill that comprises the Divinity skill.  
Having inherited the Divine Core of the "Ancient Goddess of Fertility and War"...who served as a prototype for the many goddesses that possessed the likeness of Ishtar...Ishtar, Astarte, Anat, it has become nearly top-rank.  
  
**Avenger: [EX]**  
  
The state of an avenger as one that gathers people's hatreds and grudges onto oneself having turned into a skill.  
Something that mixes together the anger and pain she felt from how the Great Goddess had become regarded as a lowly devil for some reason, and the sorrow felt that "...thinking back on it, I really have no excuse for ending up like that, do I...".  
This goddess who regards herself as evil while standing on the side of justice (order) feels somewhat unfit to be an avenger.  
※In the Old Testament, this goddess is named "Ashtoret", which was used to refer to fertility goddesses or foreign goddesses, but this name born from the Old Testament would rather be degraded into that of a demon (Astaroth) in Western Europe.  
  
**Oblivion Correction: [A]**  
  
People are creatures that forget many things, but avengers never forget.  
Love and hate from the distant past that humans cannot perceive. Her act of venting her anger on the humans who have forgotten her past majesty and authority, or rather, her iron hammer against injustice, becomes incredibly powerful.  
  
**Avenger: [EX]**  
  
S Ishtar's Magical Energy endlessly surges until her revenge is accomplished, until she feels refreshed.  
The nature of the "Goddess of Origin" who got excited all on her own when left alone and arbitrarily started a final war had become a skill without any changes.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
**Devil's Sugar: [A]**  
  
Even while being bothered by having been reduced to a mere demon, she makes thorough use of her powers of "seduction and arousal", just like a true demon would.  
S Ishtar's smiles and blown kisses raise the morale of her allies, allowing them to ignore the burden on their bodies and draw out power beyond their limits. Since what's being used on her allies is pretty much a charm (curse), they won't be affected by the enemy's charms since they are already head over heels for S Ishtar.  
You might as well call this the Charisma of a Demon that combined her facet as a goddess of victory and her facet as a demon.  
  
**Venus Driver: [B]**  
  
The operator of Venus. The driver of beauty.  
The divine protection of Venus increases the power of her Noble Phantasm in addition to changing its attribute at will. A skill fitting for the "Goddess of Origin" who had numerous goddesses derived from her in the end.  
  
**Multiple Starling: [EX]**  
  
A single great crown.  
What returned to its original form by stacking up the crowns of the many goddesses fit to be "queens of the heaven" that were derived from the goddess that served as Ishtar's origin.  
It grants a great amount of NP and can increase the performance of every card with a high probability.  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Edin Shugurra Quasar (The Crown Shining in the Primordial Cosmos)  

- Rank: EX
- Classification: Anti-Planet Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1000~depends on her mood
- Maximum number of targets: Depends on her mood (changes based on her frame of mind)
  
Edin Shugurra Quasar.  
An Anti-Alien Invasion Noble Phantasm that calls forth the Temple Bel Maanna - which could be called the "Symbol of the Goddess" in the Primordial Universe - before unleashing the "High Dimensional Soul"─────the Saint Graph Galaxy making up the Temple and burning up a whole sector (of space) after converting it into energy.  
  
In the Sumerian and Akkadian languages, 'Edin' means steppe or field. This is said to be the origin of the word 'Eden' that appears in the Old Testament.  
'Shugurra' is the crown that was in that Edin. It is what was given to Ishtar when she entered Edin.  
'Quasar' is a modern-age astronomy term. It means 'quasi-stellar'.  
They are called the "brightest celestial bodies" due to emitting powerful light and are found in sectors that are very far away from the Earth.  
  
It is a Noble Phantasm that damages every enemy, but it also has the added effect of increasing the damage dealt by the Extra card during the turn it was used.  
"If you're gonna use S Ishtar's Noble Phantasm then go as far as the Extra attack", is what it's saying.

* First person pronoun: watashi (in kanji)
* Second person pronoun: anata (in katakana)/○○○(name without honorifics) S Ishtar: (when exasperated) anta (in katakana)/ (also when she feels "Ah geez!" towards the Master) anta (in katakana) Astarte: (only when it comes to the Master) anata (in hiragana) Ishtar-Astarte: anata (in kanji)
* Third person pronoun: anata-tachi
  
## Personality  
  
(※There are subtle differences in her personality and standpoint between ascensions 1, 2, and 3, but, fundamentally, her personality is as listed below)  
She is an outlaw while also a heroine of justice.  
She has an odd standpoint where she makes villain-like moves, but everything she does is for the sake of others.  
She perceives herself as a "threat to humanity" and her alignment has become "evil" as well, but that does not mean she is a bad guy or a villain.  
Her personality is almost the same as Ishtar's, but she will never toy with others to entertain herself.  
She acknowledges the good deeds of others with pride, deeming them "righteous actions" and feeling all happy about them in secret, while she scowls with hostility at the evil deeds of others, deeming them "something horrible" as she hurls abuses at them with great gusto.  
(And in case the other party is a villain, she'll wring out their assets, life, and destiny)  
  
Like Ishtar, S Ishtar has a free and uninhibited personality and is concerned about the cruelty and shallowness of human society; apart from that, she takes people's livelihood into consideration to some extent, cares about good humans in her own way, and ultimately puts the victory of everyone above her own rewards... And so, she acts in a way that isn't reminiscent of Ishtar.  
  
For example, even if she were to - like Ishtar did during the Summer Race - attempt to resurrect Gugalanna at the expense of her surroundings to regain her authority, in S Ishtar's case she would surely reflect on herself, destroy Gugalanna with her own hands and share the resources with the race's participants in the end.  
"Well, this is such a waste that I'd love to go on a rampage in frustration, but I felt like this was what had to be done! See, you just can't lie to yourself, right?"  
In this manner, while she is basically Ishtar herself, she would never become humanity's enemy in the final stage......in other words, S Ishtar is a goddess who is "bad in terms of being Ishtar".  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
She is extremely interested in the thing known as the "Master" who contracts and uses Servants despite being just a human.  
"Eh? There is such a job like that in your world? Isn't that amazing even though you're a human!?"  
Having recognized humans as "weak beings", she is honestly impressed that one is able to comprehend and communicate with Servants.  
While she does not respect the Master, she perceives them as "someone important",  
"I'll listen to what you say as long as I feel like it♡" she says with the smile of a little devil.  
  
Since she is from a different universe and a different world, she does her best not to empathize with the Master more than necessary, but since the guard of her heart (love flags) is weak, she is guaranteed to stray from the path at a moment's notice.  
Since regular Ishtar's sense of distance is close, she possesses the "appeal of a neighborhood older sister", but due to SW2 Ishtar's unduly distant manner, the appeal of a neighborhood older sister is diminished. In exchange, her impression as a heroine who "despite being somewhat out of your league, is shining right beside you" is strong.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
First Ascension: Supreme Ruler of Evil Ishtar Composed, somewhat aggressive polite language. A young lady of great upbringing. Fundamentally earnest and polite.  
However, she is always in a bad mood (angry). When she reveals her true colors, she becomes the usual Rin. She's got a sharp tongue when expressing her anger.  
  
Second Ascension: Cowgirl Ishtar  
Unreserved and confident, her tone combines the boldness of the wilds with the lightness of a young girl. What she does might be dangerous, but it is based on justice.  
She keeps others more at a distance than regular Ishtar (since ultimately, she does not want to depend on others). She is a heroine of justice, she isn't satisfied until she returns the humiliation and loans she received many times over.  
  
Third Ascension: Goddess of Origin Ishtar  
The personality of a transcendental being. Her lines are more machine-like and lacking in emotion. She is the cool and mysterious-chan kind.  
While it might be difficult to put emotions into her lines, she is "the protector of humanity, the goddess born for humanity's sake" resulting from the union/fusion of the first and second ascensions.  
She is of the "kind on the inside even if her tone is cold" faction. However, she has a very sharp tongue when she goes on angry rants. Her designation as a "Threat to Humanity" is gone due to having changed to the side that protects humanity.  
  
## Setting  
  
Space Ishtar is "the goddess that exists in reality" in the Servant Universe.  
   
She is not "the goddess of the Venus seen (observed) by Earthlings who presides over said planet", but "the goddess of Venus who arose in the ancient civilization on Venus," so from an Earthling's perspective, it could be said that she is an alien herself.  
   
Her outward appearance matches that of Fate/EXTRA's Tohsaka Rin.  
The Primordial Universe refers to the "universe in which humans were humans" that existed way before the Sapphire Galaxy (The ether universe. The world of the current Universe.); even further back in that ancient universe─────before the birth of mammals on Earth, the goddess worshipped by the prehistoric ancient civilization of that universe was Astarte.  
During those times, the concept of faith did not exist; the word goddess referred to "the sector of space where life can exist".  
It is not clear whether that concept took shape or whether that way of being was used as a concept, but Ishtar-Astarte of the Primordial Universe became "a galaxy taking on the shape of a human".  
Originally, she is not something that mortals could handle or something that could become a Servant.  
(At the climax of SW2, no attack would work on the "Astarte from the times of the Primordial Universe" that appeared as a boss, but that was due to this "galaxy lifeform argument". Since she is actually a galaxy, the attacks of humans are way too tiny so they can only pass through her.)  
   
Since the universe has transformed from the Primordial Universe into the Sapphire Galaxy, the ancient civilization moved on from this dimension and Astarte was supposed to also become a simple galaxy and fall into a slumber.  
However, the greedy (desiring to see more of the universe's future and human civilization) Astarte refused to obey the rules of the Sapphire Galaxy and remained as an evil goddess.  
   
Spreading as the Primordial Universe, Astarte became the "Crimson Taboo Space Sector" and continued to remain within the Sapphire Galaxy.  
The time her Divine Core took shape and she clearly began to erode the Sapphire Universe was 2000 years ago.  
To avoid this, the Goddess Subjugation A Team (including Jane and Sigurd) was put together and they destroyed the core of the goddess that served as the center of the Taboo Space Sector. Astarte once again fell into a slumber.  
   
And then, a few hundred years later.  
Within the ruins of the altar of the Primordial Universe, Professor Tokiomi found Astarte who "reincarnated as human" sleeping inside a crystal cradle.  
   
In secret, Professor Tokiomi took custody of this crystal cradle and took it home.  
After that, unconsciously, the goddess divided herself into an "evil half" and a "good half". This gave humanity a choice: Which one would they pick? Which one could they coexist with?  
After thinking it over carefully, Tokiomi decided to raise the "evil half" as a "good goddess".  
   
Thus, knowing nothing, S Ishtar developed at a rapid rate.  
However, on S Ishtar's 14th birthday, Professor Tokiomi was killed by Space Shinkage-ryuu, an evil organization that got wind of the existence of the Goddess of Origin, Astarte, and the "other half" that was hidden in the house was also stolen.  
(S Ishtar wasn't told about this other half)  
   
Left on her own, Tokiomi's daughter, S Ishtar became a bounty hunter and chased after Space Shinkage-ryuu to avenge her father.  
The other half that Space Shinkage-ryuu took with them was raised as the "Daughter of the Supreme Ruler of Evil, Astarte" so Space Shinkage-ryuu could use her as a tool for ruling the universe.  
   
The two Ishtars don't know.  
About the existence of the other. And just which is "good" and which is "evil".  
  
## Ascension 1: Ishtar as the Supreme Ruler of Evil  
The genius swordswoman raised by the evil organization, Space Shinkage-ryuu, who eventually reached the rank of supreme ruler.  
Cold and gloomy, but has excellent manners.  
In truth, she is the "good half".  
To her, Space Shinkage-ryuu is like a family and she works hard every day for the sake of achieving their dearest wish.  
  
## Ascension 2: Ishtar as a bounty hunter cowgirl  
The gunman of justice raised by the strict but kind Professor Tokiomi.  
A free and uninhibited young girl who goes at full power when it comes to living life.  
Due to the shock of having her father killed, her body stopped developing when she was 14. (The same goes for Astarte)  
In truth, she is the "evil half".  
To take revenge on the Space Shinkage-ryuu that killed her father, her class changed from Archer to Avenger...or so she believes, but her class was Avenger from the start.  
  
## Ascension 3: Ishtar of the Primordial Universe  
Her appearance as a goddess that awakened to an even greater extent.  
Ishtar doing a classic final boss-like move that was unlikely to happen.  
In this form, she can bring out the Bel Maanna.  
  
## ■Ancient Temple Bel Maanna  
S Ishtar is not "always on her boat" like Ishtar.  
What S Ishtar calls forth is a temple (the temple of Baal, which is said to have been built by Anat), its appearance ominous and form aggressive...that is what's been told, but...  
  
## ■Goddess Temple Bel Maanna  
At the end of SW2, Ishtar and the protagonist arrived at primordial coordinate X, an area of the Sapphire (Ether) Cosmos - the cosmos of the Servant Universe - where entry is forbidden.  
There, the supreme ruler of evil, Ishtar-Astarte, and Space Munenori were lying in wait for them.  
Something like a temple is floating at coordinate X; this is Bel Maanna, which is said to be "the temple that was once used by the Goddess of Origin".  
With the disappearance of the goddess, Bel Maanna collapsed, but with the goddess' revival, it reactivated itself.  
In the story, it was oftentimes described as an "ancient shrine" so everyone was picturing it as a temple, but the Bel Maanna that has been restored to its full glory turned out to be a spaceship in the form of a super-giant-sized Ishtar.  
Bel Maanna is Ishtar-Astarte's blade and also a part of herself; only by using this "Goddess Temple" can she be the true "Goddess of Origin".  
  
## ■Astarte Origin  
The last boss that revived along with Bel Maanna.  
The gaseous nebula concealing coordinate X is "the particles of Astarte that scattered after her defeat".  
After Astarte's successful revival ceremony, the galaxy of coordinate x converged in a single spot, gathering together into the shape of a woman and becoming Astarte Origin.  
Since Astarte is "a galaxy that took the form of a goddess", attacks below galaxy size are invalidated.

## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
According to Space Ishtar's initial setting, there was only one character, and the trend was that said one character would transform through ascension. However, in the settings of the character that I received, there were 3 characters: a good, an evil, and a space-like one. Since they each had parents and their own personal histories, I ended up imagining the lives and lifestyles that each of them have built up so I did not want to omit any of them which I told Nasu-san as well. That there are 3 characters, aren't there. And that's how we ended up with around 3 characters. In terms of the direction for the design, for her first ascension, I expanded the image from her countenance when she was a mimic in "hollow". The second one is in the style of a free-spirited bounty-hunter cowgirl pairing up with her partner Jane, and the third was designed with a not-so MADE IN JIGOKU feel. Since the three are identical yet different characters, I paid attention to making them appear as their own existences even if they were to be lined up next to each other so it wouldn't feel like the character was simply changing her outfit. The ribbon is the same as the one worn in "EXTRA". I asked Hirai Yukio-san to design the Maanna spaceship that flies through the galaxy. I'm so grateful to him... At first, we were going to go with a gigantic spaceship like in Independence Day for the Goddess Temple, but god-knows-how, it ended up with the form of a giant goddess. (Morii Shizuki)
