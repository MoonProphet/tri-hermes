## Class Skills  
  
**Magical Resistance: [A]**  
  
Nullifies Magecraft spells that are Rank A or below.  
  
Modern mages would not be able to wound Bradamante with their Magecraft.  
  
Bradamante’s original Rank in the Magical Resistance Skill is C, but it is being increased considerably to its current Rank due to the effect of one of her Noble Phantasms.  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
**Clermont’s Merit: [B]**  
  
One’s pride and mentality as a person who was born in the House of Clermont becoming a Skill.  
  
In order to catch up to her elder brother Renaud and his fierce swordsmanship techniques, Bradamante tried every single thing. Even if she was an ordinary person, even if what she was doing is liable to madness, and even if it was a gruesome battlefield, she will run past people from behind to move forward. Bradamante will not give up in any way, and she will catch hold of victory.  
  
**Knight of the White Wings: [B+]**  
  
A Skill that demonstrates the intrinsic robust health of one’s body and the ability to continue combat. It comprises the effects of the Battle Continuation Skill and some parts of the Robust Health Skill.  
  
Even if she tumbled down to the depths of Merlin’s Cave, Bradamante would be okay.  
  
**Magic Cancellation: [A]**  
  
Cancels magical effects on oneself or one of their allies. If it is a Magecraft that is Rank B or below, it is automatically cancelled, but in order to cancel Magecraft that is Rank A or above, a Luck Check becomes necessary.  
  
It is a Skill originating from Bradamante’s Second Noble Phantasm.  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
# Bouclier d’Atlantes: Dazzlingly Beautiful is the Flashing Magic Shield of Light  
- Rank: B  
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 1~30  
- Maximum Number of Targets: 100 people  
  
Bouclier d’Atlantes (Shield of Atlantes). A magic shield that had once been owned by the evil mage Atlantes, who had abducted Bradamante’s lover, Rogero. The shield can emit an intense light of Magical Energy by means of its True Name Release, causing damage to its targets while also forcing them to undergo a Stun Check. Even if they end up not being stunned at the conclusion of their Check, by having their eyes blinded by the light, their Agility Parameter would be temporarily lowered considerably.  
  
Furthermore, one should not primarily strike with a shield. Yet for Bradamante, it appears that her spirits are rising too high on the occasion of her materialization in the present world, so after dazzling her targets with the light emitted from her shield, she almost unconsciously rushes forward to strike at them with it.  
  
It has been said that Bradamante, who defeated Atlantes, obtained the shield the latter owned and even got the Phantasmal Beast Hippogriff he rode on too. (If she was summoned in the Rider Class, the Hippogriff would fully come along with her for sure.)  
  
# Angelica Cathay: Resplendently Beautiful is the Ring of the Pretty Princess  
- Rank: C  
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm / Barrier Noble Phantasm  
- Range: 1~10  
- Maximum Number of Targets: 30 people  
  
A mysterious ring that had once been owned by Angelica, a beautiful princess of a foreign country whom both Roland and Bradamante’s elder brother Renaud – whom both are part of the Twelve Peers – had fallen in love with. It is said that it has the power to nullify any and all Magecraft. It has been arranged so that Bradamante would possess this ring because of a hapless fate, and she greatly applied the ring’s powers at the time of extricating her lover Rogero from the evil mage Atlantes.  
  
The reason why the rank in Bradamante’s Magical Resistance Skill – which should originally be around Rank C – is being changed to Rank A and why the Magic Cancellation Skill is being endowed to her is because of this Noble Phantasm’s effect. Upon releasing its True Name, it flips up Bradamante’s as well as her whole party’s defensive power towards Magecraft. It is also primarily endowed with the power to “conceal one’s figure”. From the way it seems, on the occasion of this current materialization, Bradamante is charging the Magical Energy of this ring into her spear she holds in her right hand, raising her combat power against magical entities.

## Pronouns  
  
First Person Pronouns: watashi / Bradamante  
Second Person Pronouns: anata / ○○-sama / kisama  
Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / ○○-sama  
  
## Personality  
  
A knight who does not give up. Bradamante is strong in both mind and body. If it is for the sake of realizing her feelings, she will face anything and everything, no matter the number of times she must do so. She does not approve of coming to grips with misfortune as misfortune. A pure-hearted girl knight who always tries to have faith in justice and aims to do good even when in a predicament.  
  
Bradamante never yields before any hardship, and when she thinks of how to deal with them, she will always carry it out sooner or later. It is a work that can be done with her unwavering emotional strength… but occasionally, even a complaint briefly escapes from her mouth.  
  
Bradamante hates mages because she suffered unpleasant things from them during her lifetime. However, she excludes Merlin from them. As a matter of fact, she has a connection with the Grand Mage Merlin, and in her adventures when she was alive, Bradamante has been receiving advice from him through his priestess. As far as Bradamante is concerned, Merlin is a subject of reverence.  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
Bradamante recognizes the Master as someone with a connection to Merlin, and even though she knows that they are a mage, she will not hate them or do other things such as that. On the contrary, from the way it seems, she even thinks that Merlin’s return to the present is within the capacity of the Grand Mage.  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
“Bradamante, one of Charlemagne’s Twelve Peers. On behalf of the Great King Charlemagne, I will become justice!”  
  
“Let’s go, Master! Chivalry is surely something that needs to be diligently tempered!”  
  
“Paladins can’t be defeated! There’s only victory!”  
  
“Ouch!… Lord Merlin, Bradamante won’t give up. I’ll do my best!”  
  
## Historical Character and Figure  
  
One of Charlemagne’s Twelve Peers. A pure-hearted girl knight. The Knight of the White Wings. Bradamante was born as the daughter of Duke Aymon of the House of Clermont and Aya, the King’s younger sister, and she has an elder brother, the swordsman Renaud, who owns the magic sword Froberge and is one of the Twelve Peers just like her. Similar to her elder brother, she is known far and wide as a brilliant swordswoman. It is said that at the time when Charlemagne’s army was caught in a dilemma during their battle against the Great King Agramante, Bradamante herself personally served as the army’s rearguard and proceeded to engage in a magnificent duel with the enemy general Rodomonte, the King of Algiers.  
  
Before long, Bradamante falls in love with the knight Rogero, the leader of an enemy nation and a descendant of the Hero Hector, and for the sake of having this love fulfilled, she fought against many hardships. Even when he was abducted by an evil mage; even when he was swayed by a witch; even when a Greek prince came to propose marriage to her – Bradamante did not give up each time by any means and continued to face them all.  
  
◆  
  
For the Bradamante who materialized as a Servant, it is possible to say that Rogero makes her very identity as “a Heroic Spirit who continues to run after a radiance.” So long as she is the “tale” named ‘Bradamante’, it is assured that she will continue to search and pursue the “hope” named ‘Rogero’. That is to say, she will never, not even once, reach a happy ending like when she was alive————for she is surely someone who has been defined as “a tale of an eternal quest”…  
  
“Of course, I’m a bit sad! But I’m a Holy Knight before all of that, so that’s why I’ll do my very best with all my energy for the sake of taking back our world!”  
“Hey, that’s what’s good about you. I’m directly addressing you in your mind by the way.”  
“Lord Merlin!”  
  
## Standard Weapons  
  
Bradamante’s armaments are a shield – which is her Noble Phantasm – and a one-handed spear. She regards combat techniques that combine shield and spear as her forte. She is not the type of Lancer who would stake everything on her spear. It seems noteworthy that shield-and-spear users are sorted into the Lancer Class.

## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
Bradamante is named as one of Charlemagne’s Twelve Peers, and given that I did not know who Charlemagne was until I got the order to design Bradamante, I searched up all sorts of things about them to come up with Bradamante’s design. The rough design I submitted in the beginning was her with fairly simple clothes, and because ‘wings’ was the motif of her design, the wings at the front of her rough design was emphasized. But I have made Bradamante’s design brighter and more feminine as well with the wings motif also being smaller in its emphasis, and then having drawn a good backside for her, I settled down with her current design. I am personally pleased with the design of her magic shield Noble Phantasm. (saitom)
