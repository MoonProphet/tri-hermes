## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: B**

Nullifies magecraft activated with a three-verse chant or less. It will be difficult to harm her even with Greater Magecraft or Rituals.

## Personal Skills

**Summer Incarnated Elemental: A+**

Transforming her Spiritron Origin into a swimsuit has no bearing on her incarnated Elemental state, but it has slightly optimized her for the summer. Her magic energy absorption efficiency increases when drawn from summer-related environments, such as water from a lake summer spot or dazzling sunlight. This method may seem unbecoming of a blood-feeder, but Yu herself doesn’t seem bothered by it.  
Her preferences have not changed at all, so you might see her out sunbathing all the while complaining about the heat.

**The Conqueror’s Consort: EX**

This is a skill she reacquired after having reunited with Xiang Yu at Chaldea. It defines her position as the Hegemon-King of Western Chu’s wife/lover, as well as signifies the strong bond they share.  
Changing into a swimsuit has garnered more unwelcomed attention from others, to which Yu responds with an even stronger assertion: “I am this man’s wife!” In a sense, this may perhaps be a manifestation of her faithfulness.  

**Dance From the Bygone Days: EX**

This skill represents the sword dance she once performed before Xiang Yu. While she is firm with her distaste for human culture and sees no point in imitating them, she would occasionally bend that mindset for her beloved.  
She can’t tell if she’s objectively decent at it. She doesn’t give a damn about how others evaluate her for it. What she does know is that dancing was, at times, necessary. Xiang Yu’s evaluation of her dance and the look on his face as he watched her were between the two of them. That moment, along with this skill, was deeply engraved into her Spirit Origin as a precious memory.  
This skill was designed to be sealed and unusable without Xiang Yu nearby. But this time around, the impact of his spear being loaned to her has broken the seal and made it usable through the spear functioning as Xiang Yu’s substitute of some sort.   
It has now been arranged to be a spear dance.

## Noble Phantasm

# Anti-Fling Rondo (The Spear Dance to End Summer Monsters)

- Rank: A  
- Classification: Anti-Army NP 
- Range: 1-10 
- Maximum Number of Targets: 20

Anti-Fling Rondo.
Fling is slang for “affair” or “one-summer love,” and by extension points to the summer monsters mentioned in the event. The spear Xiang Yu loaned to her, (or as she believes to be) the embodiment of his love, serves as an anti-summer monster measure. It packs an anti-male attack bonus stemming from her over-the-top prejudiced view.  
Although Yu had no experience in martial arts or tactics, her love for Xiang Yu turning up a notch was what evoked the memories of the sword dance she once performed before him. This then gave her the idea of rearranging the choreography into a spear dance. For some reason, this Noble Phantasm turned out to resemble pole dancing.  
It works in the same way as her original Noble Phantasm “Eternal Lament” in that she lets her magical energy run amok to generate abnormal weather as she destroys her physical form. What makes it different, however, is the use of Xiang Yu’s spear as the axis of her movements: Gaining a spinning trajectory generates a tornado-shaped curse instead of a rain of blood.  
Her eternal lament has transformed into a rondo of death.  

## Character

### Pronouns

- First-person pronoun: watashi
- Second-person pronoun: omae/kisama/anata (when referring to certain characters such as Xiang Yu)
- Third-person pronoun: aitsu/yatsu/Master

### Personality

She’s not much different than usual, except that she is feeling slightly giddier after Xiang Yu loaned her his spear. And because she feels a stronger bond with him than ever, while she still hates humanity as a whole, her mercilessness particularly towards flirts who make advances on her has gone up a notch. Death to flirts.  
[Her Noble Phantasm] activates on those (she accuses of) making eye at her even if they never did hit on her.   
Simply put, expect the possibility of a spear flying your way just by catching a glimpse of her swimsuit form. “Well, what can I say? Anything to remain faithful to my Lord Xiang Yu,” she retorts.  

## Attitude towards Master

She’s not much different than usual, except that she’s even more head over heels for Xiang Yu.

### Dialogue Examples

* “I'll have you know I didn’t prepare this attire for you or some other rando. Lord Xiang Yu wanted me to enjoy this summer to the fullest, and that’s my sole reason for doing so. Anyone who dares to get in my way justly deserves eradication by this spear serving as his proxy. Consider yourself warned because I won’t be repeating myself.”
* “Summer monsters, as in flirts? Uncontrollable excitement and getting carried away, perhaps? If so, Lord Xiang Yu was worried that I might find myself in trouble with such threats...showing how much he cherishes me… Hehe. Hehehehe...”
* “Imaginary Lord Xiang Yu deployment complete. Spear dance simulation, start! Ohh, I see Lord Xiang Yu nodding in approval. And is that…a s-smile I see!? —-I’m…I’m one lucky woman!”
* “What, are you planning to stay here forever or something? Time to reunite with Lord Xiang Yu. Now come on, start packing!”

### Character in FGO

This version of Consort Yu was one of the Servants featured in the 2020 summer event “Servant Summer Camp ~Chaldea’s Thriller Night~.”  

She was all set and ready to head to the Singularity for a vacation with Xiang Yu post-mission. Unfortunately,  Xiang Yu’s calculations led him to the conclusion that, even if he must deceive her, it would be best she Rayshift without him. Shaken, her pillar of support in all this was the spear Xiang Yu loaned to her beforehand as well as the love it emanated.  
After all, he did warn her about the dangers of summer monsters.  
Yu found herself wondering what the so-called “summer monsters” are, later on finding out that the term is sometimes used to refer to the tendency of getting carried away and being prone to making mistakes such as hookups during the summer. “In other words, Lord Xiang Yu was worried I’d get hit on, so he gave this to me as protection!?” The love she felt has her at a fever pitch.  

(The truth remains unknown… Xiang Yu’s calculations did initially inform him of the “presence of threat/s” and the “possibility of said threat/s being monsters,” but he may have phrased it as such simply because it was summertime, not necessarily aware of the definition of the slang.)  

While she was utterly dejected that Xiang Yu was not around, she did not dwell on it completely. Using his love as her driving force, she was set on clearing this Singularity ASAP so that the two of them can finally go on a leisurely vacation together… Thus Yu commandingly led her unreliable Kouhai by the hand.  

She ended up dying multiple times.  
Again and again and again as if on a spree.  
She even split herself in two like a planaria.  
From the very start of this event, in fact.  

——That summer may have been Consort Yu’s summer.

**Xiang Yu**

Of course, I love my Lord Xiang Yu.   
If I may, what do you think…of this swimsuit…?  

**Prince of Lan Ling**

Is that your summer attire? Not bad at all.  

**Beni-Enma**

Enma, why not cut loose a little yourself?  
…I figured you’d say that. After all, you would hate it more if we had no place to enjoy ourselves. I swear, you’re conscientious to a fault.  

**Sessyoin Kiara**

\*smug\*  
You lost…to LOVE!  

**Xu Fu**

Honestly, I don’t know where to begin with you.  
All right. First off, will you stop addressing me as Lady Yu?  

## Comment from the Illustrator 

The offer I got came with the suggestion of basing her design around the color white, and from there it didn’t take much time to settle with a white cape and twin tails. Although I do recall having a hard time with her sprite since I stink at drawing standing poses… Her expressions, on the other hand, were easy to draw as I had her character down pat. (toi8)
