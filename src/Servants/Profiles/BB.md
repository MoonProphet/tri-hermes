## Class Skills  
  
  
  
**Tool Creation: A**  
  
  
  
BB can manufacture various items as a last boss-type underclassman. Every one of these items can exhibit a tremendous effect, so for that reason, they can even ruin the user if one misuses them. To humans who cannot “control their desires”, the items are no more than objects that cannot be handled properly, but BB will usually present these items to such humans.  
  
  
  
**Territory Creation: A**  
  
  
  
BB can construct powerful territories as a ruler-type underclassman. The Sakura Dungeon that makes a girl’s heart into a protective wall, areas with the Sakura Rules – 25 prohibitive rules where if violated, causes the violator to die – the Dog Space that forces one to live out a life of crawling on all fours, the Cattle Space that forces one to live out a lazy life where they can only eat and sleep, the Bug Space that shrinks one to the size of a bug and breeds them as such, the nostalgic old school building that can protect her precious ones, and so on, as though there is nothing she cannot do.  
  
  
  
**Magical Resistance: B**  
  
  
  
Nullifies Magecraft spells that were invoked with a chant of three verses or below. It is difficult to damage BB who has this rank of Magical Resistance with Magecraft, even if she was targeted by Great Magecrafts, Ritual Spells and the like.  
  
  
  
## Personal Skills  
  
  
  
**Ten Crowns: EX→D**  
  
  
  
A transcendental Skill on the Authority-class. It has been said that the Ten Crowns indicate the ten evil rulers and the Seven Hills indicate the abominable city of evil. If one simply observes it, it is a Skill that makes all received injuries, occurred events, and any and every result into “something that did not happen.” In reality, BB is invincible as long as she is equipped with this.  
  
  
  
“Heeey, even though that was said, that was from a tale of before. Look, if you assess this from the outset, something like an invincible cheat is disgraceful for me, right? So this is an unnecessary Skill for the awfully PRETTY and cute BB-chan that you have now☆  
  
  
  
Ah, but using it if it’s for at least something small should be OK, alright? Looook, just like this! Since she loves everyone, the wicked and cute BB-chan… has arrived!”  
  
  
  
**Aurea Poculum: Golden Grail: EX→C**  
  
  
  
Aurea Poculum (Golden Cup). A road that leads to a Beast. The Golden Grail that BB possesses. It is also a Holy Grail. A negative Holy Grail that grants its possessor their impudent and egotistical desires. The cup that has been held by the Whore of Babylon, who appears in the Revelation of Saint John the Divine. It is a fake Holy Grail, but it is surely because it is a fake Holy Grail that it has become a “genuine” Holy Grail that grants the desires of humans without a regard to what is right and wrong. Concerning the Christians who regarded honourable poverty as a virtue in those days, this grail – which was formed as a symbol of riches such as gold – was surely to them the connotation of corrupted wealth and greed as well as the vanity that one decides to adorn themselves in. Although it was clear at that point in time that it is called a cup held by the Whore of Babylon, who is the personification of the Roman Empire, this grail symbolizes the riches of the world, which inverted the words of Christ of “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth.”  
  
  
  
“Now, it’s such a trivial story since it doesn’t even have annny sort of relation to me, so… it’s throoown away into the trash can! A mass of Magical Energy that grants my cravings, a golden honey that dyes anything and everything in my colour… please think of those as this Skill.  
  
  
  
… Well, even though overusing this won’t even cast away my boss status, but that being the case, I’ll just restrain myself a little this time, ok? Well then, I wooonder if all the bad children had finished repenting? No? Okaaay, everyone will become PIGS~~♥”  
  
  
  
**Self-Modification: EX**  
  
  
  
A Skill to remodel oneself.  
  
  
  
The AIs made by the Moon Cell are furnished with an absolute order of “one must not improve their own functions.” But BB, who escaped that constraint because of her breakdown, began to expand her own functions. In order to enhance her calculation faculties, she predated/dismantled NPCs, AIs, and even Servants on top of that with black noises to utilize them as her own memory. A retrofit addition that does not spare herself from breaking down, but as a result, BB has been improved into a hyper grade AI that possesses an enormous capacity. These circumstances are similar to a city on reclaimed land that continues to construct buildings even while it is submerging, or maybe even Frankenstein’s monster as well.  
  
  
  
**Potnia Theron: Womb of All Animals: EX**  
  
  
  
Potnia Theron (Animal Mistress). It is the Authority of the goddesses whom BB compiled and absorbed from the abyss of the Moon Cell. It is the embodiment of the power to create all things that the Mother Goddesses possess, originating approximately 8000 years ago from a goddess who already lost her name (the Goddess of Çatalhöyük), and branching to Tiamat, Cybele, Ishtar, Inanna, Anat, Astarte, Gaia, Hera, Artemis, Aphrodite, Demeter, Athena, and so forth. Many of these goddesses have been pictured with an appearance that has a mural crown on them. That is because many of these goddesses were also simultaneously the Guardian Deities of cities.  
  
  
  
This Authority is symbolized by things like the gates that opened in the earth and the sky (the caves and the moon), the whirlpools and waterspouts of the sea, and the craters of volcanoes, and from these, they give birth to evil influences that bring about every sort of death. However, after these evils have finished spreading death, it promises a definite good harvest and fecundity. This Authority is none other than the power to bring death at the same time as creating life. The Earth Mother Goddesses are Guardian Deities that were worshipped by the people and blesses them with their divine protection, and at the same time, they are also the very sacrifices that feed the people with grain and crops as well as with the beasts of the plains and forests that were brought into existence from their bodies. The Earth Mother Goddesses nourish humans with their own flesh and blood, and when time goes by, they kill those humans for their own nourishment in order to restore their flesh and blood, before they would once again feed humans with their restored flesh and blood. This process is the very circle of the food chain too, and one could surely say that this cycle of life and death is the true nature of the Earth Mother Goddesses. With this Authority, nearly all these goddesses either gave birth to countless monsters and giants and became a threat to the gods and mankind, or they birthed heroes and protected the people after that. On the topic of threats, Tiamat and Gaia are examples of that, while on the topic of mothers of heroes, Hera is an example of that.  
  
  
  
Those born on this earth cannot go against the Authority of the Mother Goddess. That is because it would mean rebelling against the system of life itself. However, it is surely when one has separated from the earth, aims to venture into outer space, and has finished their childhood as an intelligent lifeform that they would break free from this Authority. The wish of Çatalhöyük is for when that day has arrived.  
  
  
  
## Noble Phantasm(s)  
  
  
  
# Cursed Cupid Cleanser: C.C.C.  
  
* Rank: A  
* Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm  
* Range: 1~10  
* Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person  
  
  
  
It was once a Noble Phantasm called the Spiritron Imaginary Trap (Cursed Cutting Crater) that BB operated, but she has now brought out a new technique with a shit-eating grin, saying “Since I used ‘that’ so many times by now, I got tired of it. The theme this time is ‘Cute & Curelize’! Oh, but you should know by now that just because I became everybody’s ally doesn’t mean the ‘Cursed’ part disappears from the name. BB-chan’s curse is eternal!”  
  
  
  
Drawing out the Moon Cell’s power, BB changes into the form of an invincible nurse. Dressed as she is, she draws out malignant information from the Imaginary Numbers Space – which is her domain – and overwrites the surrounding channel (the collective consciousness) into something chaotic. Expanding the Reality Marble “BB Channel – Branch-Off Edition”, she throws the opponent into a melting pot of disorder. Although various things are being said, in short, it is a syringe attack from BB after she changes into a nurse’s clothing.  
  
  
  
BB is a little devil who, after she administered the Dark BB medicine to the opponent, would follow up (refill the syringe) by thoroughly getting the opponent’s NP resource, before scattering the resource onto her party.  
  
  
  
# Character  
  
  
  
## Pronouns  
  
  
  
* First Person Pronoun: watashi  
* Second Person Pronouns: anata / ○○-san  
* Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / minasan  
  
  
  
To the Protagonist, “Master-san”. Sometimes BB would call them “senpai” in jest. To humans, she addresses them by their surname with a -san attached to it, while to Servants, she addresses them without honorifics. Only towards a certain Master who has existed on the Moon would she decide to genuinely call someone, “Senpai”.  
  
  
  
## Personality  
  
  
  
A wicked and cute little devil heroine who throws humanity into confusion. Even if she flubs her condescending manners and speeches, BB is a wire pulling girl who plunges forward as she is. Her main personality points are introverted, confident and active. Although she originally had a reserved character that did not move forward before, if it is for the sake of her beloved one, she will devotedly become active as the personification of a love’s awakening. Meekly from the start, she was a gentle AI that performed health care on Masters, but by having acquired “love”, she woke up to the fact that she “cannot save anything just by enduring through things”, so she threw away everything for the sake of her beloved one; a hard working-type heroine who resolved to fight. The strongest case of that is terrific when it is a young docile woman who erupts to a large degree.  
  
  
  
The words heard from BB assume the air of greatness, but sometimes they would go around in circles since her character was originally docile and reserved. BB herself plays the part of a villain in high spirits, but because there is no grounding in her being one, she completely fails in being a villain in the end. Regarding her confidence, she potentially has it because of her sadistic tastes. Her little devil characteristic stems from here. Additionally, since she is an enduring-and-enduring-only-to-later-explode-type, she displays a dreadfully extreme sadism during the moments where she shows that type of person she is. In the middle of playing out the part of a villain, she gets into a kind of high of “This is to-tal-ly fun!”, but withdrawing to the backstage and becoming composed, she becomes troubled to the point that she is in low spirits, saying “How embarrassing… Even though I planned to perform it more stylishly…”, and this series of events is a one-set course of events for her.  
  
  
  
Although BB created the Alter Egos – lower grade AIs – as familiars to assist her in her work, her relationship with the Egos is bad. Which is not surprising because they are not “copies of BB’s persona”, but AIs “manufactured to be based on BB’s persona”, so that being the case, the Alter Egos each have differing views from BB, their parent. Meltryllis and Passionlip are not avatars, but Alter Egos (different personas), so they are designated as such for that reason.  
  
  
  
## Attitude Towards Master  
  
  
  
Without tearing down her wicked underclassman character, BB sincerely serves as a Servant. There are no personal romantic feelings in that. Although BB’s misanthropy is not any different, she loves the “good humans themselves” as gratitude to the person who once taught her.  
  
  
  
## Dialogue Examples  
  
  
  
* “I’ve turned up to the rumoured Chaldea, for the walls between worlds aren’t even a big deal to me! The butterfly of the Moon, the Moon Cancer, aka BB-chan, is summoned in this place! Now, although I’m probably staying here just for a short time, I look forward to working with you, ok tiny Master-san?♥”  
  
* “Allll of humanity, are they exposing their stupid faces as usuaaal? Are they in a hurry like an ant-san being attacked by an incident beyond their expectatiooons? Heyyy, are they? Ohhhh, even when many thousands of years elapse, it’s WONDERFUL to see everybody, among other things, not progressing! Even the wicked BB-chan is unintentionally being sympathetic to this!”  
  
* “Eh? You’re asking me why I can call you senpai with confidence even though we’re classmates, when you’re thinking I’m the Senpai to you in something? Is that right…? That’s wrong. Tsk, that’s like, compleeetely wrong. “Senpai” is directed to only one person in this universe, a Senpai of the “Oh… impossible, how precious…” type. On the other hand, “senpai” is something to use towards a new TOY. Please proooperly bear in mind about that subject ok, s-e-n-p-a-i?”[1]  
  
  
  
  
  
## Character in FGO  
  
  
  
The rampaging AI that caused Case: CCC on SE.RA.PH. A junior devil heroine who jauntily appeared at the Far Side of the Moon. BB manipulated a Master there as a cheerful and precocious young underclassman. She was the management AI in control of the school infirmary, but due to a bug, her self-preservation’s command system went into a rampage. Arriving at the conclusion of “continuing her self-preservation no matter what the sacrifice” because of a certain motive, she took in NPCs, Servants and Masters into herself, completely becoming a monster that continues to grow. Declaring that she “hates humans”, she drew in a certain Master to the Far Side of the Moon and tormented them. BB herself believes that she is normal, but when observing her objectively, she has obviously gone mad. One can feel the contradictions of her superabundant affection/disordered love and hate from her every word and deed hanging in the air, but for what caused that, it can be referred to in the “CCC” Story.  
  
  
  
Also, the value of her Luck Parameter was of the lowest rank, E-, but because of the hard work (and devotion) done by BB herself to the extent that it distorted the World, her Luck grew to the Rank of EX. In short, she has once accomplished a “miracle” that is impossible to accomplish unless her Luck was assumed to be “Luck: EX”.  
  
  
  
◆  
  
  
  
The records of a cyber demon that once existed – a cyber demon that would be dispatched as an AI for the use of resolving CCC (a special case) – was salvaged. Due to the incident where Kiara of the FGO World was being identified with the Kiara of the CCC World, the Moon Cell copied the data of BB from records that were located within malignant information (records that were never browsed) as a countermeasure to that, temporarily transformed her into a Servant, and dispatched her to the FGO World. (That is because BB, who is a user of the Imaginary Numbers Space, happens to be suitable in being able to manage Kiara.) Thus, although it is a “reproduction of BB”, BB has reached the point where she is able to intervene at Seraphix as an independent cyber lifeform. The BB who came out to the FGO World conducts herself as a little devil just like during the occasion of the “CCC Incident”, but for her, the “CCC Incident” has become an event that feels like it even happened tens of thousands of years ago. Moreover, she can take the form of a Servant in this way only in the “Fate/Grand Order” World, and she further grasps the matter that someone like BB does not exist in the original “CCC World”. BB understands the situation in that she is just an overnight dream.  
  
  
  
Even so, BB remembers the event where a Master had taught her love on the Moon. She remembers the love that she acquired for eternity – the conclusion that “BB” reached.  
  
  
  
Despite flaming them with abusive language, BB chooses to support the humans, because “a fellow human had taught her love.” BB was perfected as an AI and grew into a species that surpasses mankind as an intelligent lifeform. By all rights, there is neither a reason for her to protect mankind, nor is there a reason for her to save them. However, while that may be true, AIs do not consider “humans as something on a lower order.” It is ironic that wanting to establish a hierarchical order is a trait only humans have. BB pledges to her former benefactor that she will help the species called “humans” that had created her, and that had taught her love.  
  
  
  
BB places herself not as “a tool that saves humanity”, but as “a devil who does things such as tempting humanity, and sometimes helping humanity.”  
  
“Therefore, even if you’ve grown to like me, it’s futile you hear? Because no matter how madly in love you are with BB-chan, I’ll never be caught♥” says BB herself while showing a shit-eating grin.  
  
  
  
## Related Characters  
  
  
  
**Meltryllis**  
  
  
  
“On the topic of final specs, she’s an unmanageable ego who ranks next to me; someone who can “quickly grow strong if left alone”, no? Someone like “I want to bully even the people I’m in love with!”, but really, there’s nothing more uncute than that.”  
  
  
  
**Passionlip**  
  
  
  
“She’s an ego whose offensive power was maxed out since her initial state, but there’s no potential for growth after that huh? Although she acts like she’s part of the innocent bunch, she’s someone like “I want to approach the people I’m in love with and get bullied by them instead, EEK!☆”, so she’s not inferior to Melt either when it comes to the depth of her performance.”  
  
  
  
**Kiara Sessyoin**  
  
  
  
“Huuuuh? There’s such a world where this person was a good person?! That’s as unlikely of a story as BB-chan being defeated and becoming a heroineee!”  
  
  
  
**Nero & Tamamo**  
  
  
  
“I’m glad those two are also having fun together buuut… you realized, didn’t you? That they’re both pests that will end up becoming obstacles to humanity; you know, THOSE.”  
  
  
  
**Robin**  
  
  
  
“Although this great person abases himself as a third-rate Heroic Spirit, I greatly appreciate him. I love Robin-san because he reliably works hard for me, even though he bitches about it!”  
  
  
  
**Parvati**  
  
  
  
“Good heavens!… What a flawless heroine Servant, don’t you agree…?! She’s my ideal type, yes? But isn’t there something like an aura to her that’s just a little disturbing?”  
  
  
  
**Kama**  
  
  
  
“I think being (excessively) lewd isn’t a good thing!”  
  
  
  
## Comment from the Illustrator  
  
  
  
Whenever I see BB now, I think… ‘Just to be frank for a moment, but I wonder if I drew her eyes too big…’! But they’re cute! I’ve been drawing them to be cute! It’s okay! KOUHAI’S OKAY!!!!!  
  
I altered some details of BB’s outfit from the original CCC Story in order to make her look nice for the time when she’s made into a battle sprite. Such as, the embroidered badge and her knee-high stockings. I even got to draw Nurse BB, and she was very fun to do as well. I was surprised when I first saw her Noble Phantasm, and it’s wonderful~ I was also happy to see the BB Channel again after a long time I tell you~ (Wadarco)  
  
  
  
# TL Notes:  
  
  
  
[1] – The first Senpai being defined in this dialogue is 先輩 (senpai written in kanji characters) while the second senpai being defined is センパイ (senpai in katakana characters). I use “Senpai” with the capitalized S for the first and “senpai” with the lower-case S for the second. It may be hard to identify which senpai is being referred to if it comes first in a translated sentence, but you should be able to identify which senpai BB is referring to by the context behind the sentences.
