# Nitocris  
  
## Pharaoh Nitocris  
  
**Mash:**   
Hmm? What's that...?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Hmm...  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
This is some cheap wine. Its vulgar body, perhaps fearful at the honor of passing through my throat, pales and fades into nothingness.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
I will at least acknowledge its grace, if nothing else.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Hah hah hah, perhaps you're trying to say cold wine goes down well? You sure say things in a roundabout way!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is this a...party?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Look, Nitocris over there seems to be sober.  
She might be the most reasonable one here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's try to talk to her, Senpai.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Oh, Master, Mash. What's going on?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We just happened to be passing through.  
Um...what are you doing here?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
We're drinking, as you can see. What of it?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I was invited by the two pharaohs over there... Well, more like I volunteered myself to join them in their banquet.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But why here in the Command Room?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
If you're asking about the location, Pharaoh Iskandar said this place is fitting for a king's banquet.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
If you are inquiring about the purpose of this banquet...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Nitocris! What are you doing over there!?  
Drink. Empty your cup and drink some more.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
This is a gathering of pharaohs. That includes you.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
I called Cleopatra too, but she was so overwhelmed with feelings of gratitude and unworthiness that she passed out.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
So basically, you're the only person that can act as a representative for female pharaohs in Chaldea!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...With all due respect, that's how it is.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Now that you mention it, everyone here really does have the title of pharaoh.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Really?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Was Iskandar one too?  
  
  
---  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Oh? Master, Mash, I didn't realize you were there!  
Did the fragrance of the wine draw you here?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
It doesn't matter! As our mutual friends, you have permission to join us! Drink up!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Are you trying to cheapen this gathering of pharaohs? Besides, I recall they're at an age where they should avoid alcohol.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
...Oh, very well. You're hardly even a pharaoh to begin with, and I do not intend to lambaste them for their age.  
I shall permit it. Drink up!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Haha, you're quite strict. But I do have a proper regnal name: Setepenre Meryamun!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Is that so?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
I too am known by the name Setepenre.  
I'm sure it is a common name for pharaohs.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
The King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Usermaatre Setepenre... Son of Ra... Ramesses the Great... Amun's beloved...  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
That is who I, the Sun Ozymandias, am! I shall allow it. Sear that name into your Spirit Core and Spirit Origin! Remember it!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
By the gods! Then I suppose we're like brothers!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
No, we're not brothers. We're not, but...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I do believe the great king here is a pharaoh!  
...I think that is what Cleopatra would say.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Interesting. You dare go against my will?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
N-No, great pharaoh, I would not! I just thought of what Cleopatra would say and I could not help it...  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Well, it is true she might say something like that.  
When did you get that close with each other?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Please...forgive my indiscretion. My only lord is the Sun King, and my only alliance is with Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Cleopatra is like... a troublesome little sister.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Hah hah hah. Don't tease her so much, Sun King. Cleopatra would indeed say something like that.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
She was the last pharaoh on Earth.  
If so, she is like a granddaughter to us.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
True enough. Even if she's not related to us by blood, she was the last to inherit the title of pharaoh and its divinity.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Yes. But if that's the case&mdash;  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Nitocris. You. Yes, you.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Y-Yes?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
You're the oldest pharaoh among us.  
Wouldn't you be more of a mother figure, then?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Truly an incarnation of the ancient Horus.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I-I-I am a mother!?  
To Lord Ozymandias!?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Does that mean I can do whatever I want?  
A mother does all sorts of things for her son...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
She cooks for him, lets him sleep on her lap...  
Even tells old folktales and scary stories!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
W-Would you be okay with that?  
I've never had a child...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
N-Nitocris?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
N-N-No, I am not worthy!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Yes, that is too much. And Iskandar&ndash;you are a pharaoh who has accomplished more than I have.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
You are the King of Conquerors. You traveled far and wide, seizing many lands. I pale in comparison.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
What's so great about a king who focused so much on expansion and left nothing but destruction in his wake?  
I am a god. I am the sun. I am the true pharaoh.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Pharaoh Ozymandias!  
That is so obvious I need not say it!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
You are the king of kings: the god-king.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
You are so revered that I dare not even try to compare you with others. It would be far too presumptuous of me.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...The same goes for Pharaoh Cleopatra. I didn't try as earnestly to protect the country as she did.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Didn't Cleopatra...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She destroyed the country, right?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
If you speak of destruction, the decline of Upper and Lower Egypt became inevitable as soon as I, the true pharaoh, was gone.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Any reign other than my own would thereafter be imperfect, no matter who the pharaoh was.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Just as the Nile flows, the final destination was inevitable. I never had my hopes up.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Hah hah hah. I feel I've said this before, but no country escapes downfall. Not even my Macedonia.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Yes. If countries are destined to fall, then all things considered, I believe she played her part of pharaoh well.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
But I...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She seems kind of sad.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nitocris...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai. I agree.  
She seems depressed.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
For some reason she doesn't look like she's touched her wine.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...I guess you can tell.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I'm... an inexperienced pharaoh.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
When I see all these great pharaohs here...  
When I subject myself to their gaze...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I feel depressed...  
N-No, more like ashamed.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But Iskandar said that you're the oldest pharaoh in Chaldea, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In other words, you were alive in the Age of Gods.  
You're a pharaoh from the ancient times...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
You think in terms of your magecraft.  
The older and greater Mystics possess more power.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
But to me, time means nothing.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
It's about how a pharaoh&ndash;the child of a god, a godlike king, a god incarnate&ndash;should be.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...I don't know why I'm a Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Do you know why I was not taken to the eternal afterlife?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Ozymandias never chose it to begin with, but me...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Me... I'm sure I just never made it there.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Fujimaru, my ally... maybe I should talk to you about this.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I am a foolish pharaoh. I closed off my own path to the afterlife.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I took my own life without preparing for what lay beyond. But I have no regrets.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I turned into a weapon for the sake of my brothers...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...Those treacherous retainers who used pharaohs like puppets... Those fools who mocked the position of pharaoh...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I sent them all to the bottom of the Nile... Without mercy, without hesitation, and without regret.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you got your revenge.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So that means... you killed them.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Yes, I slaughtered them with my own hands.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Perish, you foul creatures!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
No one will hear your screams, your groans, or your cries for help!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I will kill you all! You should be happy to be embraced by the waters of the Nile as you die!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
You used my brothers as puppets...  
You murdered them all...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I will never forgive you. You shall never be forgiven! Never! Never! I've been waiting for this day...!  
  
   
**Retainers:**   
Why, Nitocris? We were the ones who helped you become pharaoh!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
It was for this day. Everything. Everything I've done was to kill you all.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
That has been my only reason for living.  
Just so that you would choose me as your next puppet...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I made you think you could control my dignity, my being, my body, my will.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
And you fell right into my trap. When you heard I had a gift for you, what did you think it was?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
A lavish banquet? A treasure of gold? Or maybe&mdash;Oh, you thought you could even have me?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
But this is the end. I will end it all for you.  
The hubris of trying to control a pharaoh... It stops here!  
  
   
**Retainers:**   
Stop it! No! We don't want to die!  
Save us...!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Make your pleas to my dear brothers!  
To the ones you killed without any mercy!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
You will not travel to the eternal afterlife. Ha, ha, but rest assured. I am the same. I will follow you soon.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I will find you in death and torment you for eternity!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I killed them... and then myself.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...After putting up with so much, I'd finally taken my revenge.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Come to think of it, maybe I'm so short-tempered as a Heroic Spirit because of my deeds in life.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I am a puppet of a pharaoh.  
At best, all I ever accomplished was revenge.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
That's why I've tried to be as proper as possible.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I punished them for their impiety in attempting to control the position of pharaoh. I tried to restore honor to the pharaoh name.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
The pride I have as pharaoh does exist within my heart, but even still...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
If I compare myself to the other pharaohs, I shiver just thinking how small I am...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I'm so pathetic... I can't even bring myself to face them...!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Hey, small one.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Let's see. How's this? (Beep, beep.) There.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Difficulty setting? Oooh... “Sparta Mode.” That's got a nice ring to it. Must mean it's as strong as them.  
That settles it, then...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Iskandar? What are you doing in front of that console...?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? Hey! Helloooo?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The training program just activated.  
Are you guys doing something?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Of course we are! The wine has warmed our bodies. How about we swing our swords for a little entertainment!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
By the way, I'll be assisting the enemy.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
I am tired of all the cheap wine.  
It might be fun to play along with you!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Rejoice, pretenders! Rather than eradicating you, I will shine from on high.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Even those who are not truly alive weep tears of joy. Sear the light of the pharaoh into you!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
I see. That puts Master with Mash and Nitocris.  
A good team.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
When did we say we were all joining in!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I don't really get what's going on there, but am I right in assuming there's going to be a fight in the simulator?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, just don't get hurt, okay?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I... I have to fight a proper pharaoh?  
That would just be too disrespectful...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
I won't forgive desertion.  
If you run, you will face the consequences.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
What do you think, Sun King?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Escape and defeat are not fit for the divinity of the pharaohs! Thus...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
That's right. If you run, you must renounce the title of pharaoh.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Never address yourself that way. Never use the name. And...let's see... Say you're sorry for being a pharaoh up until now.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I-I can't...do that...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I am a pharaoh, no matter how short my reign was!  
I just can't renounce that fact!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Then you must fight. I don't have to say this, but you'll face the same consequences if you lose. It'd also be boring if you threw the game.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
On the contrary, if you win... we'll give you some sort of reward.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
You speak too much, King of Conquerors.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Nitocris, even after receiving my endless splendor, will your mirror still reflect darkness, or won't it?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
If you're a pharaoh, then withstand it! If you can't, you will fade away. That's all there is to it!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like...we have no choice but to fight!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Fujimaru! My ally!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I'm an inexperienced pharaoh.  
But the fact that I am still a pharaoh is my pride.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
If I'm going to lose that, then I can't afford to run or lose!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I must win this fight no matter what! Lend me your power! No, PLEASE lend me your power!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Nitocris:**   
(Panting)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That was intense!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Y-You guys won. You won against three pharaohs that symbolize an era!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Heh, heh... Ha, ha, ha! We lost! We lost!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
I had no intention of holding back. Perhaps that cheap wine and my arrogance came back to bite me.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Why are you all...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Cleopatra's here too. When did she join the battle!?)  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
That's not the face a winner should make.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
I did not hold back. Your determination was just greater than ours.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Listen up. You fought and defeated multiple pharaohs&mdash;myself included.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
O Queen of the Mirror who lived in the ancient world... You're a perfect pharaoh in your own right.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
I tell you this on my honor.  
You should be thankful for this reward.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
That's right, Queen Nitocris.  
I witnessed it myself. It's just as you said.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I saw your pride as a pharaoh...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Cleopatra...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
(Huh...? How long have you been here?)  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
That's something I lack, to say the least.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
In that respect, I think you're a better pharaoh than I am. There's nothing to be ashamed of.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
A better pharaoh!? Such a useless distinction!  
Just being a pharaoh is enough!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
It's pure arrogance to wish for any more than that.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
After all, it's established fact that I am the best and most venerable pharaoh. Anything more is fighting for scraps!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
You could be known only for your dark, vengeful acts... or for your numerous conquests... You could be the last of your kind...  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
You could even be a young pharaoh who only reigned for a few days...  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
No matter what kind of pharaoh you are, to me, there is very little difference!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
But that is why I understand your admiration towards me. It may be arrogant, but I do understand.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Humans still extend their arms to the sun, even knowing they can't reach it. They attempt to touch the gods.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
There is nothing as meaningless as hanging your head in despair because you cannot reach me. That would be true arrogance.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Hey, you. You just counted me as a pharaoh, didn't you? It feels like I finally got my certificate of authenticity or something.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
...Hah hah! This is some cheap wine! I'm not thinking properly, but my mouth keeps going!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Let's go somewhere else and keep drinking, Rider.  
This time get me some wine that will at least let me talk properly!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
You're a Rider too, you know? We can keep drinking, but there's not much in the way of wine around here...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Oh, but I do know a king with a big attitude whose wine happens to be very good.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
All he'd need to do is fetch some more from the storeroom... I wonder where he is?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He left...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...Were the pharaohs... trying to...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...tell me that...all along?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I was a fool who, unable to make it to the eternal afterlife, eventually became a Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I thought it was a punishment by the gods, but...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
But then I met Ozymandias and the other pharaohs. And not just them&ndash; I met you too. The best ally I could ever have.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
This isn't a punishment. It's...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...No, never mind.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I was just blurting out nonsense. It was just my imagination. Let's just forget it. Forget it!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I know I'm not really good at taking hints, but let me say this.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Since you guys fought at full force, the simulator's all messed up! It's...pretty tough to clean it up, you know...?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just let us do it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Us two will do it.

Wherever you'd like.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**

Of course.

**Mash:**

**Mash:**   
Doctor, you are listening, right?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I see. So when you said you two would do it, you were talking about me as well...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hah... The pharaohs sure do everything on a grand scale... including affecting the simulator system... (Sigh)
