# Quetzalcoatl  
  
## The Flaming Luchadora and the Three Deathmatches  
  
**Mash:**   
Excuse me, Senpai!  
I just heard a loud sound!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Buenos días, Mash! ¿Que pasó?  
You look so frightened, yes!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um...nothing...  
I should actually be asking you that...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Wait a minute! Senpai and Quetzalcoatl are entangled in a very questionable position!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Quetzalcoatl's legs are wrapped around Senpai's head... Wh-what is going on!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What do you mean?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You see...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
This is a lesson, yes!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
This is called an Huracarrana! It is a move where a wrestler cradles the opponent's head with their thighs and flips around using their momentum...  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
The goal is to slam the opponent to the mat to get a fall. It's a very popular lucha libre move, yes!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
And there you have it!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yep...help!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I see. I think I understand the situation now!  
But please stop, Quetzalcoatl!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Should you actually use that move on Senpai,  
[♂ he /♀️ she} will be seeing stars for the rest of the day!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
No problema!  
I've taught Fujimaru the basics of breaking a fall!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
[♂ He /♀️ She} is likely to bounce off the ring after hitting the mat, but it should be okay as long as [♂ he /♀️ she} grabs the rope at the right moment!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hahaha, that's impossible, no!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm about to lose consciousness already, yes!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, please stop, Quetzalcoatl!  
Senpai seems to be trying to talk!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
...I didn't realize.  
Lo siento, Master...  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
When I heard that preparations for battle were complete, I thought that meant it was time for a match! Soy una mala diosa...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Another second and I'd have fallen into Kur!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I wasn't as careful with my words as I should have been...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Quetzalcoatl looks a bit down...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You just told her the simulator was ready, right, Senpai?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But didn't you have a match recently, Quetzalcoatl?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I thought you said seeing Medb's flying kicks made you want to face off with a striker...  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
She has some nice moves, but the moment it turns into close combat, is not so flashy, no...  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
It's basically judo. Once you get caught in a grapple, you can't get away...  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
...But she's not so strong, so I can just toss her around after I slip her hold without even trying...  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
And that's no fun...  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
I want an aerial throw that sends someone flying, yes! I want lucha that excites an audience! ¡Muy emocionante!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
(Sigh)... I want to fight more! I want to use my wrestling moves on others, and to have them use wrestling moves on me, yes!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I understand. But I'd rather you not crush Senpai's spine or ribs...  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Of course not. I will handle Master as gently as an egg! I haven't hurt you yet, have I?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're right...it doesn't hurt that much!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wait... What do you mean “yet”?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Eh...? Did it hurt? Lo siento...  
Maybe I overdid it...yes...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Quetzalcoatl, I think you need to get a better feel for your own strength.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You are definitely more intellectual and dependable than the other goddess Servants...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But you also seem to be a lot more...human...  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
¡Ah, entendida!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Teehee, naughty Mash. You don't like that I'm taking up so much of Master's time!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Then let's practice lucha moves on Master together!   
¡Será divertido!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I... That's not what I meant! But...let's stop doing wrestling moves on Senpai entirely...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But now that you mention it, I have an idea.  
Give me some time to prepare. Please stay there...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Actually, please keep your distance from Master! I've rung the bell! The match is over! Do you hear it!?  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
¡Que linda! She's in such a hurry for me!  
Mash is always so energetic!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
I do not know what she is going to do, no, but I bet it is safe to say I should look forward to it, sí, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yep. That's what makes Mash great.  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Yes, yes! She puts so much effort into things she does for other people, rather than her own desires. That is the mark of a great person!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Sometimes it may be in vain, and it may even be a weakness occasionally, but that is exactly the sort of thing we have been hoping for all this time.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're cute too, Quetz.  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Th-that is a sudden change of subject!  
You're making big sister blush, yes!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
I'm used to being called beautiful, but cute...  
Well, that tickles me a little!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
So, this is where Mash wanted us to go.  
Let's see what she has planned.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
So my opponent has finally come.  
I'd say she's in the heavyweight class, perhaps?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Eh? What's going on?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I asked for her help.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Since Quetzalcoatl is so frustrated, I arranged for her to fight three martial artists here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It will be a mixed martial arts match,  
and while I couldn't prepare a proper ring...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm sure these matches will satisfy her.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As presumptuous as it is, I, Mash Kyrielight,  
shall be the referee for the matches.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
I see. So Señorita Martha is going to be my first opponent.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
I can see that her Spirit Origin is sturdy like iron, yes! I won't need to hold back at all! And a saintly wrestler is such a great personaje!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I am honored to hear that you consider me a formidable opponent.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I may possess the great Jacob's fists, but there is definitely still room for me to grow.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I'd like to see how my fists match up against the great Mayan goddess in this match.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Oooh, she is up to the challenge, yes...  
Are you perhaps a ruda, Martha...?  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Well, everything is fine as long as we have fun,  
yes? I am confident I can take a hit myself!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Please don't hold back, Martha.  
Let us both go all-out.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
By the way, I will serve as commentator.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
Whose moves will reign supreme...? Will it be fists or twists? These questions have always intrigued me, and have been my life's pursuit for so long now.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Oh, the professor who's been holed up in the warehouse, yes? A commentator! Mash thought of everything!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
But I'm sorry...I've sealed away my llave moves. After all, jumping moves are what makes Lucha Libre so great.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Are you saying you're not even going to use your signature move? You're not taking me very seriously, are you?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Fine. I won’t hold back! I'll even use my Tarasque. And if I throw you out, I can use weapons, right?  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
I'm still quite new as far as learning all the other Servants' quirks, but is Miss Martha always like this?  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
For a Ruler, she doesn't seem to be all that concerned with the rules.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
No, no, ringside battles are a highlight of lucha!  
I knew Martha was a ruda!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
But don't you worry, Master.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
I may not have a shell, but I have wings. No matter who my común is, I won't go down easy, no!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Holmes:**   
This has turned into quite the intense brawl.  
Miss Martha seems to have landed more punches.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
And they are no mere jabs. Any ordinary Servant would have gone down in short order.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
One might say that while she has a rather slender Spirit Origin, she hides the power of a freight train in those arms of hers.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
And what stamina! Even the rhythm of her breathing sounds like the roaring of a dynamo!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But Quetzalcoatl isn't backing down either.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Right you are. Ah, take a look.  
Miss Martha is finally getting in position.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
All that pounding and I still haven't been able to bring this to an end. Time to use my trump card!  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
That stance... She's readying the fist of justice, inverted thrust...Jacob's Perishing Fist.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jacob's Perishing Fist!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are you talking about, Holmes!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Quiet. The real battle starts now.  
It would be a shame to miss even a single second!  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
The Jacob's Limbs style is said to be able to defeat even an archangel. It's specialized for use against a target with Divinity...like Quetzalcoatl.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
And behold that stance, Fujimaru. She's putting everything into that strike, and so leaving herself wide open!  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
Should it hit head-on, there will be consequences.  
For both parties, that is.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
My stomach's going to be wide-open for you.  
In exchange&ndash;  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I'm going to shoot that jaw of yours all the way to Marseille!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
¡Olé! I've been waiting for that one hit!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...What!? It's not...working!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um...she took it straight on the chin...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
It's an evasive maneuver. The instant that fist touches her face, she turns her head to avoid injury.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
Of course, it's easier said than done, and it's not something just anyone can do. But, she's managed to pull of that miraculous feat!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
I will not knee your stomach, no! Rather, I'm going to take this extended arm of yours, yes!  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
What a perfect armlock.  
That should determine our victor here!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Why...you... Let go...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Tres! Dos! Uno! Ding ding ding!  
And the winner is: Quetzalcoatl!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
O Jacob, O Moses...I'm terribly sorry.  
I have suffered utter defeat...  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Martha, you were a wonderful opponent. Especially that last puñetazo...I thought I was going to pass out.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
I'm sure you wouldn't have stopped even if I kicked your stomach.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
You forced me to use the llave that I had originally sealed off.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I never imagined you wouldn't try to evade my fist. I'm not making excuses for myself, but I flinched a little.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
And that was the reason for your defeat!  
A luchadora does not even think of evading!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
A lucha match is all about lifting the opponent up. That's why I took your hit. You just didn't know that.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
If you had known, you would have continued into a clinch hold, yes?  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Had that happened, I don't know how the match would have gone.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...I see.  
Way to go. You completely defeated me.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
We may be from different worlds, but it's clear to me that you are a divine spirit of good. I've not a single ounce of resentment towards you.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Let's fight in a proper ring next time.  
I shall study up on lucha a bit more until then.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
¡De nada!  
I shall look forward to that time, yes!  
  
   
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Holmes:**   
Miss Quetzalcoatl took the first round. But will she be able to pull it off with her next opponent?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
It looks like it's my turn.  
Woo, woo!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Whoa, it's an all-black monster, yes! What happened? Did you stay out in the sun too long and get burnt?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Yeah, well, I've got my reasons. I'm really not supposed to reveal my True Name all willy-nilly.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Think of me as...uh, the man of two thousand faces or somethin'... How 'bout you just call me Dos Mil Máscaras?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um, you've got a bunch of things all jumbled up!  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
Course I do. I'm that kinda guy.  
I've even lost count of how many faces I have.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So, from the name, shouldn't you be wearing a mask or something?  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
Oh, I'm wearing a mask. You just can't see it because I'm silhouetted. You just don't get it, Master.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I figured he would be able to hold his ground even against Quetzalcoatl's aerial killer move.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And if we are to follow the tradition of Lucha Libre, we definitely need a rudo.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
I'd actually expected Jaguar to show up as our ruda...  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
But fine! Let's do this!  
That move you just showed, Señor Dos Mil Máscaras...  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy a stimulating aerial battle against you!  
  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
Well, this is what I was hired to do,  
so I won't disappoint!  
  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
But are you really okay with this?  
Shouldn't I be the worst sort of opponent for you?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe in terms of class affinity!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Yes. But what about it?  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Even if she's injured, a luchadora must project grace and power before her fans, yes!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
I won't go down easy, no matter what class you are! I'll prove that right now!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
And know that a luchadora is at her most terrifying on the brink of being knocked down!  
  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
Hah! Loving that confidence!  
Then I'll kick your ass, as requested!  
  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
Will you be able to keep up with my awesome moves?  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Holmes:**   
Hm. This has turned into quite the aerial battle,  
but it appears Dos Mil Máscaras has the upper hand.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are Quetzalcoatl's moves not working?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Her moves are pretty flashy and nothing else. An expert martial artist like Dos Mil Máscaras can evade her easily.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
On the other hand, he's definitely hurting Miss Quetzalcoatl with his moves.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
Seems he has studied Baritsu. His moves are nimble,  
and he's definitely hitting the vital spots.  
  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
(Hey, hey, hey...I'm hitting all the right spots!  
So why isn't this lady going down!?)  
  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
(Actually, that last move definitely hit her! But she just gets back up. But what's more important...)  
  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
(That's insane! Totally insane! The way the air bounces back up is surreal! Is she the Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King or what!?)  
  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
(She's like a giant mountain! If that muscle monster gets her hands on me, she'll crush my very soul to pieces, to say nothing of my Spirit Origin!)  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
You're looking nervous, Máscara. I'll take this opportunity to answer your question.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Your attacks are effective, efficient, and very painful, yes! But the pain is still tolerable.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Why? Because...!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
The limpio would never let the rudo's attacks defeat them, no! Instead, the more I get hit, the more fired up I get, yes!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
So brace yourself, yes! I'm going to use my ultimate attack: my Xiuhcoatl Driver&ndash;  
  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
Uh, I'd rather you not do that.  
I give up! I give up!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Does that mean you're throwing in the towel?  
  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
Yep. This is not worth getting turned into a greasy smear on the floor.  
  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
I kinda half-assed taking this job. If it was a life-and-death sort of fight, I'd have asked for a lot more money to do it.  
  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
So, you win, since you took everything I had without going down. You good with that, Miss Lucha?  
  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
If the opponent admits defeat, that's the end of the match. Isn't that the best bit of pro wrestling?  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
That is correct, yes!  
I feel like you and I will get along fine, yes!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
...So I am a little disappointed. If we ever get to meet again, I'd like to see the face behind your mask!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Because if you stick to being shy,  
you might just lose your heart. ¿Entendido?  
  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
Ha. Thanks for that warning.  
I'd...uh...rather not ever meet you again...  
  
   
**Dos Mil Máscaras:**   
But the world of lucha libre is pretty deep. Maybe it's time I took an interest in a different martial art...  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Whew. Both rounds were fun, yes!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
An orthodox fighter and a flying rudo. I very much enjoyed it. So who is my final opponent?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Sorry to make you wait.  
Your final opponent will be me, Mask de Baritsu.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I've never seen that Heroic Spirit...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okay, just how much is that mask getting passed around?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Ah, a masked wrestler is also one of the highlights of Lucha Libre! He will be quite a formidable end to this three-round match, yes!  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
My observations are complete. I can see that your body is positively riddled with wounds from the previous matches, and that you are running low on stamina.  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
While I am a gentleman who prefers to play fair, I am not always able to do so. I only engage in battle when I have a significant advantage over my opponent.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, THAT is a terrible thing to say...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Impressive, Baritsu Mask. That's smart.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
Indeed. By the way, my Baritsu is a well-rounded mix of strikes, throws, and holds. It's the ultimate self-defense martial art.  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
You have no chance of winning.  
Would you like to withdraw?  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Your concern is unnecessary, Baritsu Mask.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Fatigue and injury are everyday things for a luchadora! And actually, I'm in top condition right now, yes!  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
I was hoping for that response.  
Then let us begin our match, Miss Quetzalcoatl.  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
But...why are you and Master not calling me by my proper nom de guerre?  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
You're open, Baritsu!  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
Heh...do you really think so?  
(And why is she STILL not using my nom de guerre?)  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Guh...  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
I have targeted your arm now. Time to surrender. I regret to inform you that victory is now quite beyond your reach as matters stand.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
...Do you know why there are so many flashy moves in Lucha Libre?  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
No...I cannot say I have given it any thought. They are likely just inefficient skills meant for nothing so much as pure showmanship.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
No! They are for the audience, and for your opponent, with whom you share a deep mutual trust!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
If you are seeking efficiency in battle,  
then you should head to war!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
A battle without cheers or lights...a battlefield that is utterly lonely!  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
Cheers? Do those really matter for battle?  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Of course!  
That's why, Master, I ask you to cheer for me!

**Fujimaru 1:**   
¡Olé! Go, lucha master!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Mucho mucho! That has given me the strength of a hundred luchadoras! Hiyaaah!  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
(She jumped straight up to break my joint lock... What incredible pain tolerance. Or rather, is this the vaunted endurance that every wrestler possesses?)  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
This is no time to admire her moves!  
Ugh, I can't keep my balance! Or my mask!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Sorry. Any máscara that falls off so easily is no match for me!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
If you are a true wrestler, you need to be more fashion-conscious! And here we go...! La Mística!!!  
  
   
**D：Mask de Baritsu:**   
(What is this move...!?  
What is going on!?)  
  
   
**D：Mask de Baritsu:**   
(Spinning...am I spinning? Really?  
How are we spinning THIS much!?)  
  
   
**D：Mask de Baritsu:**   
(After six full spins, the inner ear simply goes haywire, and it becomes impossible to take an attack. And yet...we're still spinning?)  
  
   
**D：Mask de Baritsu:**   
(Are we in...space? I can see space...I don't recall...taking my medicines...this morning...)  
  
   
**D：Mask de Baritsu:**   
(There's no need for careful examination to know what's happening here! I'm doomed!)  
  
   
**D：Mask de Baritsu:**   
(Tap, tap)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Holmes has tapped out!  
Quetzalcoatl, please cancel your drop!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Quetzalcoatl is the winner!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Aw. Then there won't be a head-first drop, no...  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
...Whew. Cervical spine annihilation avoided.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Yes. You were spared because you tapped so early.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
You should be grateful that I am so precise in executing my moves, yes. For any other wrestler, we were beyond the point of no return!  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
Probably. I'm surprised I lived. I'm actually more frightened that you have the muscles to stop that move than the muscles needed to do it in the first place.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Of course. I told you. Luchadoras perform their moves with utmost consideration for their partners!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Stopping a move midway through is just common courtesy. But I suspect you could have fought more!  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
I had every intention of doing so. The spirit is willing, but the body...not so much.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What do you mean?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
The move was surreal. It was so intense, but at the same time, my heart was pounding with excitement.  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
Excited that the move was terrible...and intriguing at the same time. The moment I had that thought, my body tapped out quite of its own accord.  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
I have the confidence to meet any malevolent attack directly, but it appears my self-defense skills cannot handle moves made with kind intentions.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Heehee. You speak too highly of it.  
I just didn't have the strength to make it hurt.  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
I withdraw what I said about your moves being just for show. It reminds me of a Japanese sword form called kassatsuken, where one imbues their sword with life and death for their battle.  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
One permits their opponent to live, even after defeating them. I had always found this contradictory, but...I understand now.  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
Strength is not simply a matter of defeating your opponent.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Yes, your moves were also very strong, Baritsu Mask. But you seem to be very fragile. You need to eat better so your bones will be sturdy, yes!  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
I'll take your word for it.  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
...Your technique is a sort I would never employ, but I would still like to show my respect to you, who has so mastered lucha.  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
Adiós, Miss Quetzalcoatl. Should we have the opportunity, I would like to meet again.  
  
   
**Mask de Baritsu:**   
But...why will no one properly use my nom de guerre?  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Whew. So this is the end...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're all beat up...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Oh? Are you worried about me? No te preocupes.  
I'm feeling very good right now, yes.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
I have that pleasant sort of fatigue you get after hard work! Also the satisfaction that I was able to express myself to and understand others through lucha!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
And because I was able to experience that, I am here, smiling with you now.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
I can do that not as the goddess of war who takes life, but as a goddess of wisdom and fertility who looks toward the future.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yep. I know.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Got it. Let's do this again sometime.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
...Teehee. Gracias, Master.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Ahhh! I don't have the strength to even get up, no! Master, please give me your hand!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like Quetzalcoatl is satisfied.  
Now Senpai can train in peace this afterno&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh! You shouldn't, Senpai...Quetzalcoatl is still...!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Gaaaaaaaaahhh!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Aaaaaaaaaaaahhh!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Ah-ha! You fell for it!  
I am still bursting with energy, yes!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
And llave moves are very profound! Please enjoy the move where, the more you squirm, the more tightly wound up you get♡  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...If I had known how things would have turned out, I would have asked for five matches. Now I understand why the chains are necessary.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
To restrain Quetzalcoatl,  
we really do need lots of chains...  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Yes!  
That is nowhere near enough chains to restrain me!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Come on, Master. Flail, flail!  
Mucho, mucho!
