# Iskandar  
  
## Conqueror of Life  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Hrm... What is this wasteland?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
I came along excited about the prospect of a new battle, but this place is cold and bare.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Really? I thought the great King of Conquerors who trampled the Persian desert would find this place nostalgic.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Fool. The glorious battlefields of my memories were blazing gold at day and like tranquil moonlight at night. A sea of sand so mystical, it roused the heart.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
It's nothing like this empty bore of a ruin.  
It's vastly different in epicness and scale.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wouldn't you say an empty plain like this is rather convenient for battle, since you don't need to worry about harming innocent bystanders?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Convenient!? If it's not a fruitful land that gets the heart pumping, how do you know what you're fighting for!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What you're fighting for, huh.  
Then, may I ask, why do you fight?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
It's obvious! To conquer! To reach the undiscovered land and claim it as my own!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I see. I expect nothing less from you, Senpai. You have summoned yet another troublesome Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, what a headache.  
   
**Mash:**   
...I feel that's putting it lightly...  
He's almost a supervillain...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Now, now. There's no need to be so pessimistic.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In order to have a harmonious relationship with Servants, a positive outlook on things is most important, Mash.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Actually, this is fine.  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Are you saying that you have no problem controlling Servants, no matter how extraordinary of a Heroic Spirit they are?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Perhaps that's just your positive thinking talking? ...To be honest, I'm a little concerned about your optimism...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No. In a situation as desperate as this, confidence and optimism are our ultimate weapons.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru has proven yet again [♂ his /♀️ her} high suitability as a Master.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou??? (Suspiciously)  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
King of Conquerors. You seem unimpressed with the world you've been summoned to, but why not think of it this way?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The crisis of destruction we are facing right now has the potential to make every land of this world into barren wastelands.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Which means the enthralling land that you seek to conquer will no longer be if nothing is done.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Oh-ho? That is a grave concern. This is no battle.  
It's simply a disaster.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You are not wrong to think so. To be honest, we do not fully understand the enemy ourselves.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
No matter what it may be, as long as it has a physical body that bleeds when I cut it, I'll have no problem fighting.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Basically, you just want me to slaughter those ghastly creatures coming right at us, yeah?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Say what!? Oh crap!  
Look out, you're surrounded!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Iskandar:**   
...Hm. Now that I've fought against some, I understand. This is no battle. This is some kind of cataclysm.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Meaning?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
There's no passion in the enemy's fist. No emotion nor warm blood coursing through them. They are like locusts or portents of disaster. They are no warriors.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, so you're saying,  
they're like ghosts?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Hm. I cannot simply let such creatures roam free.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We need your help.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You'll regret it if you ignore them.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Indeed. With another conquest up ahead, it seems we need to settle this matter first.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
This is a bizarre turn of events, but as you've summoned me, I shall offer you my sword, Master.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah yes! Now this is what Servant cooperation is all about! See how negotiation can make anything possible, Mash?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
To be honest, I was on guard when I heard the King of Macedonia was here, but he's quite the man! He's so heroic, but not too rough!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I wouldn't call it negotiation...  
I feel like the fight convinced him.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Now that's settled, we need to prepare!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Military strategies change with the time and place.  
I must learn more about this era!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah! That's quite convincing coming from the great hero who sought world domination!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Being summoned as a Servant granted me knowledge of your era, but it does not feel real yet.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Yes, I need...personal experience...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And what kind of preparations do you have in mind?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
First and foremost, information from literature.  
And a map.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm a little surprised that you'd be so meticulous in forming military strategies.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Obviously. A guide is necessary when exploring foreign lands. Maybe not an interpreter, but I do want literature to help steer our way.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Prepare something that lists must-see sights, local foods, and what times are the busy times. Make sure they don't skimp on the details.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
And...clothing. We wouldn't be fully immersing ourselves in local fare if it's just food and lodging.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Attire unique to that country! Just a wardrobe change changes your entire perspective!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
My retainers all hated to do it.  
But it really is amusing.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Look at that smile. It's like saying, “I can get anything I want.” A royal ego like that reminds me of Gil... I mean, a different king that we know.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But when King Iskandar says it, I think I understand why his retainers would give in.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So, this is the king who thought to slice through the Gordian Knot. Only Senpai could summon a Servant like this!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's not true!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe that's true!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, um...yeah. I guess it wouldn't kill us to have a, uh, couple people around with one or two screws loose.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
On that same note, maybe it wouldn't be so strange to have a king who mixes up tourism with conquest.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foooou?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
My point is, no matter what this Heroic Spirit's interpretation of the situation is...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As long as we can count on him in battle, I don't see any issue... I guess?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That may be true...  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Hahaha! That's the spirit!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
As my contractor, that's the attitude you need!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's not necessarily true...  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Hahahaha! There's nothing to fear! Life itself is a battle. Those who enjoy it will be victorious!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
No matter your predicament, first eat your fill! Sing! Rest! Then you can worry about it after!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fou:**   
Foooou... (Dumbfounded)  
  
  
## The Unending Expedition  
  
**Mash:**   
Let me reiterate! We need to retreat immediately! There's nothing we can gain from this battle!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Wahahaha! You may be right, Shield Maiden, but our escape route is now closed off! We just need to bite the bullet.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Unfortunately, he's right, Mash. Now that you've started the battle, you'll need to fight to get through.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This is all because Iskandar just had to meddle...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We could've escaped if you kept quiet...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Come now, don't say that!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
The winds that blow in this land reminded me of Persia. It brought back the days of my passionate young blood!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
And just when I felt like wreaking havoc here again, this lot showed up in need of a real thrashing!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What a meatheaded thought process...  
Senpai, be careful you don't get carried away, too!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash, don't get distracted.  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Wahahaha! That's my Master there! You really do have keen insight into the workings of battle!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, where were you from again?  
Did you work in a super exploitative company before coming to Chaldea?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What I'm saying is that you seem very adept at navigating a conflict and unreasonable demands!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I hate my life!  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Wahaha! Don't say that. Come, even my Bucephalus is excited by the prospect of battle!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foooou!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Even that little squirrel over there is excited!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Besides, this battle may have begun as just a fun romp, but that may not be the case now.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What do you mean?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
When I arrived in this land for an expedition, King Darius' troops were not the only ones who blocked our path.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
They were like the evil spirits that we are fighting right now. They were relentless in ambushing us.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
And along with those old memories...  
My men say their blood is stirring.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
They want to fight! Like back in the day... So fiercely, so courageously! Wagering their short lives for a chance at glory!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Men who had gathered to join in my path to conquer across the sea of sand! That is what they desire!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
So, as king, I must answer their call!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What's with this sudden&mdash;!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Where are we?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A Reality Marble! But this is strange. How could the King of Conquerors as a Rider manage such powerful magecraft?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, wait a minute! I detect numerous Servant signatures nearby!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This... What is going on!?  
I'm detecting more than 10,000!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Ah, look at your faces! Even I am excited. I'm trembling!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Now, raise your voices for battle!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
The time of wonderment is here, Fujimaru, Shield Maiden! This is truly my kingship! My bond! My ultimate Noble Phantasm!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Run them down! Ionioi Hetairoi!!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Amazing... Was that your Noble Phantasm?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The successive Servant summoning was a surprise! How many Servants were there!? Who knew they'd all be Heroic Spirits!?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Yes, indeed. They all went wild to their hearts' content. As usual, my men are unbelievable.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Fujimaru, and Shield Maiden as well. To see you unmoved by the mass of strong enemies was admirable.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
My men were also in awe of your recklessness.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Th-thank you.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
If there ever is another opportunity to wade into battle together, they would be more than happy to, is what they are saying.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Um...I don't quite understand what's going on, but can we assume you will help us out again?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Indeed. Not only do you have my support, but my men have all agreed as well.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Therefore, I declare here and now:  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Under the banner of the King of Conquerors Iskandar, we of the Eastern Expedition Mixed Army shall participate in the Grand Order.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
My Master! Command my Noble Phantasm,  
“Ionioi Hetairoi,” well!
