## E-Pal Wars  
  
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Master, where are you?  
Your Caster's looking for you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's... Tamamo, isn't it?  
What's gotten into her?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh Master, there you are.  
I've been looking for you.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Let's get going, then!  
Come on, come on! This way! Come on!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where are we going?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Um, you're a little too close.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
We're going, of course, to our...  
H O N E Y M O O N♡  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, so that's all it was...  
What!?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Mmm! Blue skies! Sandy beaches!  
And a clear blue sea as far as the eye can see!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
It's the perfect day for a honeymoon,  
isn't it Master?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...That said. (Glance)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...(Hmph)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Well, one or two tag-alongs shouldn't bother us too much.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh, how about something to drink?  
D A R L I N G♪  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I really don't want to know,  
but how did this happen?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I mean, I really, really don't want to know.  
Actually, just forget it.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Too bad, here's how it happened! Listen up. Yesterday,  
I got a message from Kiyohime, my texting buddy.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I just went on a date with my Master,  
who is also my lover.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
A lover's tryst, you could say. A lover's tryst.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
"So, how are things with your Master, Tamamo...  
Oh. (gotcha.) Anyway, I'll text again sometime♪"  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Can you believe she sent that!? What the hell was  
(gotcha.)? What is she saying she got!?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Kids these days... Even Osakabe-hime, who never leaves her room...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Is going on "chat dates!"  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
At this point, I have no choice but to act!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
So I'm sending selfies of me and my Master being lovey-dovey, just to show the two of them who's boss...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So... It doesn't have to be with Senpai, does it?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's right. She just wants to brag that she's getting along well with her Master.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Caster, you're toying with me?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Caster, let's end our contract...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh, no! No! Not at all!  
It's true that I've sworn my soul to another.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Even though I don't quite remember what that person was like, or even which dimension did I encountered them in.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
But that's different!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I respect Fujimaru for making a contract with an Anti-Hero like me, and with no complaints!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I've seduced countless men and committed countless sins. But if I feel this one's the one, I'll serve with my whole spirit&mdash;  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
That is my true nature as Tamamo-no-Mae, the Caster!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Okay, so maybe "honeymoon" was going too far,  
but maybe you can at least call it a vacation? Maybe? Tee hee hee!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry to interrupt, but we have enemies.  
Looks like this is a Lamia spawning ground.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It looks like you're surrounded?  
What? Your discussion's more important? Sorry.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Why now, of all times!?  
Geez, this is just great.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Now I feel awkward, like when you run into an old friend and you find out she's married and has children now...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...I'm going to take it out on these...  
What were they? Lamias?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All right, fine. I'll join you!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah, I know how you feel.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
That's my Master!  
I'm even more in love with you now!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Now that we're both on the same page,  
excuse me while I give a little speech.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I will come to your aid whether you ask for it or not!  
The reliable Shrine Maiden Fox, Casko-chan, now descends upon the tropical seas!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Wow, it sure is nice to relax in a mountain inn,  
isn't it, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sure is.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I want to relax...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
What's going on here...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Don't ask me. No idea...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
So Master...  
Oh who is it, at a time like this...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh, a message from Kiyohime?  
What does it say...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
"Today I went shopping with my Master, who is also my husband."  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
"We went to a famous French clothing store... Oh, what was its name? Anyway, there my Master bought me some Western-style clothes."  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
"I get so put on the spot by things like this. So Tamamo, do you... Oh. (Gotcha.)"  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
"Anyway, I'll text again sometime. -from France with love- Your Kiyohime"  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
This again! I'm asking you, what the hell is this?  
What the hell is this, this (Gotcha.)?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
In the first place, I'm sure her partner is being tricked!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not Kiyohime?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The partner is!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Yes. It's not polite to say, but unlike me,  
Kiyohime can get the weirdest ideas in her head.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Tendencies for love at first sight aside, she often creates relationships in her mind without talking to the men involved.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Her imagination when it comes to these things could put virtual reality to shame. Every relationship she imagines already has marriage on the horizon.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Ultimately she traps the guy inside a bell and burns him to death. That's how she is, so I worry about her partner...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh, I should've brought us lunches or something.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I hate to interrupt, but I'm picking up something...  
Yeah. It looks like we're in wyvern territory.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Again? Jeez, I just want to make some memories with my Master. Why do they keep interrupting?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
This isn't fair!  
My texting buddy does this to me every single day!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Her texts always sound so happy!  
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Me neither.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
ME NEITHER!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Wyverns, flying lizards, I don't know what you are...  
But how I feel on all those Sundays...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
The feeling that I should do something meaningful but ends up on the couch, getting nothing done...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Then after a bath, realizing I'm already getting into bed...  
That dismal feeling...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I'LL TAKE THEM ALL OUT ON YOU!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm actually feeling the same way.  
Oh, Senpai! I was joking! I-I'll do my best!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, I'm glad you two had fun yesterday...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What exactly was all that, anyway?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooouu...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh, Master!  
Trouble! Big trouble!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is it?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Another text message?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Now what is it? Did Osakabe-hime ask you on a double date or something?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
No, she's, you know,  
in the middle of a very cute internet romance.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
The problem is the active one, Kiyohime.  
It seems, um... she got&ndash;dumped.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Yes, apparently she got mad and started setting everything on fire.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I wanted to ignore it, but you know,  
she's a dear friend.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
We'd both promised to enroll in that cooking class held by Benienma from Severed-Tongue Sparrow, you see.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
So out of my deep compassion and love,  
I think Master and I need to stop her!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
It's a friend's job to be supportive at times like this, right?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
&ndash;Though I've never met her in person.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
So come on! Come on! Come! Come!  
With the deep bonds between us,  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
we shall heal poor Kiyohime's wounded heart!  
No ulterior motives, of course!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh, the shield girl is welcome too,  
I suppose...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'll pass.  
Senpai, please try to avoid being burned to death, okay?  
  
  
## Nine-tailed Fox  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
The enemy type is a demon!  
Be careful, the readings are off the chart!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou-foou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Roger. Let's go, Master!  
You be careful too, Tamamo!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Right, right.  
Sure thing, Shieldy!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Shieldy!?  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Whew... That was tough.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Is something wrong, Tamamo?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh no, it's nothing!  
Come on, let's finish off the last of them!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
???  
   
  
  
---  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh, that's Tamamo.  
What's she doing in a place like this?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Sigh...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why the sigh?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Master... I'm sorry.  
You've caught me at an embarrassing moment.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Actually... No, I'm sure you've already noticed. It's about my body.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Your body?  
W-What does she mean, Senpai!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
C-Calm down!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Deep breaths, deep breaths...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I'm sure even Shieldy's noticed,  
but lately, I've been slowing you down.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What did you do, Senpai?!  
...Wait, slowing us down? You, Tamamo?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Indeed... You see, for some reason, I cannot fully use my powers.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It doesn't feel like you're holding back...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
No, I can feel that I am.  
It's my body, after all.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
A long time ago, you see, I had nine fluffy tails and would go around...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...causing havoc everywhere.  
The follies of youth, you understand&ndash;  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I'll spare you the details, but eventually I became deeply, deeply repentant.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I sealed away eight of my evil tails...  
and became a weak, one-tailed fox.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The famous story of the nine-tailed fox. I've never heard that she lost her tails, though.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I'd like to be stronger so that I can be of use to you, Master, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is there a problem?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Yes, when I get stronger, I get more tails. But you see...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
When I get more tails, I become a very different sort of creature than I am now...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Yes, I kind of... I become a great demon strong enough to destroy the multiverse.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Y-You get that strong?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Yes. Understand that this isn't an exaggeration. I become a great demon...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...that is an avatar of the apocalypse itself.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But should I care?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
The thought of you seeing me like that makes me scared to grow more tails...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
But if I can't be useful to you, I'm just a fluffy fox, shrine maiden...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...and the cause of this Holy Grail War is a threat enough to rival my nine-tail self...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I'm not sure what to do.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A battle with your past, huh?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry guys. I hate to interrupt, but there's another monster... A big one!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's bigger than that demon enemy!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, leave this to me and get Tamamo!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
If I could get back at least one more tail, that monster would be nothing...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Aah, I hate myself for having so much hidden power!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Even with more tails, aren't you still Tamamo?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Really, it doesn't bother me.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I know, I know...  
You're just about to get sick of m... MIKON!?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
M-Master!?  
W-What did you say?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Seriously, I don't care.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You'll always be Tamamo.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
What!? So Master, even if I get all nine tails back, and even if I think...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
“Wow, this is ridiculous,” you'll still treat me like you did before?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yup.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I can't believe it! I came to this world by pure chance, and to think the Master I've contracted with out of some sense of fate...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...Would possess such a handsome soul! Oh, but it's not as good as the man I'm destined to be with.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Okay, now I'm really fired up!  
I'm even more serious about this! Yeah!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Even if something terrible happens, you can quell my negative energy, scold me, and exorcise me!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...U-Um, so what exactly are you doing?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Shieldy, I'm sorry for worrying you!  
From this moment, I am reborn&mdash;  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
A reborn Tamamo-no-Mae! That's right! I am the New Tamamotchi, at your service!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Come, come, come, come, come, Master! Come watch the cute little Casko-chan's big moment on stage!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
&ndash;Come now! Those afar, hear my sound! Those nearby, be charmed!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I am the guardian of the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor, the bearer of luck from the Kunluns!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
A mirror of water reflecting the golden sun's rays!  
Behold the Eightfold Blessing!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Mmm! Tamamo W I N S!I feel so good! So good!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You don't have more tails, do you?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Did you power up somewhere?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh, my tails?That's right... To get another tail back...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I need another 500 billion experience points or so?  
So I'll just have one for now.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? Then all that stuff about you growing your tails back...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh, I'm just a worrywart, you know?I'm the type who worries about the future.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
But I'm okay now.With my Master's trust, I'm invincible.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Honestly, I didn't see anything different between that last battle and the one before it...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right... What was all that stuff she was talking about?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They do say the mind rules the body, right?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
This fleeting world is but a moment's dream, just as the lives of men are but morning dew...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
But my contract with you is firmer than the Sesshouseki. I will serve you with all my soul, Master!
