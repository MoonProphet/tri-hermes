# Carmilla  
  
## Alone, Again  
  
**Carmilla:**   
...Master, Master.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Wake up, Master.  
I said, wake up, Master.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Which is your desire, Master;  
the Iron Maiden or the Brazen Bull?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What are you talking about?!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where am I?!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Carmilla:**   
No idea.  
How should I be expected to know such a thing?  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Yet, quite clearly it is a pleasant place.  
Your pet and companion are here as well.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Are you awake, Master?  
...We're trapped somewhere.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It appears we're in some sort of Reality Marble&ndash;  
I'm unable to contact Dr. Roman either.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
It doesn't just appear to be, it most certainly is.  
This is my castle, after all.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What do you mean, "your castle?"&ndash;  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
That's right, this is the Castle Csejte.  
It's best that you don't wonder off somewhere.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
The chances of escaping this castle are a mere one in one thousand. You really ought to relax and wait.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But...  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
At any rate, I know this castle and I'm not going anywhere.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
I am quite comfortable here, after all.  
The smell of blood here is so, so dear to me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh.  
...What should we do, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's move on.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's escape.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Carmilla:**   
...Wait a moment, Master.  
Did you not listen to a word I said?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I heard every word.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Carmilla:**   
In that case, surely you know that you won't find any lies or deception in my words.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Ask your companion, there. Have her tell you the blood-splattered legend of Elisabeth BÃ¡thory.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'll admit, it's exactly as Carmilla says.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The only person to ever to escape here was a one single maiden out of a thousand.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I do believe your safest choice is to wait here...patiently.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We've been imprisoned.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There's no help coming for us.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Carmilla:**   
...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're right. After all...if this is Castle Csejte, we have been imprisoned...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The longer we wait, the more likely we'll be sacrificed...  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Ugh. J-Just how foolish can this woman be?  
Do you understand? This is MY castle.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
How could I be locked inside my own castle?  
Such self-injurious action would never be...never be...  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
...ok, it's completely possible.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
To drain the blood from a beautiful maiden. To skewer a hateful rival. If it were for that purpose, it is a possibility.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Let's get out of here.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Okay, we're escaping.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Carmilla:**   
...As infuriating as it is, I'd have to say that is the proper choice. For the moment, I think I shall follow your orders.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What about traps...?  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Do you think I would bother with such trivial matters?  
All I did was give the order, "Don't allow anyone to escape."  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
As to what manner of security measures were taken, do you think I would bother myself with that?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Uh, well.  
Do you have any advice on how to escape?  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
None whatsoever. Why do you look at me that way?  
You are a mere commoner&mdash;Eek!?  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
A hand extending from the wall?!  
What is this? A haunted mansion?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's a Golem!  
The wall has transformed!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'll destroy it!  
Stand back, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Carmilla:**   
...I'll admit, I do regret my actions a little bit.  
Not knowing anything can be quite a scary thing.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
But, I will say this. Master, if you ever make a mockery of my foolishness, it's the Iron Maiden for you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ummm, I don't see an exit anywhere...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou?  
Don't rush ahead like that...!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, stay close by!  
It's an enemy!  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
But this is no Golem.  
Yes...It appears we finally meet the true foe.  
  
   
**???:**  
&ndash;I hate you!  
  
   
**???:**  
&ndash;I cannot stand you!  
I will never, ever forgive you!  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Mere phantom of this castle... You weakest of the weak,  
lowest of the low! How dare you stand before me!  
  
   
**Young Girl:**   
What did you say? ...Just because you are a noble...  
you killed me...How dare you...How dare you!  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
That's right. Being a noble is my way of life. I am afraid to say that I am not the type to be tormented by guilt.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
I am evil. Utter and thorough evil. Void of salvation,  
I am a ludicrous beast that died in sheer despair.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
However, I am not so foolish to have regretted my evil and lost sight of what lies before me.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
It was perfectly logical to curse me, but to invite these ones in as well was foolish.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
You will receive pity if you were to only curse me, to curse all of those living, then you're no better than me.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
In that case&mdash;I shall crush you, without a shred of mercy.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Even if you are a phantom, I will wring every last drop of blood from you!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Carmilla:**   
...Hmph! The hem of my dress has been torn.  
That was somewhat of an inconvenience.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Let us be on our way, Master.  
The exit shouldn't be far.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What's the matter, Carmilla?  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Nothing at all. Only a slight headache.  
...Master, let me ask you this.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
This is just an "if." If the door does not open...  
and we are truly locked in this castle, what will you do?  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Would you give up in despair?  
Or would you&ndash;?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I would find another exit.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I would not give up.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Carmilla:**   
...I see.  
I figured you would say as much.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Even in such a desperate situation, you'll continue fighting without giving up.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Just because you've been imprisoned,  
you're not the type to lie down and give up.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
An enemy!  
It's a&ndash;Shadow Servant...!?  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Oh, dear... I am imprisoned again.  
Again, I am all alone.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again there is no one to rescue me...!!  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
No! No! Stop...! I don't want to go back to that place! No! No! Noooo!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Pull yourself together!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I will rescue you this time.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Carmilla:**   
...!  
Master...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Here it comes...!  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
&ndash;So it is.  
Now, I am your Servant.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Even though it was my fate to become imprisoned, it is illogical that you should be imprisoned as well.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Master! Mash! Listen to me closely.  
This is merely "darkness!"  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
It is a darkness that envelopes this castle, preventing escape. It is the final barrier, the absolute ruler.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
I cannot overcome this alone.  
But now, I have you with me.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
To battle! Now is the time for me to make these ones pay for what has been done!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
We destroyed them!  
We can open the door...!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
...Well done.  
You have successfully escaped.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What about you, Carmilla?  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Never mind me. You go on.  
You should return to Chaldea.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
This place is nothing more than a world of my own imagining.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
As long as my fate has been determined, there is no hope of my escaping this place.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
You see, for me to escape imprisonment would be a rejection of my life, my fate, my everything.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
However&ndash;You are different. I must help you. Even if the chances are one in a thousand, I must help my Master.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
...Do not worry. This is a dream. Merely a nightmare. You will forget all of it when you awake.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
In matter of fact, what if...  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
What if, I had met someone like you when I was "Elisabeth."  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
What if, I had reached out to a beacon of light like you.  
Then I&ndash;  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
&ndash;Oh!  
You're awake! Master.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
...Why, you look as if you were struck by a popgun.  
Did you have a strange dream?  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
That's right. It was just a dream. Put it out of your mind. More importantly, it is still night time.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
There is still time before morning comes.  
Go back to sleep once more.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
And this time&ndash;have a pleasant dream.  
Good night, Master.
