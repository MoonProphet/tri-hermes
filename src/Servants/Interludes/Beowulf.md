# Beowulf  
  
## Grendel's Second Coming  
  
**Beowulf:**   
Anomaly during summons?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Doctor says that when you were summoned, there was a disturbance during this era in this spot.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That might be the reason why you can't unlock your second Noble Phantasm.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Something else was summoned at the same time...  
The answer's simple.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So&ndash;you think it's Grendel?  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
No doubt. I can't think of anything besides him that could influence the summoning process.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
It's true there are nameless fire dragons out there...  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
But Grendel was the only monster with such fierce hate and glory in my life.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
He was an evil creature who played with people's lives.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
The kind of evil that reveled in the meaningless slaughter of people trapped in their dwellings.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
I can understand fights over territory,  
or animals just fighting for survival.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
But&ndash;Grendel had both reason and intellect and was simply evil.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
That's why his very existence...  
is far more of a threat to me than that of a fire dragon.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Fire dragons are passive as long as you leave their treasure alone. But Grendel's a twisted monster who revels in evil.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
If he revived as a side-effect of my summoning&ndash;  
I gotta kill him.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Then let's go. The last response was in the old castle up ahead.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If you take a look at it, maybe you'll figure something out.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Okay.  
Let's go, Master.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
There are some things that shouldn't exist in this world.  
Grendel is one of them.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's&ndash;deserted.  
Not a soul to be seen.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
I can smell blood.  
It seems we missed our chance.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh...  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Mash, can you tell? Looks like every last human in this castle was slaughtered.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
...Damn.  
This isn't good.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
The more human flesh he consumes, the more powerful and evil he gets. We have to crush him before he attains his perfect form.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But, where is he&ndash;?  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Something's close!  
Mash, prepare for battle!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's coming!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Beowulf:**   
Damn... We didn't take it down!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
W-Was that a chimera?  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Grendel is a protean creature.  
He can change his form depending on the situation.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
That's why I need Hrunting,  
because it tracks enemies.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Let's go after him. Follow me!  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
So, here...  
  
   
**Soldier A:**   
H-Help me...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That...  
  
   
**Soldier A:**   
Help me...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wait, now!  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Stop!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wh-Why&ndash;!?  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
...Enough of this stupid farce, Grendel.  
Hrunting is eager to bite into you.  
  
   
**???:**  
...  
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What, a fake&ndash;?  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Something like that!  
Let's go, Master. It's not a human, so don't hold back!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Beowulf:**   
He ran away again. Listen up, young lady.  
Don't trust whoever it is you next meet in this castle.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Also, don't be surprised by who you run into.  
He can read your mind like a book.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
When he appears again, he'll likely take the form of someone we know.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Brace yourself, it's gonna be painful.  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Beowulf:**   
Just a little more...  
Hey, come on out already!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Nero:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Drake:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...T-These are all fakes!?  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Right. What looks like armor and clothes is hardened skin. The weapons are extensions of claws and hair.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Pretty nasty, right?  
That's why he's evil.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
But luckily it looks like we can kill him before he starts talking to us.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He talks?  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Only based on the speech in the memories he extracts.  
  
   
**Grendel:**   
...N-No.  
I'm just...not...used...to this body yet.  
  
   
**Grendel:**   
I don't know...why I was...summoned.  
But...I'll do what...I have to.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What on earth...  
  
   
**Grendel:**   
I'll kill you...in a cruel way.  
Every last one...in cold blood.  
  
   
**Grendel:**   
That's how it is.  
That's how it must be.  
  
   
**Grendel:**   
That's what makes me Grendel. Like how I feasted on the human souls back in that castle!  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Shut up. You probably just heard that from your mom. I'll make sure the two of you are nice and cozy together in hell.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Master, let's go!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Grendel:**   
D-Damn you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh... I feel queasy... I know they're fakes, but the sensation when you hit them...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But it's all over now, right?  
There's no response. Let's head back.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
...  
...Master, don't you think something's off?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't know.  
   
**Beowulf:**   
I see...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah, vaguely.  
   
**Beowulf:**   
You've got a sharp nose.  
That's my Master.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
What do you mean?  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
It's a vicious creature we're dealing with.  
Not the sort to accept death without a struggle.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
...Something smells.  
Can we search a little longer?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Okay... If you think it's a good idea,  
there's no problem.  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
He's nowhere to be found...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
...Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou, fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Below us?  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Oh, damn, I didn't notice.  
This castle has a cellar. Let's check it out.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can't believe the cellar connects to a place like this...  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
So that thing faked his death and fled here.  
Which means&ndash;  
  
   
**Grendel:**   
Ugh... D-Damn you...  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
We've got you cornered.  
Your mom's not here, buddy.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
I'll send you to hell where you belong!  
I, Beowulf, will show you no mercy!  
  
   
**Grendel:**   
I could say...the same...  
I've read the memory...of the one who killed you!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Beowulf:**   
It's over, Grendel.  
You're a monster that's not meant to be summoned.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
We'll likely never meet again.  
...Dammit, I met the one I wanted to meet the least.  
  
   
**Grendel:**   
Wh-Why...  
The one...who killed...you...  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Actually, you're the one I fear the most in this world.  
The fire dragon simply dealt the killing blow.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
It was strong, but didn't frighten me.  
I also now have dependable allies, unlike then.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
You're a fool to not see that.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Good riddance, masquerader.  
You should've had a bit more faith in your own strength.  
  
   
**Grendel:**   
D-Damn you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Seems we really got him this time!  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Guess so. My Noble Phantasm is unlocked now.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
In the future you'll face punks looking for a fight.  
When that happens, let me help you.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Well then, I guess we should head back, Master! Time for our triumphant return! Hah hah!
