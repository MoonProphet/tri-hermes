# Aśvatthāman  
  
## After the Rage  
  
**Narration:**   
Anger swells up, explodes, and settles.  
  
**Narration:**   
It's a lot like a bomb, or a flash of light.  
  
**Narration:**   
Anger is by no means a negative emotion.  
  
**Narration:**   
Everyone has the right to get angry at  
things like injustice, oppression, and malice.  
  
**Narration:**   
But, all that being said...  
  
**Narration:**   
...do I still have a right to get angry?  
  
**Tristan:**   
Hmm, I see.  
  
**Tristan:**   
Speaking as an outsider, I would say that,  
while getting angry is every person's right...  
  
**Tristan:**   
...taking out anger you've held onto from life on third parties who had nothing to do with it seems wrong to me.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
Exactly.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
My anger comes from the injustice I witnessed  
back when I was alive.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
And I can't shake the idea that it's wrong to take it out on others, even if they're enemies.  
  
**Chiron:**   
If there is a significant difference in combat prowess between when you are angry and when you are not, then that is certainly an issue.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
Good question. I guess being angry  
might make fighting a little easier for me.  
  
**Chiron:**   
In that case, it would most likely behoove you to remain angry during battle.  
  
**Chiron:**   
That being said, if this anger is having  
a negative affect on your mind...  
  
**Chiron:**   
...then we cannot simply ignore it.  
I suspect Master feels the same way.  
  
**Narration:**   
Yeah... That's true.  
I nod along in agreement.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Anger and rage are necessary emotions for anyone.  
We Servants are no exception.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Indeed, I'm sure that some heroes were only summoned here due to feats that were driven by righteous anger.  
  
**Chiron:**   
However, anger also requires fuel.  
  
**Chiron:**   
It costs both physical and mental energy to be angry.  
  
**Chiron:**   
So it is surprisingly difficult to remain in a  
perpetual state of either anger or grief.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Is that not the case for you?  
  
**Narration:**   
  
I cock my head and think about Chiron's question.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
He's right. It is difficult to stay perpetually angry.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
But for some reason, I still have plenty of anger to go around.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Hmmm.  
What about the strain it puts on your mind?  
  
**Narration:**   
  
...I don't know.  
  
**Tristan:**   
You don't know?  
  
**Tristan:**   
So you have no idea whether your anger  
puts any strain on you whatsoever?  
  
**Narration:**   
  
I nod.  
  
**Narration:**   
This emotion&ndash;this burning, all-consuming rage&ndash;has never been a burden.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
If anything, it's only given me energy to spare.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
It keeps my mind constantly elated, to the point where I don't even realize I'm tired.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Very good. In that case...  
  
**Chiron:**   
I think we'd better talk to Master.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
So now, I need your advice!  
What should I do? Huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You three make, um...quite the combination.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Hahaha, I suppose we do.  
  
**Chiron:**   
We may all be Archers, but we come from very different times, regions, and cultures, to say the least.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I feel like I'm looking at RGB personified.  
  
**Tristan:**   
As in red, green, and blue?  
...Yes, I suppose I can see that.  
  
**Tristan:**   
I guess I must be green, Chiron blue,  
and Aśvatthāman red.  
  
**Tristan:**   
Though it's still hard to say as to whether we complement each other or not.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I see...  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
It's not healthy for me to always be angry all the time.  
That makes sense.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
But right now, I can't do anything unless I'm angry.  
At least, I think so.  
  
**Mash:**   
But, um, aren't we talking normally now, without you being angry?  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
I can keep it in check for a little bit.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
But that's not the same thing as getting rid of it completely, right?  
  
**Chiron:**   
Besides, we wouldn't be here asking for help if this issue could be managed by simply having him keep it in check.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Exactly.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do you want to keep your anger in check?  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Well, I definitely want to do something about it before I end up making trouble for someone...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So you wouldn't rather just stay the way you are?  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
I don't think this is a good way to be.  
It's not natural to be angry all the time.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Maybe you should talk to Pārvatī.  
She might have a good idea.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Ulp.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
...Sorry, Mash, but I'd really rather not do that.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
It's like, uh... How can I put this...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You don't want to ask your mom for help now that you're grown up?  
  
**Chiron:**   
Hahaha. That's certainly one apt way to put it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You don't want to worry her?  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Basically.  
Please, I'm begging you here!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Keeping anger in check...  
What about facilitated relaxation?  
  
**Mash:**   
You could try forest therapy to calm your mind, get a massage to relieve the tension in your muscles... I've heard things like that can work wonders for relaxing!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
I got no idea what the hell forest therapy's supposed to be... But okay, let's give 'em a shot!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All right, let's do it!  
  
---  
  
**Chiron:**   
I think I will come with you then. What about you, Tristan? Will you be joining us as well?  
  
**Tristan:**   
Forest therapy... I like the sound of that.  
I was just thinking I could use a good nap.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No sleeping during therapy.  
  
---  
  
**Tristan:**   
Yes, Master.  
  
**Mash:**   
Okay then, I'll go get the simulator ready!  
  
**Narration:**   
Forest therapy.  
  
**Narration:**   
They say it's a kind of, well, therapeutic treatment that involves going into a woods to relax.  
  
**Narration:**   
Apparently, it's all 'cause of things like phytoncides and air quality and a change of environment and such.  
  
**Narration:**   
Well, if nothing else, it ought to be good for the mind.  
  
**Narration:**   
Except...  
  
**Narration:**   
...it doesn't seem to work that well in dense South American jungles.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Frick, it's hot here.  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry. I think I got one of the settings wrong...  
  
**Tristan:**   
So much for taking a nap.  
  
**Tristan:**   
Hehe. Now that I take a closer look, I can see there are all sorts of insects happily buzzing about the air here.  
  
**Tristan:**   
Well, I can't actually see them, since I'm too scared of bugs to open my eyes, but I can still sense them.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're scared of bugs!?  
  
---  
  
**Tristan:**   
Yes. I've always hated bugs. They just look much too much like fairies for my liking. That, and vampiric horses...  
  
**Chiron:**   
Oh? I'll have you know that some insects are actually very nutritious. They're essential eating when it comes to wilderness survival.  
  
**Tristan:**   
What? You mean some people have to eat bugs to survive? I can't even imagine it... So I won't. I'm just going to pretend I never heard that...  
  
**Chiron:**   
I see. Well, you certainly don't HAVE to eat them, especially if you have access to meat, fruit, and veggies.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Never mind that.  
What do we do about this?  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Forget about relaxing! All this heat and humidity's only cranking up my anger energy!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Good, perfect timing! Sorry guy, but like it or not, I'm taking my anger out on you!  
  
**Chiron:**   
Here, let us help.  
  
**Mash:**   
A-all right! Initiating simulation battle!  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Eat this!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Dammit. I thought that might help  
get my anger under control...  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
But thanks to how damn hot these things were,  
I'm more pissed off than before!  
  
**Tristan:**   
I'm sorry to hear that.  
  
**Tristan:**   
In that case, I think it's time we tried some real forest therapy.  
  
**Chiron:**   
I would appreciate that. I don't think I can  
stand much more of this heat, either.  
  
**Mash:**   
R-right.  
  
**Mash:**   
Okay, I'll make sure to set the next environment to a proper forest that you can use for therapy.  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Tristan:**   
That's it.  
This is just what I had in mind.  
  
**Tristan:**   
It really is peaceful here. Forests are green,  
and of course, I am synonymous with green.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Really? 'Cause when I think of green, I think of Robin Hood.  
  
**Tristan:**   
...  
  
**Tristan:**   
No, it's me.  
  
**Mash:**   
(He really doesn't want to let this go!)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Isn't Chiron more closely associated with green?  
  
**Tristan:**   
...  
...(Zzz).  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Stop sleeping!  
  
**Tristan:**   
Oh, I wasn't sleeping. That's just the sound I make when I'm not ready to admit defeat.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Uh...  
  
**Chiron:**   
When it comes to Tristan, I've found it's best to just not think about him too hard.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
...Gotcha...  
  
---  
  
**Chiron:**   
All right, since there don't seem to be any Demonic Beasts nearby, let's try some deep breathing exercises to complement the forest therapy.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Got it.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Okay everyone, line up, please.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Now, let's take some deep breaths.  
Inhale...  
  
**Chiron:**   
Exhale...  
  
**Chiron:**   
Inhale...  
  
**Chiron:**   
Exhale...  
  
**Chiron:**   
Inhale, then expel all of your breath at once,  
building up power throughout your entire body...  
  
**Chiron:**   
And stick out your fist...  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Ha!  
  
**Tristan:**   
Hra!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
...How's that supposed to help us relax?  
  
**Chiron:**   
I'm sorry. Old habits.  
All right, let's try meditation next.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You ready?  
  
---  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Hell yeah!  
  
**Chiron:**   
Start by sitting down in a comfortable position,  
then close your eyes.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Now, look for the source of your anger.  
  
**Narration:**   
That statement takes me a little by surprise.  
  
**Narration:**   
Anger... The source of my anger.  
  
**Narration:**   
That cowardly plot, unbefitting of warriors.  
The enemy army that decided to carry it out.  
  
**Narration:**   
My pathetic self, unable to stop it.  
My comrades, falling one after another.  
  
**Narration:**   
That was why I got so mad that I broke the rules  
of warfare and massacred them during the night.  
  
**Chiron:**   
That's not the only reason.  
  
**Narration:**   
That statement sends me reeling.  
I want to jump down his throat...but I resist.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Anger like that would never last the way yours does.  
There must be something more to it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You mean he's angry at something else?  
  
---  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
I...  
  
**Narration:**   
Yeah... He's right.  
I mean, I really was angry back then...  
  
**Narration:**   
But the anger I feel now is different.  
It takes over my whole body, tormenting me.  
  
**Narration:**   
Where does this anger come from?  
What in the world is it?  
  
**Chiron:**   
That anger isn't right for you.  
  
**Chiron:**   
If it were, you would be able to understand it.  
  
**Narration:**   
...This anger isn't right.  
  
**Narration:**   
...  
  
**Narration:**   
Is it the anger I felt for being punished?  
...No, it's not that.  
  
**Narration:**   
I agreed with that punishment.  
In fact...  
  
**Narration:**   
I remember thinking it didn't go far enough.  
  
**Narration:**   
That's right. I wasn't punished enough.  
  
**Narration:**   
I've never felt like I fully atoned for what I did. I just kept wandering around wearing myself down until the next thing I knew, I was a Heroic Spirit.  
  
**Narration:**   
I remember thinking I was sure I was going to keep being punished.  
  
**Narration:**   
And yet...  
  
**Narration:**   
That's right.  
Chaldea's way too good for a sinner like me.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
I see it now.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
I'm angry at myself.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
I'll never be able to atone for what I did in a paradise like this.  
  
**Chiron:**   
...You're wrong.  
  
**Chiron:**   
That's it. That guilt is the indescribable  
source of your anger.  
  
**Chiron:**   
That rage you feel towards yourself  
is what you need to fight!  
  
**Chiron:**   
Concentrate. You're a warrior, are you not?  
  
**Chiron:**   
Then you should be used to fighting yourself.  
  
**Narration:**   
Yeah. I am. But...  
  
**Narration:**   
...I'm not at all confident I can win.  
  
**Narration:**   
After all, I've been holding on to this anger for thousands of years.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Hahahaha.  
No need to worry about that.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Did you forget who's there beside you?  
  
**Narration:**   
...Yeah. Good point.  
In that case...  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
So Master, I hate to ask you this...but would you mind giving me a hand fighting my own redemption?  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Listen well, my millennia-old anger.  
I will vanquish you in the name of duty.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
I'm here to help save humanity. To help set it right.  
It's natural to be angry at any and all injustice.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
But in your case...you're much too big for a simple archer like me to carry by myself.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
...  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
So it's time for us to go our separate ways,  
even if it should cost me my life!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Here I come!!!  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
All right! We won!!!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
B-but I didn't do anything...  
  
---  
  
**Tristan:**   
...I see.  
  
**Tristan:**   
As a first-rate warrior, he must be able to simulate a battle where you were there giving him orders, Master.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Well? Is your anger gone now?  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
...  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
It's not that simple.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Perhaps not, but you can tell your relationship to it has changed, no?  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Yeah, I can.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
My anger wasn't just directed at other people.  
It was also directed at me.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
And just being aware of that  
makes a world of difference.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Thanks, Master.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh, you're welcome, but I really didn't do anything!  
  
---  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Hahahaha!  
  
**Tristan:**   
And so♪  
His Master♪  
  
**Tristan:**   
Birthed a new legend♪  
By winning despite doing nothing♪  
  
**Tristan:**   
Ahh, how very jealous I am♪  
Strum strum, strum strum♪  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Would you please stop singing that song already!?  
  
**Tristan:**   
I'm sorry. Your bewildered face was just so amusing that I couldn't help myself.  
  
**Gareth:**   
That's enough, Sir Tristan!  
Zip it!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Ugh! Stupid Tristan!  
  
**Tristan:**   
I see. Insults, is it?  
Well, that's okay. They don't bother me♪  
  
**Tristan:**   
For a poet is not truly a poet♪  
Unless they are also a nuisance♪  
  
**Gareth:**   
You're not even the least bit sorry, are you, Sir Tristan? I never could tell what you're thinking.  
  
---  
  
**Chiron:**   
How are you, Aśvatthāman?  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
You know, I'm doing all right.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
The time I'm spending here in peace, laughing and having fun with these guys I now call my friends... That's all the atonement I need.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
And it's not unpleasant for me,  
so I'm not gonna ruin the mood.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
My suffering'll last as long as I live, but I'll also be able to enjoy the good things in life.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
'Cause they're both perfectly valid ways  
for me to be who I am.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Wonderful. That answer was so good I'm tempted to give you an A+ on your report card.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Thanks, but there's no way I'm  
going back to school at this age.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
...Then again, maybe that wouldn't be so bad...  
  
**Chiron:**   
Well, if you're ever in the mood for a lesson,  
I'm always accepting new students.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Hm?  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
...Thank you for everything.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
I hope my uncertainty, and my anger,  
always remain in their proper place...  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
...and that you will continue to  
watch over both myself and Master...  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
...Lady Pārvatī.  
  
**Pārvatī:**   
...Thank goodness.  
It seems there was no need for me to get involved.  
  
**Pārvatī:**   
Seeing them grow, inspire, and motivate themselves like this is the greatest reward I could ask for.  
  
**Pārvatī:**   
Now then, I think I'd better check in on someone else who could use a little motivation!  
  
**Pārvatī:**   
You can't just spend every day doing nothing but playing video games, after all!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
So tell me, Master:  
What is it you're angry about right now?  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Whatever it is, I know you'll have a good reason to be angry over it. And I'll always be there to help.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
After all...isn't that what Servants are for?
