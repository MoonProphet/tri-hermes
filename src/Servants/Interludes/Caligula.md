**Fou:**   
Fou, foou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, as for today's plans&ndash;Fou?  
Wh-What is going on in this room?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There are posters all over the wall...  
Are these posters of Nero?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, Mash? You came at just the right time!  
This Berserker...I mean, Caligula!  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
My...beautiful...niece...  
My...beautiful...treasure...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-These are all posters of the Emperor Nero...  
Wh-What in the world is going on here...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I don't know! I was suddenly called to Fujimaru's room, and this is what I found... I'd like to know why as well.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do you like Emperor Nero?  
   
**Caligula:**   
Nero...  
My lovely sister's...daughter...

**Fujimaru 2:**   
Imperator!!!  
   
**Mash:**   
What are you talking about, Senpai?!

**Da Vinci:**   
Ummm, I'm sorry to interrupt your fun, but Roman soldiers are wrecking havoc throughout Rome.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
If we do nothing, it's going to be bad, right? This era will end up being inconsistent with the actual history.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, dammit! Why now?  
Can you go, Fujimaru?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No problem.  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's hurry, Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I cannot allow anyone to disturb Rome's peace!  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right...  
What's gotten into you, Senpai?

**Caligula:**   
My...niece's...city...  
Who dares...to cause...havoc...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What?  
You're going too?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Over there, Master!  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Anyone who would commit the crime of devastating my beloved niece's Rome&ndash; Shall be punished by death!  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
&ndash;Neroooooooo!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It looks like Caligula is up to the task as well!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, I don't think this is quite the same...  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Caligula:**   
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)&ndash;Hng!!  
My... Ooohh&ndash;Nerooooooo!!!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Whoa! He's getting really fired up!  
I-Is he, ok?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, Doctor.  
He may look like he's enraged,  
  
   
**Mash:**   
but he's guiding the enemy away so the city won't sustain any damage.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A-Are you serious?  
Even though he's a Berserker?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's obvious he has considerable love for the city of Rome. Let us continue on as well, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Whew... Somehow we were able to fight them off. It appears that we kept the damage to the city to a minimum.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
The city...my lovely...niece loved...  
I laud...its beauty...for all...eternity...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He's going too far. What do you call that... a doting father? No, he's her uncle, so a doting uncle?

**Fujimaru 1:**   
He certainly loves Emperor Nero.  
   
**Mash:**   
That's an odd way to express his affection, but he certainly holds Nero in high esteem.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Rome, forever!  
   
**Mash:**   
H-Hold on a second here, Senpai! Are you all right?  
Are you sure you didn't hit your head in that last battle?

**Caligula:**   
Beautiful...So beautiful...! You eclipse even the moon...the pride of Rome...You are so beautiful!
