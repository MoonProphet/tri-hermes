## Once Upon a Time in the Forest...  
  
**Boudica:**   
~♪  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
~♪  
~♪♪♪  
   
  
**Boudica:**   
...Hmm?  
What is it?  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Oh, sorry. Was I humming? It's been so long since I've walked through my home forest.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
I just, you know?  
I was just enjoying myself.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Anyway, Fujimaru, are you okay?  
We've been walking a long way. Are you tired?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm fine.  
   
**Boudica:**   
I see. Okay.  
Glad you're doing well!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What about you? You okay?  
   
**Boudica:**   
Hahaha, I'm a Servant!  
I've got tons of stamina.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(That's what I always say, but today she said it first&ndash;)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(N-No, it doesn't matter. It's not important.)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, what is it, Fou?  
Why are you rubbing against me?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fo, foou.  
Kyuu!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I think Fou's trying to make you feel better.  
Boudica's like everyone's big sister.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So Fujimaru ends up being like her little [♂ brother /♀️ sister}. Yup, yup.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And that means Mash is going to feel lonely.  
&ndash;That's what Fou's saying, I think.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Thank you, Fou.  
But don't worry about me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Both Boudica and I are Master's Servants.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't feel lonely&ndash;  
Not at all.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It actually makes me feel better to have more people looking out for Master.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Oh, right.  
Before we rayshifted...  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
I used the kitchen in the Chaldea living quarters to make us some lunch.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
If you're hungry, would you like to have some?  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
I tried making Japanese rice balls.  
It's my first time, so I don't know if they'll be good&ndash;  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
But if you're hungry, how about it?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I am feeling hungry.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Boudica:**   
Really? Great!  
Okay&ndash;let's take a break here.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Hey, Mash, how about it?  
Can we rest?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, yes. It should be safe.  
We need to give Senpai a chance to rest, too.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Hooray♪ Let's eat, then!  
I think we could rest by that grass over there, right?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right.  
We won't need to lay down a blanket then&ndash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm jealous you guys get to have a picnic!  
I'm eating by myself...wait!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Multiple magical energy signature detected!  
We may have found our target!  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Oh, jeez!  
I was looking forward a good relaxation in the forest.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
These nasty little goblins are interrupting just when it's getting good!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Multiple packs coming from the front, Master!  
Be careful.  
  
   
**???:**  
...Heheh.  
Yummy woman...yummy...hahaha.  
  
   
**???:**  
Kill the men...  
Take the women back to the nest, heheh.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
!!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Delicious-looking women? ...O-Oh no!  
I heard the ancient Celtic goblins were primitive!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But this goes beyond primitive, and sounds like they're planning something weird!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
B-But are they?  
Are they planning something weird!?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fo, foou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor? Fou, too...?  
Why are you so agitated?  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Not only have you interrupted our rest, you have defiled the forests of Britannia&ndash;  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
I was planning on resting Fujimaru on my lap and give the Master a much needed pampering&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
I don't know if it's the Grail's influence, but these goblins have grown bigger than usual!  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
I remember normal goblins being a little bit smaller than this!  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
You weird goblins, I will never&ndash;  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Ever, lose to you!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
!!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
!!!  
  
   
**???:**  
!!!!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? Y-You're not doing that on purpose, right!?  
Boudica, that's what people say when they lose&ndash;  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Huh?  
What?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, what are you saying?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
L-Let's just fight!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We will never lose!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Master!  
Commencing combat!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
"...Damn it..."  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
"...You captured us girls..."  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
"...And took us here...  
What are you going to do to us..."  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hehehehe, just what you think!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hehehehe, you'll find out soon!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
"...O-Oh no..."  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
"...Sob... I-If you're going to do that to us, I'd rather you just..."  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, Senpai, what are you doing?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
First you ordered a panting Boudica to  
"Look down, embarrassed," during battle...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...and then you started saying this weird stuff...  
Why? What's the meaning of this?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, hahaha! It's nothing!  
I just wanted to try it!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I couldn't help myself.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Boudica:**   
Hahaha, I had fun!  
Anyway&ndash;  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Thanks for coming with me, guys. We wiped out those bad goblins from my home's forests.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
When you fixed Nero's era, I got a bad feeling.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
So I came here to check it out, and sure enough, I was right.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I believed in you.  
I knew your intuition was correct.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Thanks, Mash. You really are a good girl.  
I'll give you something nice later.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
N-Not really...  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
But I've never seen goblins swell up like that.  
There were so many, and they attacked us.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Forest spirits aren't necessary always like that, you know.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
It should be rare to see them at all.  
Hmm...  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Maybe this is the Grail's doing?  
What a mess that thing makes.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, yeah. If you look through the records it causes all kinds of trouble.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is it that easy...  
for human wishes to cause disaster?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Grail can grant any wish, so it can easily cause disasters. Which means that maybe...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Human wishes themselves often bring disaster.  
That's just a theory though&ndash;  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Yes.  
You might be right.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
But I don't think I want to believe that.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Wishes are supposed to be...  
They're supposed to be much simpler things.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
More humble, and warmer, I think.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
For example...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
For example?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Like eating a nice meal with someone you love, maybe.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
That's what I mean.  
Do you understand&ndash;what I'm saying?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yup! Lunchtime!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's get back to that break!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Boudica:**   
Hahaha, that's right! Now, sit down.  
I'll get the lunches out!  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Fujimaru, you sit next to me.  
Come on, you too, Mash! You sit next to me, too!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!
