# Stheno  
  
## It's Not Impossible?  
  
**Mash:**   
...Treasure hunting?  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
No, it is a bit different.  
The purpose of this request is different from before.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
What I want to ask you is to hunt down the one who wrecked the place where I hid the treasure.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
The place is, yes, where I previously materialized.  
The Shaped Isle&ndash;in the 1st Century.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I remember.  
It's a tiny island in the Mediterranean Sea.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Yes.  
On that island, I hid away many treasures.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
I thought I could go reclaim them if I was summoned as a Heroic Spirit again, like now.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
But when I went there to check things out, the peaceful paradise was no more.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
I'm sure back in the 1st Century some wretch dug the treasures up.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I...see?  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
As far as I can tell, the culprits most certainly are undead monsters.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
What do you say, everyone.  
You just need to drive them out of that place.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Can't you do it for me?  
Doctor Romani?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wh-What? Me?  
Why would you ask me? Ahem.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If it's the request from the beautiful goddess Stheno, I'd love to accept it, however&ndash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Back at the Second Singularity, you asked us something really unreasonable...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We just figured...  
This time is going to be the same...  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Oh, what a shame.  
Can't you do it, for me?  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Hey, Fujimaru. My master.  
It's my request, you'd do it for me, right?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou fooou.  
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Just like the Doctor said, Senpai.  
I'm sorry about her, but we have a duty.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Answer her properly.  
Senpai, you are her master.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course, goddess!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wretches are unforgivable!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay, if that's the case, I'll help you, too!!  
Rayshift preparations! Complete! Looking good!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Even you, Doctor!  
Can it be Stheno's Charm skill!?  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Heheh, can you not call it a skill, please?  
It is exactly what I am.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
I am a goddess. I am a phenomenon born with the wish to captivate any and every hero.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Like I said.  
I'm sorry about it, but.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Please, come with me.  
I'm sure it will be a very fun event, so do your best.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I feel the phrases "very fun" and "do your best"  
sound contrary to one another&ndash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Commence Rayshift!  
Let's do it!  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Both of you, take care♪  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah&ndash;!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...We're here.  
This is the Mediterranean island we visited before...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
How is Senpai doing...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What? Why are we on an island?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Weren't we in Chaldea?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like you've regained sanity.  
I'm glad.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We're on the Shaped Isle in the 1st Century, which we visited during the correction of the Second Singularity.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, this is due to you and the Doctor accepting to take on Stheno's "request."  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So...Is there anything else I need to explain?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's okay, I remember now.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Now that you mention it...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's go, guys!  
According to Lady Stheno, she hid the treasure in a cave!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's that cave we entered before.  
You know where it is. Well, be on your way!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Looks like Doctor is still charmed.  
Guess there's no choice... but to go to the cave...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It cant be helped.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's complete it ASAP.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai.  
Let's finish this quickly.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Be careful, I feel there's a battle coming.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Speak of the devil, it looks like an enemy response!  
Senpai, stay back!  
  
   
**???:**  
Gegege...  
I won't allow you go any further...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This magical energy feels like an undead monster...?  
It is exactly like the information Stheno gave us&ndash;  
  
   
**???:**  
All for our beautiful goddess Lady Stheno... As Lady Stheno commanded, we must protect her treasure!  
  
   
**???:**  
We will risk our lives to eliminate the intruders!  
Although we don't have any lives to risk!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Instead of some wretches who dug up the treasure...  
They sound like they're the ones protecting it!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What? Then the real culprits are...  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I'm sure that's it!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's good to hear, no problem at all!  
   
**Mash:**   
Not, not exactly&ndash;  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
"We are the culprits" here!  
As I thought, Stheno was pulling a prank on us!  
  
   
**???:**  
Go home, go home!  
We won't give you the treasures, go home!  
  
   
**???:**  
Woooo! Lady Stheno, woooo!  
We won't forgive the intruders!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Charm works even on undead monsters...  
No, this is the power of a goddess born to be loved!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, they're coming!  
We can't avoid combat!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
...Somehow, we managed to defeat them.  
The battle is over.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We're almost in the deepest point of the cave, so what should we do, Senpai?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's take the treasure!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Tips for this errand!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
You're... right.  
We came this far, let's be thorough in playing the culprit.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A tiny part of me has thoughts about this.  
Just a tiny part.  
  
   
**???:**  
...I'm sorry.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!?  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Seems my older sister is being unreasonable...  
I'm sorry, I apologize for the inconvenience.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You are...  
Servant Rider...Medusa.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Why are you here&ndash;Ah.  
Don't tell me you too are...  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
I'm sorry... I was also ordered by my older sister to get rid of the wretches.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
So, well, I'd just like to state that this isn't what I want to do.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...A battle?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We can talk it out.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medusa:**   
I'm sorry, I can't resist.  
I'm sure my sister is watching us right now!  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
I won't ask you to forgive me.  
But anyways, I will make you face death!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
N-No, you can't!  
Senpai, Medusa is pretty serious!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We have to do it!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If you ask me, it can't be helped!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master!  
...Commencing anti-Servant combat!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Medusa:**   
...I lost.  
I surrender, you can take the treasure.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou♪  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The treasure chest.  
What do you think is inside?  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Congratulations♪  
Good job, you completed the trials I gave you, heroes♪  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
F-Fou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I-I see.  
You Rayshifted together with us.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And then took the trouble to come here, to hide...  
in the treasure chest...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What a mess!  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Our goddess!!  
   
**Mash:**   
...Ah, Senpai, this again...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Stheno:**   
As you can see, I was the treasure.Rejoice, Fujimaru. See, aren't you happy?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
WOW! I'm really happy!  
Wow, Lady Stheno!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou...  
  
  
## Really, It's Not Impossible?  
  
**Mash:**   
Hunt the wretches? ...Erm.  
Not even us will fall for that twice.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Don't misunderstand me. It's different from last time.  
The purpose of this request is different from before.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Specifically&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
..."The purpose is different." I should've properly understood what that meant last time.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In other words, you want to once again rope us into one of your games?  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Oh, wonderful.  
You are pretty smart, Mash.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, um...  
Your Charm skill isn't working on me...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If you really want to win me over, you shouldn't use the same logic as last time. Try a different&ndash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Understood, Goddess Stheno!  
I, Romani Archaman, will risk my life to get it done!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou fou!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Even you, Fou...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Lady Goddess!  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai, not again...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oh, brother.  
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh, so you're fine this time?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...So Stheno, are we on another hunt on the Shaped Isle?  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Yes, you're right. But this time,  
I really have an elaborate plan. Have fun♪  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's fun! I'm already having fun, our Goddess!  
Let's do it Mash, Fujimaru! Right now!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Noo...)  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Commence Rayshift!!  
Off you go to the 1st Century!!  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Be careful, both of you.  
This quest may be a bit difficult to complete, perhaps?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...We're here again.  
The Mediterranean island we've visited so many times...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Servant responses in the area... None detected.  
But we can't drop our guards.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Based on what happened last time, we have to consider the possibility Stheno is here, too.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's finish it ASAP.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The cave, right? Let's hurry.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's go, guys!  
According to Lady Stheno, she hid the treasure in a cave!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's that cave we entered before. You know where it is.  
Well, be on your way!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Every last word is the same...  
Doctor is completely taken by the Charm skill...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**???:**  
Gegege...  
I won't allow you to go any further...  
  
   
**???:**  
All for our beautiful goddess Lady Stheno... As Lady Stheno commanded, we must protect her treasure!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
...  
  
   
**???:**  
They seem speechless against our determination!  
Gegege...Then go home! Go on back home!  
  
   
**???:**  
Go home, go home!  
We won't give you the treasures, go home!  
  
   
**???:**  
Woooo! Lady Stheno, woooo!  
We won't forgive the intruders!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Identical, again...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's do it, Mash!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We can't waste their efforts!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-You're right. Understood, Master.  
Your orders, please!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
I-It was different...from last time?  
Instead of undead monsters, Chimera and Lamia...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She really changed her plans. Then, there's a chance the developments may change too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Some Heroic Spirit stronger than Medusa?  
But, what kind of Heroic Spirit&ndash;  
  
   
**F：???:**  
...I'm sorry.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!!  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
I am embarrassed to say, it's the same as last time.  
As my older sister said, "they won't see it coming"...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Servant Rider...Medusa.  
It is you, again.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
...Don't say it. It's hard for me, too.  
She ordered me to get rid of the treasure-hunting wretches once and for all.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
What can I say, erm, this time, it will really be hard.  
Do your best!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A battle, right?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I have...nothing left to say.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medusa:**   
I'm sorry, many many times.  
But, I won't ask you to forgive me.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
This time I'm really serious. Although I am on my sister's orders, but I'm still a Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
I can't afford to be defeated twice. Watch. This is the Gorgon-style Projection Killing Technique&mdash;  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
Named "Snake Magic" by my older sister.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
S-She split up!?  
   
**Medusa:**   
...Yes. Thank you very much for the expected reaction.  
To be honest, it's embarrassing, so you helped me.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
S-She's molting!?  
   
**Medusa:**   
...I split up. It's obviously a split.  
Molting? What do you think I am?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, Foou...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, it's not the time to chit chat!  
Visual impact aside, her power is real!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Multiple enemy Servants&mdash;  
Intercepting at full power, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Medusa:**   
Is that all you've got?  
I still have a lot of stamina left.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
Let's see. I still can molt&mdash;  
N-No, I can split twice more, you know?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hah, ah...I-It's endless, Senpai...  
Really, I'm almost...  
  
   
**???:**  
No, it is too early to give up,  
Mash, Fujimaru. Hah♪  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
B-Big Sister!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Stheno!?  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Huhuhu. The star always arrives late, right? To clean up a little sister's mishap is an older sister's duty.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
To punish Medusa, who's needlessly big and violent, the Goddess Stheno makes her beautiful appearance♡  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wha...What?!  
Stheno, are you on our side?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Aren't you protecting the treasure together with Medusa?  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
What are you saying, Mash.  
Right now I am Fujimaru's Servant.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
If someone is making Master suffer, I will get rid of her, mercilessly.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Sadly, even if she is my own little sister!  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
What, Big Sister!? The script was to summon Middle Sister, and all 3 of us would fight together, right!?  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Huhuhu. Did you honestly believe those words?  
You really have to train much more, Medusa.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Always doubt things that sound too good to be true, yes? Me, do something that would delight you? Such a thing&mdash;  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Has it ever happened, even once...!?  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
Ah...You are soooooo right!  
How convincing you are...!  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Come on, Fujimaru, let's fight!  
I've never had so much fun fighting a Servant before!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I do pity Medusa, but this must be the fate of those who meddle with goddesses...  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Medusa:**   
Uh...My split self's out of magical energy too...  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
Extremely...  
Tired...I used all I had...  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
Big Sister doesn't care about how much magical energy she uses...  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Heheh.  
Don't worry, I didn't consume any of mine.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
But it is really delightful.  
My original self doesn't have the strength to fight...  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
But I can fight if materialized as a Servant. A shame I didn't have this power during the Age of Myths.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I-It was a really valuable experience.  
Thank you very much, or rather...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm ti...red...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm somehow sleepy... Mash...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
A-Aah, Senpai!? That's right... You used more magical energy than you do in usual combat!  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
Yes. All the magical energy Big Sister used, it should have been all consumed from Fujimaru...  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
So, I'm sorry.  
I'm really sorry, if you die.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, hold on!  
Senpai...!  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Wait. I have to tell you before you pass out.  
Unfortunately, there is no treasure chest this time.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
It'd be boring if it was the same every time, right?  
I didn't want to disappoint you, but...  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
I found a different treasure.  
Sometimes it's good to fight like a tomboy.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Well, just like what "Euryale" said.  
...I can get used to this, heheh.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
So, I'll fight with everything I have next time, Master.  
Please make a full use of my even more charming Noble Phantasm.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
More important than that, Senpai!  
Senpai, get a hold of yourself!
