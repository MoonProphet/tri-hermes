## Gorgon's Bride  
  
**Medusa:**   
(sigh...)

**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's up?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medusa:**   
Oh, Fujimaru. Actually...I was offered a chance for an arranged marriage...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh-huh...Wait, did you say arranged marriage!?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
From whom!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medusa:**   
I have two older sisters, and they approached me about having a formal marriage interview.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
O-Okay...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So who are you meeting?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medusa:**   
Well, I don't think they're that serious about matchmaking.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
I have a feeling that they're just interested in my reactions...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can't you turn it down?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's turn it down!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medusa:**   
Sure..., but my sisters gave me a condition for turning it down...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...So, you and Senpai must pretend to be a couple.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hey, cheer up, Mash. It's just a performance, not like they're going to actually link their arms or kiss...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, maybe they should?  
Unless they do, they won't be seen as a couple.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
Uh, well, I don't know.  
You know, I'm not used to that kind of stuff...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Whew.  
Well, of course, not you of all people, Medusa.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
I'm not really happy either that you felt so relieved...  
I'm just not used to being in a relationship...  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
At any rate, I'm sorry, Fujimaru.  
For making you go through the extra trouble.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
[♂ I look forward to dating you. /♀️ Have you noticed that I'm a woman?}  
   
**Medusa:**   
[♂ Oh, me too. /♀️ Of course, but I don't mind actually...}

**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All right, let me shoot the video evidence.  
You back me up, Mash.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, understood.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
Hehe, I enjoy doing stuff like this once in a while.  
Though I'm sorry to trouble you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You don't have to be sorry.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'd rather be ready to enjoy it.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medusa:**   
Really?  
You have odd taste in things.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Now, now, Mash, it's high time you got over it.  
  
   
**Young Man:**   
Hey, lady. Look at your sexy body.  
Why don't you hang out with us?  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
...? Fujimaru, who are they talking about?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They're talking to you, Medusa.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hmm, this is so typical...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Young Man:**   
Heehee...I'm sure it'll be more fun to hang out with us than a kid like that.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
I'm sorry, but I'm enjoying my time with Fujimaru right now.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
I'd appreciate it if you could quickly disappear from my sight...  
  
   
**Young Man:**   
What the heck? What a snob...  
Hey, you guys. Teach her a lesson!  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
...Well. I may be used to it, but the fact that it's the same as always gives me a headache.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
I'm sorry, Fujimaru.  
Give me a little time to take out some trash.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Young Man:**   
Wh-What the hell...this woman...  
D-Damn it!! Boss!! Call the Boss!!  
  
   
**Boss:**   
Let me see... Ha!  
You can't even handle a woman and a few kids?  
  
   
**Young Man:**   
Yeah, but that woman's a "giant" with "crazy strength."  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
...(Humph)  
  
   
**Boss:**   
Tsk, letting a single woman have her way with you.  
Well, I do agree that small and cute girls are better.  
  
   
**Boss:**   
I'd turn down a "giant" like that even if she asked me out.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
...(Ticked)  
  
   
**Young Man:**   
Hehe! With our Boss here, we're not afraid of you any more!! Hey, guys!! Let's take her down!!  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
...Master.  
May I go all-out?  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
No, I'm not angry, I'm really not...  
It's just that my mystic eyes are aching.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, let's back her up...!!  
Oh, it looks like we don't need to do that.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Boss:**   
?!?!?! (Freeze)  
  
   
**Young Man:**   
Whoa!? Boss turned to stone?  
Dammit, I'm going to get you for this!  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
Whew... I lost my temper a little there.  
Fujimaru, I apologize.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't mind.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It happens.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medusa:**   
Hehe... you're a kind person.  
I appreciate your concern.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
Besides, you treat even someone like me like a normal person.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
Anyone who approached me would turn to stone, their faces twisted in horror...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Medusa...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The monster Medusa... The Gorgon...  
By the way, how do your sisters look...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor!  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
My sisters are very cute.  
They are not at all violent, unlike me.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're cute, too!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're close with your sisters, huh?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medusa:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
...Thank you, Fujimaru.  
I like being around you.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
I'm inexperienced, but let's get along from now too.
