# Scáthach  
  
## Kill Me If You Can  
  
**Scáthach:**   
...Now then. Are you ready, Cú Chulainn?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Ready or not. You haven't told me why I was summoned, but... Well, I have some idea.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm, being summoned like this must be fate. First off, I'd like you to try and finish me.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Uh, right. I just need to pierce through your heart or head with impeccable technique and coordination, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No! Wouldn't that just kill her?  
Um, we'd like you to not try and kill each other!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
That's impossible, little girl.  
At this point, nothing's going to stop her.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai, what should we do...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'd like the two of you to stop.  
   
**Scáthach:**   
No, please don't stop me, Master.  
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why do you want to die?  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Well, that's because living makes me long for death... A satisfactory death from the ultimate thrust.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I know it's too much too ask for and an annoyance. But this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I have a body which seeks but is denied death, a mere ghost who's burned onto the world.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
However, with this world incinerated, the Land of Shadows is no more. That's why I can be summoned as a Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
To fight as a warrior, to lose my life if defeated&mdash;  
A chance to live like a proper person.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Then it's only natural wanting to try it, no?  
Assuming there's a warrior greater than me.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Well, Cú Chulainn?  
Have you improved a bit since that time?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Since I couldn't leave the Land of Shadows, my only way to make sure was through my messengers.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Yes, a bit. Stand back, Fujimaru.  
A spear tip is more suitable for her than words.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
...Dammit. Sending clueless kids as messengers.  
What kind of bad joke is that?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
You are immortal physically, but your soul is dead. You're wise, but what you are is no different than a hellish fiend.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Now that very soul has materialized in this world, then I guess it's the pupil's job to finish his mentor off.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yes. Now then, Child of Light.  
Try to kill me for good this time.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Leave it to me. My spear can reverse causality, and it never misses its prey.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
&mdash;Here we go, Scáthach.  
That heart will be mine&mdash;!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Well said! My pupil, the moment that red spear pierces my chest&ndash;  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Oh, I have longed for such a moment...  
as I was frozen in the depths of eternity!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Sorry. I messed up.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Foolish pupil&mdash;!  
Why did your spear have to miss, now of all times!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Amazing... Gáe Bolg's tip flew way off into the horizon...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, it even seems to have left a contrail. It must have hit Mach speed.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see. Because it couldn't see Scáthach being dead in her fate, so it turned into a wild throw like that.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Ah. Is that what it is?  
So my foolish pupil did not go easy on me then.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Still! Come on, Sétanta! What's with you!?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
You've gotten worse since your time in the Land of Shadows! You're like a squirrel! Been slacking off on your training?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Yeah yeah, I know, I know... I am weaker than before.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I mean, half of my strength is missing.  
I don't really know why, but I am just not in my prime.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
What did you say?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh! Maybe... So when Cú Chulainn appeared as a Caster to help us that one time...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
His powers got distributed to every Cú Chulainn that existed in each Servant class.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Ew. I was a Caster somewhere?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I see. Come to think of it, despite being a natural warrior, his skill with runes was needlessly high...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Still, you told me something useful, Mash. There's still a chance.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Cú Chulainn. You will start your training over in that body. Train with a clear mind and you'll regain what you've lost.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A clear mind... So basically not to think about anything?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
...Wait, start over my training?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Did you hear it any other way, fool? You have the basics. Now you just need combat experience.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Right, it's decided.  
Now then, let's start our journey of training.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Huh, like right now? Ow! Don't pull the hair on the back of my head! Hey, Pink Hair! Quit laughing and do something!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Th-There they go.  
What do we do, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's follow them.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's join them.  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
You're right.  
It's our only option. Let's go!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Okay, we'll start by killing a chimera. Work hard.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
All right, I get it! Quit pulling my hair! ...Dammit. What a pain... But I guess I have to go along with it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wait, please!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Oh, you've decided to join our training?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The more of us, the better our chances.  
  
  
---  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...I see.  
You're right, we are Servants.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
They say a Servant's power increases more with backup from a Master.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
All right, I'll allow you to participate.  
Try to kill the chimera along with Cú Chulainn.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood!  
Let's do our best, Cú Chulainn!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
You sure love to stick your nose into other people's problems, but thanks. I can't shame myself in front of my mentor a second time.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Let's go, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Scáthach:**   
A life-or-death situation suits you, Cú Chulainn. Both your eyes are burning brightly, aren't they?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
That battle was intense, how can I not get excited? My love for a good fight has always been a bad habit of mine since childhood.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yes. However, your spear lacks precision.  
Did you hold back and rely on strength alone because the enemy was weak?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Didn't I teach you not to swing your spear with strength alone? Your habit of skipping out on lessons was one thing I couldn't fix...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
All right then, we're facing dragons next.  
Let's go earn you the title of Dragon Slayer... By killing a hundred of them.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
She's as unreasonable as he is!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Cú Chulainn, are you alive?  
...Which is to say, should we continue?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Of course we continue. My shoulder is all nice and warmed up. All right, bring on the dragon or whatever you've got!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Very well.  
Let us have at it, my prize pupil!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Last one.  
Here we go&ndash; Gáe Bolg!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Got 'em!  
Well? Can't complain about that!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Hello?  
Scáthach?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...No, sorry.  
I was remembering you from the past.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Stop right there before you embarrass me. So, what do you think?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hm... I don't know if it's perfect, but it's close. At the very least, not that much different when you were alive.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Good, now we're talking.  
Well, shall we do this?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Yeah, you're right.  
To think that kid would be standing before me like this.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Human life is nothing but wonders. Rather than becoming a god, I would have preferred to associate with you as a human&ndash;  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Heh, heh, that too is merely a luxury.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Something like “He who hunts two hares loses both.”  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Exactly.  
Are you ready, Cú Chulainn?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
&ndash;Yeah.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Mash, you two should join, too.  
Then we'll be even.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Gotta do it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Brace yourself.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood.  
...Here we go, Scáthach!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
&ndash;Come at me!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Ugh!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
&ndash;Gotcha!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Take this as my parting gift!  
Gáe Bolg!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
&ndash;Ugh!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
That was your last strike, huh?  
Then here goes... Gáe Bolg Alternative!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Wha...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
...Say, Scáthach.  
Looks like you, too...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Y-Yeah. Looks like...I also have gotten stronger than before.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Well, I had a hunch, but it was so fun... At times, killing dragons and giants and monsters...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Are you even more reckless than me!? Don't you want to die!?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I-I can't help it! The stronger an enemy, the more I want to see the essence of its strength.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
The stronger they are, the more I respect them, the more I want to cross swords with them!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
It's only natural that I'd end up getting stronger! It's not my fault!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...SIGH. Exactly how much does the Queen of the Land of Shadows love to fight?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I can't keep up with this inflation. She could at least slow the pace a little...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
It's not something that you can do in a short time.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
You're right.  
...No need to rush, is there?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Cú Chulainn and you, Fujimaru.  
The day will surely come when you can kill me.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Before you save the world,  
kill me, if only once.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
That is my wish.  
To that abysmal probability, I devote this body.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Yeah, yeah, I got it. We're stuck together 'till we both die... No, 'till we both kill each other.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
There's still a long way to go. Going along with a woman's selfishness is also a requirement to be a top-tier Master, Fujimaru.  
  
  
## Calls from the Land of Shadows  
  
**Mash:**   
...Master. Master.  
Please wake up. Master.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? What's going on?  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not sure myself. But we're not in Chaldea, nor any recognizable era.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What I do know&mdash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where are we...?  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not sure. What I do know&mdash;  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm detecting a great deal of magical energy here. Besides you and me...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Yo. You guys wandered in here too?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Cú Chulainn!  
Does that mean...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Must be Scáthach's doing. We've finally been invited into the Land of Shadows. I apologize on behalf of my mentor, since I'm kind of involved here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's nothing for you to apologize for...  
Oh, so this is the Land of Shadows?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
No, it's slightly different than the place I once visited.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
It's not the Isle of Skye. It's like a remnant of the Land of Shadows when it was still connected to the real world, but it's different somehow.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
The part where the air is filled with frigid magical energy is about right, though.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
...Which means, we were dragged into my mentor's memory, or something like that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Memory?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I'm not sure if this was deliberate or not, though.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Either way, even if this is just a memory, the Land of Shadows isn't somewhere we should linger.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
If things go badly, we'll all be swallowed up and die, including Master. The world will end, and we'll all end up in the gutter.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No...!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Eh, don't worry. This is just carelessness on her part.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
It wouldn't have been an issue if it was just me, but I can't let the both of you get sucked into this.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Which means, we need to exterminate that nuisance of a woman. Let's go take her out!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There are dead spirits floating around everywhere...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
The real Land of Shadows was close to the realm of the dead. Don't let them see you. They won't be friendly.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
O-okay.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Fou, you're here too!?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Oh come on, don't shout!  
...Oh crap.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...They've noticed us.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
...My bad.  
Well, we'll just call this more training...or something. Yeah.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Missy, don't let them take you down!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All right!  
Master, your orders!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Whew. You all right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. ...But why would Scáthach lure Master to the Land of Shadows?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Scáthach is pretty well beyond rational understanding or anything like that.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
From the looks of it, I don't think it's anything serious. She probably got a bit lonely.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
She's been stuck in this land for a few hundred years. There's nobody whom she could fight, let alone hate.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
A long time ago, ambitious fighters like me...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Came over to challenge the famed Scáthach to gain fame and glory, but she beat the crap out of every single one of us.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
...Aaand then we all ended up as her disciples...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Well, none of us could live forever.  
So this situation might be partly our fault.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What do you mean?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Our mentor trained the crap out of us.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Every one of us loved women and booze more than anything. We were a bunch of barbarians.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Scáthach would kick us around for being so rowdy, but it must have been fun for her.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
“The spirits of the dead would miss no chance to infiltrate the real world, but your ruckus has managed to frighten them away.”  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
That's what Scáthach would always lament.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
But we all had a place to go home to.  
The Land of Shadows was just a stop on our journey.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
And so, Scáthach's disciples all died young.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
...As for me, I turned up as a Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Come to think of it, I guess there was the option where we could have fought Scáthach in the Land of Shadows for eternity.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
But I chose not to. I think she may have resented me for that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I don't think that's true.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Maybe. I was just rambling. Ignore me.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
...Whoa, whoa. That's a sight. The castle gates are completely different than I remember.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
There weren't any knights in plate armor standing as gatekeeper, either. Hey Master, give us your orders!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, please!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Got 'em!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
They're easy compared to the Dragonkin we faced last time. Missy, how're you doing?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm fine!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Okay, then.  
Hey Scáthach! We're coming in!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
We know you're hiding in there!  
Brace yourself, we're coming in!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...There's no answer.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Well, we ARE in a memory...  
I'm not sure what's going on.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
And this might be late in the game, but in the Land of Shadows, the inside of the castle is far more dangerous than outside.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Mostly because fearless and clueless ghosts who want to challenge Scáthach are roaming around.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
We have to try to run. But, be prepared to fight.  
Okay, run!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, you run so magnificently!  
Fou, hold on tight!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I know!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A bunch of something are behind us!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
There are three up ahead. We can't evade them.  
We're charging in, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I've detected a strong magical energy reaction.  
And this sensation... Is this bloodlust?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
No. At least it's not her bloodlust.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Then what&mdash;  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...So it's you.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Hey, what the heck? Gathering all these spirits in one place, are you planning on forming an army or something?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
That's not a bad idea. I wouldn't have to keep my air of being aloof and reckless.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Stand down. Lifeless one.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
What the hell? It's not really like you to respond to my heckling, Scáthach.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Is that so? Many months and years have passed while I presided over the gates of this demonic land. I've seen many lives and deaths here.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I thought... I might as well rot.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
But this body never decayed. My soul was forever frozen, unchanged.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yet, my soul was always too...decent...to allow me to plunge into the morass of true evil.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
My desires faded, and my senses told only of silence and eternity.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...And then...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Humanity was incinerated. And with its absence, I gained the chance to end my eternity of monotony...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...the one in a million chance to finally be embraced by true death.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yet, I still do not know where my soul goes after death.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Is it to the Throne of Heroes? To the incinerated Land of Shadows? Or&mdash;  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Either way, I...desire. Through this body of ether, I have flesh and bones. Even a heart.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
And though it is temporary, I have “life” as a Servant.  
So, I find myself wanting to test it.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
No matter how much I try to hold back, I cannot contain it.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
As a result, I have involved Master and my foolish disciples in this debacle.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I apologize. Though, I know that may not be enough.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
What a roundabout way of doing things.  
...Fine. Let's give Scáthach her last rites.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Missy, Master. You ready?  
Scáthach is serious now.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
It's a sight rarely seen! Prepare yourself!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Then I shall die. Or perhaps, I shall kill.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Let's do this. I will try not to hold back!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Scáthach:**   
...That is some fight you put up.  
You have grown, all of you.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
It's over, Scáthach.  
If you've lost your wits, snap out of it.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I'm still not dead. You all are still alive.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Why do you stop? This fight is not yet over.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
There's no point in this, Scáthy-teach.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Killing you in a memory wouldn't make it real. That's just death within a fantasy. It'll only leave a bitter aftertaste.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
If you're going to die, do it in the real world.  
It should be an honorable death in battle, too, right?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Besides, why would you say you would TRY not to hold back!? That's not going all-out at all!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
If you really went all-out, you'd bring out a gate or two, not just your spear.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A gate...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
“Gate of Skye.” Have you seen it? It's a move where her enemies are dragged down into the Land of Shadows.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
At the bottom of the Land of Shadows, they're as good as dead. All living things simply perish.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
But then you don't even use it! If that's not holding back, what is, Scáthach!?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
H-hmmmmm...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Looks like I got you there.  
That's a once in a lifetime sight.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
...Is it because you're summoned as a Servant now? You're showing off a human side of yourself.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
But I guess that's partly due to Master's influence.  
After all, Master's the most human of all humans I know.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What do you mean?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is that a thing? That doesn't sound like a thing.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
It means you always try your best, as much as you're able. And anything you can't do, you still try to find a way.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
You borrow wisdom from those came before you, and dream of a future. No matter how dire the situation, and fight as humanly as possible.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
At times you may be discouraged. You may look back to the past. But stopping and looking back is only for a moment.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Right? Does that ring a bell?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...I suppose you have me there. I must have been affected by Master without realizing it.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
If not, you wouldn't be so feeble.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Eh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Scáthach...feeble?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I guess it's her way of life. Her desires aside, it's not like Scáthach to look back.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I think...I understand that logic.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Not only were her mannerisms different from the normal Scáthach, but her way of fighting...and everything else.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Oh, Missy is starting to understand the way of the Celts. So there you have it.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Scáthach. For you to desire death is just your way of trying to escape. And that isn't you at all.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Isn't it more like you to dream of a swift yet beautiful death as the reward of a glorious battle?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
You really didn't hold back there, Cú Chulainn.  
But you're right.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
For me to renounce everything and seek death at a time like this is nothing more than running from the truth.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Sheesh. Took you long enough.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
My apologies. And forget it.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...(Sigh) I cannot believe it...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
To allow you, of all people, to see my doubts.  
As a mentor, there is no greater disgrace.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hrm. In order to offset this disgrace, I may need you to die three times.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Now you're just taking it out on us!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Idiot. It's to clear my name. But since I wasn't falsely accused of anything, I simply need to overwrite my disgrace by doing something even more heinous.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Terrible. She really hasn't changed.  
But then again&mdash;  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Thanks to Master, I got to see a more human side of her. Let's just say that I had a valuable experience.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
&mdash;Hmph. You've grown bold, Child of Light.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I've had my fair share of turmoil.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I see. Then you may be the one who will eventually stand before me in battle.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Farewell, Cú Chulainn. It seems it'll be a while before your Gáe Bolg becomes the instrument of my grand end.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh look. The dead spirits have disappeared.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Sheesh. She left me with a hell of a demand.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
In order to end that woman's life, one would need the skills capable of killing even the gods.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Well anyway, why don't we go ahead and wake up, Master?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Scáthach and my desires aside, you've got a more crucial task up ahead of you.
