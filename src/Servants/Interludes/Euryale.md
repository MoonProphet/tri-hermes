# Euryale  
  
## From Me to My Sisters  
  
**Fou:**   
Fooou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Fou.  
We've been here&ndash;  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Hehehehe♪  
Yes, I see. So this is the place!  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
It's kind of strange, this feeling I have.  
But, part of me seems to be accepting it.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Yes, I see! In this place,  
something like this could happen.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
This is where "I" was.  
Hehe♪  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, my Goddess.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's right. "The Shaped Isle," I think she called it.  
We stopped by during our search for the Second Singularity.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
She&ndash;no, I mean "you,"  
or maybe it's better to say "all of you?"  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Either way, the landscape seems to differ from the island you and the rest of the Gorgon Sisters, used to live on.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Yes, it's very different.  
This is nothing like it.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
But they do have the sea in common.  
Yes, "I" was at the sea, was "I" not?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, my Goddess.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Hmm? What is it? Oh, right.  
You have my thanks, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Bringing me to the place where "I" was has made me very happy. I mean it.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
So I'll give you a reward.  
You see the cave entrance by those rocks&ndash;?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's the cave Stheno told us to go into.  
Dangerous monsters lived, no, were placed there.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Second Singularity, 1st century Rome, is already repairing itself, but it might still be dangerous.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That phantasmal might still be there.  
It's better to stay away.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Hmm? What is it? I can't hear you.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
I'm curious to see what kind of trial  
"I" gave you.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
So...  
Please, Fujimaru♪  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, that's&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, my Goddess.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai?  
What's gotten into you? You're acting strange.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooooou...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
From the look of it,  
she's using some kind of Divine Authority?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But if she's using something of that nature,  
I think I'd be able to detect the magical energy...  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
You're silly, Mash. I am a goddess.  
A goddess who was born only to be loved.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Even as a Heroic Spirit and a Servant,  
my divine core does not change.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
So...hehe!  
It's natural for Fujimaru to fall in love with me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
What is it?  
You look like you want to say something.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
N-No...  
I don't...  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Oh, really? Are you sure about that?  
I see. I see. Hehe.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
You're cute, for a human,  
Mash Kyrielight.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, my Goddess.  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooouuuuuuuuuuuu...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, jeez... I guess you're going into those caves.  
There isn't any treasure in there, though.  
  
   
**???:**  
GAAAAAAAA!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I sensed magical energy the instant we entered!  
Senpai!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What did I tell you? There's still a phantasmal here. Is it a chimera? I bet it's a chimera. Those things are strong!  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Oh my! What an ugly, fierce, miserable beast!  
It's not fair! I didn't know there was all this fun here!  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Where did "I" find such a monster, I wonder?  
I want one too!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's going to eat us before you can keep it as a pet! Here it comes!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, your orders!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, my Goddess.  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai! Jeez!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's definitely some kind of charm!  
Completely under her spell!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fou, bite Fujimaru!  
Then we can fight!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fo&ndash;uuuu!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Did you come to your senses now?  
It's time for battle! Give me your orders!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Euryale:**   
Whew, that was fun.  
I'm not supposed to be this strong, you know.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Did assigning her an accurate Servant class make her stronger?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Either way, yeah.  
Good work&ndash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, wait. There's more!  
This time there's lots! Lots more!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash, continue combat!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Euryale:**   
There was some weird snake, too, huh?  
I already have plenty of snakes.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You do?  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Oh&mdash;Ahem. No, nothing, Mash.  
Anyway, this cave is tiny. Are we at a dead end already?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, if this was a real labyrinth I would've opposed coming in here. Goddess, I'm glad your sister went easy on us during that trial...  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
I see.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
...Here it is. So this is what "I" was doing.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What's wrong?  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
...Nothing.  
I've seen what I came to see. Let's go.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
???  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? What? Was something there?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What did you see?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Were you looking at something?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Euryale:**   
It's nothing&ndash;  
Oh, jeez. Now even Fujimaru wants to know...  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Don't worry about it.  
I just found something I expected to find.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
A message that "I" left for me.  
Or maybe a message that "I" left for her.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
It's nothing.  
Really.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
If by some chance, or miracle,  
she and I were to manifest in the same era...  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
That's impossible of course, but if it was possible...  
And then we never saw each other...  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
This was a short message from "me,"  
just in case that ever happened.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
She told "me" to never change.  
And for "you" to never change either.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
...Wait, why are you making me say this?  
You're a cheeky human, Fujimaru!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm sorry, my Goddess.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sorry for overstepping myself, Goddess.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, again!?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Some resistance to her charm should be present, but her spell is truly irresistable.  
That's what makes that Goddess so amazing.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Of course.  
I'm a Goddess, beloved by all.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
All you have to do is love me.  
Just adore me from afar.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Don't even think about peeking at me or inside of me.  
Otherwise&ndash;"a beautiful snake" will bite you!
