# Bradamante  
  
## Dear Ancestor!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
!!!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
(Master, Master!)  
  
**Bradamante:**   
(Look, over there! Can you believe it!?  
That's Lord Hektor!)  
  
**Bradamante:**   
(This is amazing!  
Lord Hektor is an absolute legend!)  
  
**Bradamante:**   
(He's one of the great heroes of the Trojan War, and one of the Nine Worthies spoken about in hushed tones throughout all of history!)  
  
**Bradamante:**   
(He's also my and Ruggiero's ancestor!  
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh...)  
  
**Bradamante:**   
(All this time I've been here, and I still haven't introduced myself properly... Oh gosh!)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's okay. Just try to relax.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
(Exhale)... (Inhale)...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
(Exhaaaleee)...  
Okay, I'm feeling a little calmer now!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Thank you, Master. This is the perfect chance to talk to him. I can't let it go to waste.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why not go rectify that now?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
...Okay, Master. If you think that's a good idea,  
then that's just what I'll do.  
  
---  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Here goes nothing!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
U-um, excuse me!  
  
**Hektor:**   
Hm?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Y-you there, the one with the shining helmet! Are you Lord Hektor, the great hero of the Trojan War!?  
  
**Hektor:**   
Hmm...  
  
**Hektor:**   
I don't know about the “great hero” part, but if you're looking for Hektor of Troy, you've found him.  
  
**Hektor:**   
So what's up, little Bradamante?  
What can your old ancestor here do for you?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Well, you see, um...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
I still haven't introduced myself properly since coming to Chaldea, so, um, I wanted to rectify that.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
It's a pleasure to meet you in person, Lord Hektor!  
  
**Hektor:**   
Hey, thanks. Pleasure's all mine.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Um, I was also wondering if, maybe...  
  
**Hektor:**   
Yes?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
I-if you wouldn't mind, um, maybe...you'd like to join Master and me...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
...for tea!? Or some other beverage!?  
  
**Hektor:**   
Tea, huh? Hmm...  
Well, it's not like I don't have time, but...  
  
**Hektor:**   
(Honestly, I don't think we'd have all that much to  
talk about. But I can also see Master standing behind  
her with [♂ his /♀️ her] hands clasped together begging me to say  
yes, so...)  
  
**Hektor:**   
Sure, why not? Nothing wrong with the occasional cup of tea, especially for happy occasions.  
  
**Hektor:**   
'Course, we didn't have tea back in this old man's time, so drinking was pretty synonymous with alcohol.  
  
**Hektor:**   
Alcohol lasts forever, and it's high in nutrients, too. Plus, not every area has plenty of clean, fresh water to go around, you know?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Right! That's how the Kingdom of the  
Franks used to be! Well, really...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Didn't that pretty much used to be the case everywhere?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Yes, that's what I've been told!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So alcohol wasn't always a luxury good then.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Not at all. It was once as common and essential to daily life as bread.  
  
---  
  
**Hektor:**   
So that's how it was back in the Kingdom of the Franks too, huh. So, does that mean you didn't have tea parties back in your time, either?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
That's right! We didn't!  
  
**Hektor:**   
I see.  
(So why do you seem so happy about that?)  
  
**Bradamante:**   
I occasionally got to enjoy Chinese tea whenever I'd meet with Lady Angelica of Cathay...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
...but we never had any cultural traditions surrounding tea of our own!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Back then, tea ceremonies and parties and whatnot were still very limited to the East.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Tea didn't become a cultural fixture in Europe until...  
Hmm, let me think...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
I think Holland was the country that popularized green tea...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
...and the British Empire did the same for black tea relatively recently.  
  
**Hektor:**   
The British Empire, huh?  
  
**Hektor:**   
Hmm... Was that the one that started  
in the Isles of Britannia?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
That's right!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Back when I was alive, it was known far and wide as the prosperous Kingdom of England.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
It's also where Stolfo&ndash;I mean, Astolfo, one of the Twelve Paladins, was born.  
  
**Hektor:**   
That Rider with the pink hair, huh?  
Well, whaddaya know.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
In fact, he's actually a prince to England's royal family, though most of us tend to forget that, including him.  
  
**Hektor:**   
No kidding! A prince so scatterbrained he even forgets he's a prince, huh? Hahaha, that's priceless!  
  
**Hektor:**   
I know a scatterbrained prince myself, but it sounds like that one handily takes the cake, amazingly.  
  
**Hektor:**   
Something tells me we'd get along nicely.  
  
**Paris:**   
Achoo!  
  
**Paris:**   
(Sniffle) That's weird.  
Can Servants even catch colds?  
  
**Nightingale:**   
A cold, is it?  
Well that won't do at all, Paris.  
  
**Nightingale:**   
You might need to get a shot.  
Come with me so I can take a look at you.  
  
**Paris:**   
Aw maaan...  
  
**Hektor:**   
The Kingdom of England, aka the British Empire from the Isles of Britannia, huh.  
  
**Hektor:**   
Wait. Aren't the Isles of Britannia where&ndash;  
  
**Bradamante:**   
...Yes.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Britain is the island where Prince Aeneas of Troy's descendants ended up settling down.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
And it's where they went on to found the glorious Kingdom of Britain.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
But a few hundred years later...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
...the last king of Britain, Arthur Pendragon,  
King of Knights, lost his final battle...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
...and after the Saxons migrated, the Kingdom of Britain&ndash;  
  
**Hektor:**   
That was when the last vestiges of Trojan lineage vanished from the face of the Earth. Right?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
...  
  
**Hektor:**   
Well hey, what do they say in the East?  
Land outlasts kingdoms?  
  
**Hektor:**   
Just because a nation is gone doesn't mean its people disappear. Not to mention its land, oceans, and rivers all stick around, too.  
  
**Hektor:**   
It's no different with feelings. Losing a war sucks, but it doesn't mean everything's gone forever.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Like, say...  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Bradamante and Ruggiero.  
  
---  
  
**Bradamante:**   
...Hey, yeah!  
  
**Hektor:**   
There you go. Troy might've lost spectacularly and faded away, but you're still here.  
  
**Hektor:**   
And just look at how well you and this old man's other descendants turned out.  
  
**Hektor:**   
I'm relieved, really. It feels good to see your blood, sweat, and tears still be around in later generations.  
  
**Hektor:**   
Really, when you think about it, what would it say about us if we let a little war or two eradicate us completely?  
  
**Hektor:**   
That's it.  
I can tell you grew up strong, little Bradamante.  
  
**Hektor:**   
...That being said.  
  
**Hektor:**   
All of that goes out the window when we're talking about all of humanity possibly being destroyed.  
  
**Hektor:**   
Man, as if dealing with a single nation going away wasn't enough of a pain in the neck.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
You're right!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
We can't let anyone bleach all of human life away!  
We have to restore humanity, no matter what!  
  
**Gareth:**   
...  
  
**Gareth:**   
...Oh gosh, that conversation between Sir Hektor and Lady Bradamante I happened to overhear was so inspiring!  
  
**Gareth:**   
Now what am I going to do?  
  
**Mordred:**   
Jack shit, that's what.  
  
**Mordred:**   
You shoulda just kept on walkin', but instead,  
you had to stop and hide like some kinda idiot.  
  
**Gareth:**   
Don't call me an idiot!  
  
**Mordred:**   
I'll call you whatever the hell I want, idiot!  
  
**Gareth:**   
Can't you tell I'm trying to be considerate and not interrupt their conversation!?  
  
**Gareth:**   
Also! Doesn't Lady Bradamante...  
  
**Gareth:**   
...remind you of me?  
  
**Mordred:**   
...You think?  
  
**Gareth:**   
I can just tell she's a really hard worker, you know?  
  
**Gareth:**   
And Sir Lancelot, hehe, has praised me directly for my work ethic! More than once, even!  
  
**Gareth:**   
So we're basically two peas in a pod!  
  
**Mordred:**   
Haaa?  
(Special Translation: You really think so?)  
  
**Hektor:**   
Hm? Something wrong?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
I sensed somebody watching us!  
  
**Hektor:**   
Eh, now that you mention it, I can feel a few eyes on us. Ah well, it's probably just some of our Chaldea compatriots, so I don't think it's anything to&ndash;  
  
**Bradamante:**   
You! Are you watching us?!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Yes, you! Don't bother trying to hide!  
Come on out where we can see you!  
  
**Man in Shadow:**   
Oh, uh...  
  
**Man in Shadow:**   
I wasn't trying to hide, I promise. I was just kinda...stuck. ('Cause it was too awkward to go out.)  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
But I don't want to give you the wrong impression, so...  
I'm sorry.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
I know you!  
You're Mandricardo!  
  
**Hektor:**   
Is that so.  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
...!  
  
**Hektor:**   
Hm?  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
I-I... Um...  
H-hey.  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
I, uh, I really wasn't trying to eavesdrop, I promise. I just happened to pass by, that's all.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
...  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
...  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
...Uh, yeah, so.  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
I've got, uh, you know, training and stuff, so...  
I'll get out of your hair now.  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
...  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
...  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
Um... Can I ask you something?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Of course!  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
Why're you following me? I was planning on training alone today (read: like always), so...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
...Are you sure?  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
I'm sure.  
  
**Hektor:**   
I'm only here 'cause Bradamante and Master grabbed my hands and dragged me here, by the way.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
(Gasp) I-I-I-I'm so sorry, Lord Hektor!  
I wasn't even thinking!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
I was just so anxious, and you're just so f-fatherly that I grabbed your hand without realizing.  
  
**Hektor:**   
Hey, I get it.  
That kind of thing just happens sometimes.  
  
**Hektor:**   
So, anxious, huh? I didn't know you cared about Mandricardo that much.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
I... I, uh...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Ummm...  
Well...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is it, Bradamante?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You know, you do seem kind of...fixated on Mandricardo.  
  
---  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Well, um... How can I put this...  
Gnnn!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do you two know each other or something?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Weren't you guys enemies when you were alive?  
  
---  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Yes, we did.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
King Mandricardo of the Tatars is the son of King Agrican, who was killed by the de facto leader of the Twelve Paladins, Roland!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
He came across Lord Hektor's shield and armor over the course of his travels, and then tried to get his hands on the legendary sword Durendal...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
...so that he could complete one of the Nine Worthies' armor sets and go after Roland, holder of said sword, to avenge his father's death!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
In short, he's the paladins' sworn enemy!  
Which is why I...!  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
...  
  
**Hektor:**   
Sworn enemy? Really?  
  
**Hektor:**   
C'mon, that was a long time ago, right? Not to mention it was back when you were both still alive.  
  
**Hektor:**   
Now you're both Servants&ndash;shadows of humanity sworn to serve the same Master.  
  
**Hektor:**   
Do you really need to bring old quarrels into Chaldea, especially after they've long been dead and buried?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
(Gasp of realization)  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Y-you're right...  
It's just as you say, Lord Hektor!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
I'm so sorry, King Mandricardo. I was way out of line.  
I hope you can forgive my foolish behavior.  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
Uh, it's okay. Don't worry about it.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Of course you're not our sworn enemy.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Our only sworn enemies are Morgan the Witch, Great King Agramante, and Demogorgon the Demon God!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
What you are, King Mandricardo, is...  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
Yeah...?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Our rival!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
You were the powerful warrior king who went toe to toe with both Ruggiero and Roland!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
You were a fearsome rival in every sense of the word, and I owe you an apology for ever insinuating otherwise!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Heartily nod in assent)  
  
---  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
I-I, uh... I'm not really sure what you're going on about, but...  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
S-so you consider me your rival, huh?  
Well, thanks. That's nice of you.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Once again, I ask that you please forgive my foolish behavior, King Mandricardo!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
If there is anything I can do to make it up to you, anything at all, please don't hesitate to let me know!  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
...Uh, that's okay.  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
Really, you don't have to worry about it.  
It's fine.  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
(At this point, I just wanna hurry up and get back to my room already...)  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
Having you apologize all over the top and formal like this is honestly weirding me out more, so... Let's just let bygones be bygones, all right?  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
...  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
(D-damn, talk about a radiant smile...)  
  
**Bradamante:**   
So you forgive me!!!?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Oh thank you, King Mandricardo! I had no idea you were such a kind and magnanimous man.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
If only Ruggiero had had a chance to get to know you, I'm sure he would have also&ndash;  
  
**Energetic Voice:**   
I see how it is!  
  
**Hektor:**   
Hm? Isn't that&ndash;  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Who goes there!?  
  
**Energetic Voice:**   
Yesterday's enemy!  
  
**Energetic Voice:**   
Is today's friend!  
  
**Energetic Voice:**   
That's just what's going on here, right?  
What a wonderful expression!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Gareth!  
  
**Gareth:**   
That's right! It's me, Gareth!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Uh-oh. If you're here in full armor, does that mean  
  
**Gareth:**   
Hehehehe, your instincts are spot on, Master.  
  
---  
  
**Gareth:**   
Thanks to a series of increasingly unlikely coincidences, I heard everything while I was passing by! Just sit back and leave this all to me!  
  
**Hektor:**   
Uh, there's really nothing to leave, since we're not arguing anymore...  
  
**Gareth:**   
Lady Bradamante...in the spirit of deepening our  
friendship, what would you say to a lancing duel!?  
  
**Hektor:**   
Uh, I really don't think there's any need to go to that kind of trou&ndash;  
  
**Bradamante:**   
!!!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
That...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
...sounds like a wonderful idea!  
Would you be willing to join us, King Mandricardo!?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
I would love to try sparring with you and Lady Gareth!  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
N-nah, I'm good... (Glance)  
  
**Bradamante:**   
(Glance)  
  
**Gareth:**   
(Glance)  
  
**Hektor:**   
Why're you all looking at me!?  
  
**Hektor:**   
Don't worry about me. You're all young and full of pep, so go ahead and act like it.  
  
**Hektor:**   
I'll just be over here watching from the side&ndash;  
  
**Bradamante:**   
(Lord Hektor!?)  
  
**Gareth:**   
(The great hero of Troy!?)  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
(Lord Hektor, one of the Nine Worthies...  
is going to watch me!?)  
  
**Mandricardo:**   
I don't have a lance, but will a wooden sword do!?  
  
**Gareth:**   
Of course!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Certainly!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Master! I know this is short notice, but would you be so kind as to lend me your aid!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You got it!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Gareth and Mandricardo vs. Bradamante and me, huh? Let's do it!  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Here goes!  
Noble Phantasm, True Name release...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Bouclier d'Atlante!!!!  
  
**Narration:**   
...And, that was how it went.  
  
**Narration:**   
After they finished working up a good sweat in the simulated training battle...  
  
**Narration:**   
...the youngsters all went on to take a tea break together, or so I'm told.  
  
**Narration:**   
As for this old man, just listening in on their conversation is enough for me.  
  
**Narration:**   
Turns out, there's something kind of nice about your descendants laughing and having fun with new friends.  
  
**Narration:**   
Even a twisted, scruffy old man like  
me can't help but crack a smile.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Lord Hektor!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
What are you doing over there in the corner?  
Come join us! Everyone's dying to talk to you!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Come on, over here!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Go on, Hektor. It'll make their day.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's too soon for you to think about retiring just yet, Hektor!  
  
---  
  
**Hektor:**   
...Well, all right. If you insist, Master.  
  
**Hektor:**   
I guess I can tell you all one of my Aias stories.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
!!!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
J-j-j-just a moment! Y-y-y-you mean you were friends with Aias the Great, Lord Hektor!?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Oh my gosh! Then we need to get King Iskandar and Alexander down here, too!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh!
