# Arash  
  
## Lonely Soldier, Brave As a Lion  
  
**Arash:**   
...We've got barely any equipment. Be careful, okay?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
You need to prepare to go into the forest.  
You can't just walk in there.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
But, well, I guess this isn't a real forest, right?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, this is a battle simulation.  
I want combat data for forested areas, you see.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So I thought bringing a veteran Heroic Spirit would be good experience for Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
What an honor. My job is keeping Fujimaru from being too reckless, right?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
It'll be hard to take it slow, but I am sure you'll get something out of this.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks!  
   
**Arash:**   
Yeah, leave it to me.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's just you and me this time.  
   
**Arash:**   
That's right.  
Let's do this.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'll be watching the Command Room this time.  
Sorry, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
B-But I'll help in any way I can!  
I'll watch for any enemies that might show up!  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Hmm? Can't you guys make enemies appear and disappear?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Nah, it would be boring doing that every time.  
This time I had them appear randomly.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So if you tell them where the enemies are, all that programming work I did will be wasted...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, Doctor. Just think of this as practice for providing support from the Command Room.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But is there any point in you doing that?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We're training to be ready for everything. Isn't that right, Doctor?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm counting on you.  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you, I'll do my best!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Next time, you will come too.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes! I'd love to!  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Sorry, missy, I'll be borrowing your Master for a little.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I'll get your Master back safe... Wait a second.  
You don't get hurt in a combat simulator, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right, but serious injury will result in minor psychological trauma...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That goes for Servants too.  
Arash, please be careful.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I'll be fine. I'll protect your Master for you.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is practice for fighting without Mash, too.  
Though Mash will always be with you during Rayshifts...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...it's quite possible that you two will get separated upon arrival.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's hard to imagine me leaving Senpai's side, but&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But you're right. We can't be sure it won't happen.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's true.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. If we ever Rayshift into space, it will take us some time to rendezvous.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll never leave you, Mash.  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you, Senpai.  
I'll try my best to stay with you always...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Arash:**   
Hmm... What was it? It's...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Arash, is something wrong?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I think there's a phrase to describe you two.  
It's on the tip of my tongue.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Deeply connected? Best friends?  
No, no, no. Um, let me see.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Deeply in love?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-Arash!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe...he's right?  
   
**Mash:**   
Not you too!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Y-You're making me blush!  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes, um...well...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Arash:**   
It's important, right?  
A Master and Servant are&mdash;  
  
   
**Arash:**   
No, I guess not. It doesn't matter whether you're human or not.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
You're comrades, risking your lives together.  
It's best for you to get along.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes. But wait, that doesn't just go for me...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...but for all the Servants who've contracted with Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You too, Arash. We're all comrades, risking our lives together, right?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Huh? Yeah... you're right.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Come to think of it, you're right.  
Haha, I tried to act cool, and it failed, huh?  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
...Arash is a great man.  
Many know his name.  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
Many know his deeds as well.  
Even today he is widely respected in Western Asia.  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
His name and achievements are carved in legends, and sung in songs.  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
Yes, song.  
Did you not know this, Master?  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
The song survives to the present day.  
Shall I sing a little?  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
“He&mdash;”  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
“He stood on the top of Mount Damavand, and readied the arrow of fate.”  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
“His name was Arash, and the rising sun was his friend.”  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
“...The generals sing of his victory.”  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
“Strong, pure Arash, with all of his life, fired but a single arrow.”  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
“Two countries were engulfed in the flames of war, and with his arrow he saved them both.”  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
“All eyes were shocked as his deed, and his bravery became a legend.”  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
“His arrow was faster than the fastest comet.”  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
“Afterwards he was never seen, and his name alone became legend.”  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
“The other side of the Oxus River became the new border. By its clear waters both countries built peace.”  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
“He is Arash, the strong and pure. A lonely warrior. Arash, bold like a lion.”  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
I changed a bit, but it was mostly like this...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...A lonely warrior?  
  
  
---  
   
**Serenity:**   
Yes. Thus it is said.  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
Arash was the great hero of Western Asia.  
He lived and fought alone, they say, in the distant past.  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
...The truth however, is unknown.  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
A legend is a legend. It does not always represent the truth.  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
Records are the same way. They are not absolute.  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
I cannot say for sure...  
But...  
  
   
**Arash:**   
What's wrong, Master? Space out in the forest and you'll walk right into a tree.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Don't drop your guard even in a battle simulation, or else you'll get hurt. Even here, you'll go numb, right?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
It's not just trees you'll be running into.  
There's beasts and monsters about too.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Monsters?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Like chimeras and stuff?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Arash:**   
Yeah, a forest is nature's home.  
So of course, there are monsters here.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
The mages would call it... “Mystics,” was it?  
They may be rare, but monsters are a part of nature.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
They were common in my day.  
The king I served was a descendant of a dragon slayer.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A dragon?  
   
**Arash:**   
That's right, and a strong one, too.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...A wyvern, or something?  
   
**Arash:**   
You mean the subspecies of western dragons?  
No, I think it was worse than that.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Arash:**   
Real dragons are rare, but they do exist out there.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
They say there aren't many left these days, but the Rayshifts send you to the past, right?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
So stay focused in the forest. Mash, the Doctor, and the other Servants can protect you.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
You're the core of the battle, Fujimaru. We need your power to summon Heroic Spirits and use Command Spells.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Win or lose, it's up to&mdash;  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Your orders... Whoa!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I've detected random monsters!  
Wait, some have already been defeated?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Arash's Arrow Construction skill!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He was blessed by the goddess Armaiti, and is a legendary bowyer too!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He can make and fire arrows using magical energy in real time!  
  
   
**Arash:**   
There's your explanation.  
They're coming, Master! Let's do this!  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Give me your orders. First we take some out, and then...  
  
   
**Arash:**   
We retreat as fast as we can.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Retreat?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Couldn't we just wipe them out?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Arash:**   
They're random monsters. There's probably no need to, but...  
  
   
**Arash:**   
If these things are “natural,” then a larger pack might be nearby.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
It's like seeing an enemy scout.  
There might be an army nearby.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Always go into training like it's the real deal!  
Picture the risks you might face on the battlefield!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You may be right!  
   
**Arash:**   
Haha! Right?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Aren't we just tiring ourselves out for nothing?  
   
**Arash:**   
Hahahaha! Come on, don't be like that!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Arash:**   
First, we fight! Then we retreat at top speed! Let's go!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Arash:**   
...The sun's set.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
The forest can be a little rough at night.  
You'd feel better with some light, right?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hold on a second.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I ran so fast I'm out of breath.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Arash:**   
Yeah, take some rest. We ran, but that doesn't mean we've escaped from the enemy.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
To survive in the forest, you need water, food, and a safe place to rest.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
It's different than fighting in battle.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
We've got some water and food, yeah?  
Not a lot, since this is a simulation.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I can keep us safe. There are no enemies around, and even if one randomly appears...  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I'll protect us.  
Until you're ready for combat.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks.  
   
**Arash:**   
It's fine. I'm your Servant, you know.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can you see what's around us?  
   
**Arash:**   
Sure can.  
I've got “good eyes.”  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry to keep dragging this out.  
I'm worried about Fujimaru's stamina.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But I want some night combat data too, so I hope you don't mind keeping this up.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Don't push yourself too hard, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I have a real dinner prepared.  
It'll be waiting for you when you're done.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Looking forward to it.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai. So am I.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Simulator food is flavorless.  
   
**Arash:**   
You're right. These are called rations, right?  
They're not bad...  
  
   
**Arash:**   
But not good either. I miss beer.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Arash:**   
I've started a fire, don't get cold.  
Lie down and rest if you want.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Rest when you can. Eat when you can. Even outside the forest, keep that in mind in order to fight.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I'm sure you know that by now, yeah?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
You've Rayshifted many times already.  
You've retrieved many Grails from many eras.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I guess I have a lot of experience.  
   
**Arash:**   
Yeah, it's impressive.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It doesn't seem real to me.  
   
**Arash:**   
Doesn't it? ...No, maybe that's just how it is.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Arash:**   
Fujimaru, can I ask you something?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
You've fought a long time, right?  
Trying to save the world.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
How are you doing? Are you feeling tired?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's kind of rough.  
   
**Arash:**   
...I see.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
That's right. It's okay to say how you're feeling.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can still keep going!  
   
**Arash:**   
...I see.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Don't push yourself too hard, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
You may be the only Master who can Rayshift, but well, you know...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Arash:**   
There's a limit to how much a single person can do.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
You have your Servants. You have Roman and Da Vinci at Chaldea.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
And... you have Mash. She's your partner, and she worries about you more than anyone.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
So don't try to do everything by yourself.  
When things get tough, you can say so.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
It's not as if you're fighting alone.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I've got you, too.  
   
**Arash:**   
Yeah, that's right.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I'm here, too. If you need me, I'll be your strength.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
If you're saving the world, I'll be at your side with my bow.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay, all set to go! The last attack isn't random, it comes with advance notice!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I've prepared something special to finish off the simulation! Get ready, you two!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's time, Senpai!  
The last battle of the day!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Is this coming from your experience?  
   
**Arash:**   
...Maybe it is.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
When I was still alive on Earth...  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I tried to do everything myself.  
I tried to save everything myself.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
The slain, their killers, plunderers, their victims. Everything. Everyone on the earth I could see.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
...I tried to save the world.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
The world was still so small back then.  
So I told myself that maybe I could do it.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I was formed from remnants of the Age of Gods.  
I'm tougher than a human, and I possess some Mystics.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
My limbs. My eyes. My knowledge.  
The Goddess gave me many things.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I fought. I fought alone, under the banner of the dragon-slaying king...  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I kept fighting, to end a war that lasted decades.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Both my king's nation and the enemy were exhausted.  
A mess.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Nobody wanted to fight anymore.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
So I ended it.  
By myself.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
The king's people, the enemy's people, everyone wanted to end it, and I...  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I created it, their last chance.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
...I did it alone.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
The king was worried about me, but in the end, I had subordinates but no friends.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
There was no one I could call a comrade.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I chose to be alone myself.  
Being born more than a human, it's only natural.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Why, you ask? It's simple.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
To me, humans were people I had to protect.  
So I kept my distance from them.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
...And in the end, I was alone.  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
I cannot say for certain...  
However...  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
“He is Arash, the strong and pure. A lonely warrior. Arash, bold like a lion.”  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
The man I saw seems to be the exact same person who's still celebrated throughout the ages.  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
I can't be certain, and I have no proof.  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
But I think... he was so much greater a hero than any mortal man could be...  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
He was too strong. He was too pure.  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
Because of that, none could stand at his side.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
...My bad. That was a pretty deep conversation.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Hmm? What is it? You've got a strange look on your face.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay, all set to go! The last attack isn't random, it comes with advance notice!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I've prepared something special to finish off the simulation! Get ready, you two!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, d-don't interrupt them now!  
This is important!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Arash:**   
Looks like our break's over, Fujimaru. They gave us fair warning. Now's the time to get on your feet.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I wonder what it'll be, maybe that dragon subspecies?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I'll take on a sphinx or a Demon God Pillar too.  
No way am I gonna lose to some soulless data!  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Now, give me your orders!  
Let's give it all we've got, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
I am not picking up any more enemies.  
You've won, Senpai!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can't believe you beat them so quickly...  
You're amazing, Senpai! Arash, too!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? Did I screw up the data settings?  
I don't think I did...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyway, good work! I still have to analyze it, but I think this is good data!  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Whew...I'm glad that's over.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good work, Arash.  
   
**Arash:**   
Yeah, you too.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Next time, let's fight together for real.  
   
**Arash:**   
Yeah, if you need me!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Arash:**   
...But it's strange, you know.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
This is probably the third time I've fought to save the world. No, maybe the fourth?  
  
   
**Arash:**

It looks like I've got good luck with Masters.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I'm glad to be by your side. If you need my help, I'll always give everything I've got.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
More so than when I was alive!  
  
   
**Arash:**   
...Let's save the world, Master!
