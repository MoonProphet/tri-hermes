# Frankenstein  
  
## The Events of a Lonely Night in November I  
  
**Fran:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fran, are you all right?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's another artificial human like Fran in this era...  
Was Chaldea's analysis really correct?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We're a long way from both London,  
and Victor Frankenstein's house...  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuuh...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fran doesn't seem to know either...  
But let's look anyway.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, Fran.  
Wake Master up, please.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'll go look around and then meet up with you both.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuh!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Everything seems normal.  
Okay, now to meet up with Master&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
W-What happened here&ndash;!?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uuhh!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um... Master didn't get up,  
so you were worried it was a terrible illness.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Then you decided to give electroshock therapy,  
and fired off Blasted Tree... Right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Isn't that a really bad idea&ndash;!?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuh?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I thought I was done for.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
My life flashed before my eyes...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm glad you're alive.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's okay, Fran.  
Master isn't mad.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuh?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's right. I'm not.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Be careful from now on.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuuuuuh...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like she understands.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, we're almost at our destination.  
See any responses?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm... That's strange.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I momentarily detected strong magical energy just now,  
but it's already gone.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There's traces left, but they're starting to vanish.  
By the time you get there they'll be gone.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Some kind of summoning ritual?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm not sure... I don't have enough to say either way.  
I don't see enemy bio-responses, so don't worry.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uuh? Uuuuuhh...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fran, what's wrong?  
...You saw something strange over there, you say?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is... Something was buried here.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's take a look.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuuuuhh...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is there something here?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuh, uh.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Under the ground?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What...? A voice!?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuuuuhhhhhh!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
W-Wait!  
You shouldn't dig there! Bad idea!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, what's down there!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's a human corpse!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's not human... It's a homunculus?  
And...it's still alive!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuuh&mdash;!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It was dead just a moment ago,  
with no trace of magical energy at all!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, let's fight!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
...Whew.  
Bio-response has disappeared.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I can confirm that here, too. Whew, that scared me...  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuuuh...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fran?  
...You want us to investigate the homunculus?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, can you analyze it?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, it'll take a little time, but...  
I'll get started.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, and that powerful magical energy I detected?  
I saw something similar in the fortress up ahead.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'd like you to go after it immediately.  
That homunculus suggests something bad is going on.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Roger.  
We'll head there now.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uuhhh.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fran, calm down please.  
&ndash;There's nobody here, huh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't sense anybody here either.  
...This might be worse than we thought.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuuuh... Uuuhh!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fran!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's follow her!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's catch her!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Right!  
Fran, wait!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uuh!  
  
   
**???:**  
&ndash;There you...are... My defective...big sister.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
!?!?!?  
  
   
**???:**  
You have...a funny look...on your...face.  
Or...have you...never...seen...your face...in a mirror?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fran, you're going too fast...  
Huh!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The same face?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Another Fran?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fran(?):**  
So that's...your new...Master...huh?  
Your morals...are defective...as well...then.  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
&ndash;When our Master...abandons us...we die.  
That is...our rule...right?  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
But you...became...a Heroic Spirit.  
And swore...loyalty to a...new Master.  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
Defective...to the core...  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuuh!  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
Oh...I see.  
You can't talk...my poor...Big Sister!  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
I can talk...like this!  
And Father...loves...me!  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
I'm different...than you...in every...way!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Who are you? And what did you do to the people in this fortress?  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
Stupid...human.  
You don't really...expect me...to answer that!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, the answer is clear.  
&ndash;You killed everyone in this fortress.  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
Hehehe.  
Wrong.  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
I...did not...kill them.  
I...gave...them...new...life.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It can't be!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I've got it! That homunculus was made using human parts!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As you know, homunculi are created using magical circuits as a base&ndash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But she's using magical energy to power corpses instead.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They're less like homunculi, and more like Fran...  
Closer to artificial humans!  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
Ahahahaha!  
Let's start...with a warm-up.  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
Try your best... Big Sister.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...They're coming!  
Fran, get ready!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuh...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fran!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Calm down!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fran:**   
...  
...(Nod nod)  
  
   
**Fran:**   
GGNNNAAAAAOOOOOHH!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Fran(?):**  
&ndash;Hmph. I...expected...as much.  
Fine. I'll...fight you...myself.  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
You will be...a good...test case.  
I am...not yet...complete.  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
But...if I...can defeat...Big Sister.  
I know...I will...become&ndash;complete.  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
Here...I...go!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
SSHA&mdash;AHHH!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Fran(?):**  
Ugh!?  
No...you can't...be this...strong!  
  
   
**???:**  
&ndash;Come home.  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
...Father!?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
!!!  
  
   
**???:**  
We have sufficient samples.  
It's time to go.  
  
   
**???:**  
Don't worry.  
You will become perfect. I promise.  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
...I under...stand.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I won't let you get away!  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
&ndash;"Blasted Tree!"  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uuuh!  
  
   
**Fran(?):**  
Farewell...Big Sister.  
Next time...we meet...will probably...be...goodbye.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She got away!  
Doctor!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's no good. There's no traces of magical energy left.  
...And what's more.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I just realized this, but the traces of magical energy in the fortress were a trap...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yup, there's nothing left.  
It's impossible to track them. I'm sorry...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I did get her data, though.  
Next time she shows up, I can track her... I think.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuhhh!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll get her next time!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yeah.  
We have to get stronger, too...  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uuuhh. (Nod Nod)  
  
  
## The Events of a Lonely Night in November II  
  
**Fran:**   
...Uh.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fran, are you okay?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh, uh.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If you say so.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, are you sure you detected&ndash;the other Fran at this location?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. I've been keeping a monitor running in the background since last time.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I caught nothing for a long time,  
and then suddenly I saw something.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I think it's her little sister.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's not your little sister?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She's an enemy?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I guess that's true.  
We'll call her E. Fran, then.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The "E" is for Enemy.  
That works perfectly, right?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuh...uh.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She seems extremely reluctant, but agrees.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I-I see.  
Then start by heading to that town over there.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But be careful.  
I'm not seeing any life signs in that town.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Does that mean...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, it's been destroyed.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yeah... It's just like before.  
There's no one around.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Detecting magical energy.  
...Probably more homunculi.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's several of them. Be careful!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuuuuhh&mdash;Ghaaannoohh!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Don't worry, Master.  
We can beat them easily!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Battle complete.  
...As expected, these were made from corpses as well.  
  
   
**???:**  
...Correct.  
But they were of great use nonetheless.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh!?  
  
   
**???:**  
It's been a long time.  
  
   
**???:**  
I'm surprised you've become a Heroic Spirit.  
You, a nameless creature who simply stole my name.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It was him... I knew it!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;Victor Frankenstein!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuh...  
  
   
**Victor:**   
Indeed.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
You became a Servant,  
and I became a ghost.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
But all the changes taking place in the world...  
It seems they have created the perfect environment for me.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
I am but a ghost. A remnant of the past.  
I am nothing more, and yet&ndash;  
  
   
**Victor:**   
With a strong enough will, I can do it again.  
I can start over.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
That miracle! That once-in-a-lifetime chance God gave me! It is mine once more!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Perhaps due to the Singularities...  
Even relatively stable eras are starting to waver.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In other words, the “If Victor Frankenstein had lived...” hypothesis is being put to the test.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Even if he can't change the world,  
he can murder an entire town.  
  
   
**E. Fran:**   
Father.  
That's...enough...right?  
  
   
**Victor:**   
Yes, of course, “Eve.”  
  
   
**Fran:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Victor:**   
Kill her.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
If you do, you can take her place&ndash;  
and become a new legend.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
Eve. The first woman, the mate of Adam. You'll become what can be called a perfect version of her.  
  
   
**E. Fran:**   
Yes...yes...yes!  
I'll do it! I'll do it! I'll kill Big Sister! I will! I will!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
You can't even speak?  
What a failure you are&ndash;  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Shut...up.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
?!?!?!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Talking...is...tiring.  
But... I'll...say...this.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Father. Little Sister.  
You...ended...long ago.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
I...find...my...own...husband.  
I...pick...my...own...name.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
So.  
Come...with me!  
  
   
**Victor:**   
You little&ndash;!  
  
   
**E. Fran:**   
Shut up!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Fran!  
We'll fight with you!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...Yes.  
Together!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Fran:**   
Hah... Hah... Hah!  
  
   
**E. Fran:**   
Ugh... Why! How!  
This...can't be! You! Big Sister!  
  
   
**E. Fran:**   
You can't...be this...strong!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
GGNNAAAAOOOH!  
  
   
**E. Fran:**   
Eek!  
  
   
**E. Fran:**   
Gaah!?  
  
   
**Victor:**   
...Oh, brother.  
  
   
**E. Fran:**   
Fa-ther. Fat-her. Fath-er.  
No...no...no! Strong...strong...strong!  
  
   
**Victor:**   
Don't worry, “Eve.”  
I never expected anything of you to begin with.  
  
   
**E. Fran:**   
&ndash;Huh?  
  
   
**Victor:**   
After all, the defect is in the soul used as the base.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
It's probably because you're not created from magical circuits like the homunculi.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
A degraded soul is inferior to a human.  
It can't possibly defeat a Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
There's only one reason I created you.  
  
   
**E. Fran:**   
Fath-er?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
!?!?!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wha&ndash;!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What? What's going on!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Victor Frankenstein...killed E. Fran!  
  
   
**E. Fran:**   
W-Why?  
I...did...everything...for you...  
  
   
**Victor:**   
I know.  
But&ndash;in the end, you're defective.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
And so am I, as a human.  
So I'm taking your body.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
My soul. My knowledge. My mind.  
Your body. Your abilities.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
Only together can we attain “Eve.” The gender change will be a bit difficult&ndash;but it's nothing to worry about.  
  
   
**E. Fran:**   
No...I don't want that...why...no...no...no...  
I don't...want...to become...Father!  
  
   
**E. Fran:**   
I just...wanted...Father to...compliment...me!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...  
  
   
**Victor:**   
...Now, let's continue.  
This “Eve” will be a little different.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
Come forth, Shadows.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Shadow Servants!  
He can summon those things?  
  
   
**Victor:**   
Of course. This is my world. My era. My home.  
You're the outsiders.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
I've removed limiters from “Eve,” as well.  
It's time to test my unrivaled power!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...This may be only a tiny crack in history.  
But we can't just ignore it.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Agreed.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uuuuh!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fran, defeat him.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Fran, avenge your sister.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fran:**   
Under-stood.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
&ndash;GNAAAAAAAOOOH!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Victor:**   
No... This can't be. There must be some mistake.  
I was given life by a miracle.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
If so, my second coming was to create my own miracle, no? Right? Right, that's how it should be...  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...No. You...just...by chance...were there.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
Don't be stupid!  
...How could you lie like that!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
You...only...needed...to...live.  
With...someone...you...love.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Then...we...might...never...meet...again.  
  
   
**Victor:**   
No. That's a lie. You're a liar. I was chosen.
