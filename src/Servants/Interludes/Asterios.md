# Asterios  
  
## This Hand, For You  
  
**Asterios:**   
Um. Master.  
Hello.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hello...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Good morning...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Asterios:**   
I am glad.  
Mash, Master, awake.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh Master, are you all right?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What happened?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not sure, but it seems we are lost inside this labyrinth.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Communication with the Doctor has been cut off as well.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fortunately, Asterios and Fou are with us.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Fou...this...cookie...want...to...eat?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Munch, munch.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Good boy.  
Good boy.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It appears unless we get out of this labyrinth,  
we won't be able to contact anyone.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
I will...go...ahead.  
Everyone...get out...of here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, let's go!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It certainly is dark...  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Master...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Asterios:**   
Sorry.  
It was...nothing.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
...Wait.  
I smell...something...strange.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I can faintly smell...  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
The smell...of blood.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
...Master, stand back.  
I...Asterios...will defeat them!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Asterios:**   
Whew.  
Is everyone...all right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Both Fou and Master are just fine.  
How are you, Asterios?  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
No problem.  
Continue.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It sure is far.  
It seems like this place goes on forever...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Master, are you ok?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm still fine.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll be all right.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Asterios:**   
Are you sure?  
Don't...push yourself.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He's right. Please don't force yourself.  
For now, let's just walk a bit longer.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
...Hmm.  
I knew it...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What's the matter?  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Here...turn left.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Do you know the way?  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Yes. Used to it. This...labyrinth...  
I...grew up...here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In the Labyrinth?  
I-I thought this place looked familiar...  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
So...I know...the exit.  
But...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But what?  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
...We cannot avoid...being attacked.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There are more enemies.  
Master, orders please.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Lead us...Master.  
I will...fight!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Asterios:**   
Master...tired?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A little...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yes.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Asterios:**   
Master...if all right...  
I know...it's not.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
But...hold my hand?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Would it be ok with you?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Asterios:**   
You don't mind...I don't mind.  
Yes. This...is good.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is everything all right, Asterios?  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Why?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, it's just that, instead of going up we are going deeper and deeper.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Yes.  
That is...correct.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see...  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
...Excuse me...Master.  
Master...afraid...of me?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why would I be?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's there to be afraid of?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Asterios:**   
...If not afraid...then it's fine.  
I am...glad.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
That...voice...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Asterios?  
  
   
**Child:**   
Stop, I am scared...  
Please stop!  
  
   
**Child:**   
Help...me...  
  
   
**???:**  
...Heeheeheeheehee!  
Tasty, tasty, tasty.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Ugh!  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Are...you...  
Are you... Me?  
  
   
**Asterios(?):**  
Yes, I am.  
Do I look like anything, else?  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
...Stop that.  
  
   
**Asterios(?):**  
But this is what you did.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
...I did...this.  
That's why...I am...ending this.  
  
   
**Asterios(?):**  
Hee, hee, hee.  
What are you talking about.  
  
   
**Asterios(?):**  
You know, this is what you wished!  
You wanted to eat, so you ate!  
  
   
**Asterios(?):**  
I am a Minotaur!  
I am nothing else than that!  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
&ndash;I am...Asterios!  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
As long as...there are people...calling my name.  
I will...continue to...reject you!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Asterios(?):**  
Y. O. U...  
You think you can reject "yourself?"  
  
   
**Asterios(?):**  
You know, it's worse than death.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
I must... I must...reject myself. I reject everything about me... I throw away everything about me.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
&ndash;That is...my...punishment.  
&ndash;That is...my...atonement.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Master... Let's go...  
The exit...is not far.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
May I hold your hand?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Asterios:**   
...Yes. Let us go.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
&ndash;Someday...I want to hold someone's hand.  
&ndash;That's...what I thought.
