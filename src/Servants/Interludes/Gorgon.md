# Gorgon  
  
## You Are a Monster

**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Something's touching my cheek...)  
  
  
---  
   
**Narration:**   
I felt something that was both cold and warm...  
Something between hard and soft...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It felt...rough...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Something is grasping my finger...)  
  
  
---  
   
**Narration:**   
It felt like a bottomless chasm...just waiting to swallow me whole...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It felt damp...  
  
   
**???:**  
How boring...  
  
   
**???:**  
Ah, now it's crying out saying it can wait no longer. My hair...my evil...is shamelessly driveling...  
  
   
**???:**  
If you do not wake up soon,  
I may really eat you...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(WHA...!?!?!?)  
  
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Where am I...?  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
...Hmph. So you have awoken.  
That was a close call for you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There are scale marks on my cheek!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There's a snake chewing on my finger!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
If you're disappointed that I spared your life rather than relieved...  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
...then tell me that you lament having missed the opportunity to merge with me and melt into sweet oblivion.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
It's not too late to speak up.  
Don't you fret. I am always hungry.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, no, no, no...no. Don't worry about me.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oh, uh, thanks, but I'm...fine...  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Mmm. What...is this place?  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
I just found myself here with you sleeping beside me. You're my Master. Do you know what is happening?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This has happened to me a few times...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Probably a dream, or your unconscious or something...  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
...? What do you mean? Explain more in detail.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Hehe...hahahaha!  
A dream. A dream? Of mine!? Oh you ARE funny...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's...funny?  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Of course it is. Look around you.  
See this cold, empty world.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
It's so dark... Not a mote of light to be seen,  
nor a sign of life anywhere.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Your lungs are filled with dark and ominous air.  
What dread sights you can see are most sinister.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
The cold floor is damp, like a demon's entrails,  
and eagerly awaits you to collapse and die...  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Its hideous walls stifle you,  
waiting to close around you like a coffin.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
There is nothing at all good here. A true nightmare for any human. A being of pure despair and evil...that is what I am.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Ah... This place is a true reflection of my nature...utterly monstrous!  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
I certainly could not argue if you said this was a reflection of who I am within. All I can do is laugh at this! Hahahaha!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're talking nonsense again...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe there's a field of flowers over there...  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
... I've always wondered.  
What do you think of me, truly?  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Now more than ever, you fail to understand my nature, which makes this a good opportunity to teach you.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
I am...evil. That is all.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
The third sister of a certain family, destined to become a monster. That is all I am.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
As my power goes beyond any mere common evil,  
some may even call me the mother of Demonic Beasts.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Yet you do not fear me... Why?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We don't have any trouble communicating...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You seem to understand what I say...  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
...If communication is all you require, your bar is quite...low.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
And even that is only possible because, at this moment, I exist in a state between my forms as a goddess and monster.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
I honestly do not understand why I was summoned in this state...  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Let me make myself clear. I am not a goddess.  
I am a monster. I am a divinity who turned evil.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
That's why you&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's that voice!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Something's coming!  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Hah... I am the mother of Demonic Beasts. I devour even other evils. It would not surprise me to know there are a few lurking within me.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
At least it may be amusing to watch whatever hungry beasts lurk here devour you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'd appreciate it if you'd help me out...  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Shut up. I don't care what you want.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
But... I have no intention of feeding the other evils that work within me in this dream of mine.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Letting them feast on your flesh would be a waste.  
Besides, I happen to feel like exercising just now.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Consider yourself lucky.  
You can cower before me once we finish here.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Now, look upon my form and learn...  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Learn that the being you thought you could merely talk with is a monster who will turn your stomach!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Gorgon:**   
Hahaha...what do you think!?  
Did you see my terrible serpent form!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks! You saved me!  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
That's not what I'm talking about!  
That's not what you should be saying!  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
You should be terrified! You should be soiling yourself! You should be begging me not to eat you!  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
This is the time to beg for your life!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So, I'm thinking leaving would be a good idea...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't think we should stay long...  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Ungh...  
This human...is unbelievable...!  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Argh! Fine! So!?  
Do you have any idea how to escape!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't, but let's just keep going.  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Hmph. Are you saying we should simply head in that direction?  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
The single, obvious way out in a place steeped in nothing but evil on all sides?  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
I suspect that will only lead us to a hell far worse than the one we find ourselves in now.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
But you willingly walk headlong into peril...and you are even willing to peek into the underbelly of the hideous monster I am?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm sure there are parts of yourself you don't want anyone seeing...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We've got to go that way to get out, sorry.  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Silence. It seems you value neither your life nor your sanity.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Perhaps you will realize what they were worth once you've lost them. Hehe.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Very well. I'm intrigued.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
I shall watch your final moments and mock them to the very end. You may meet your end without fear. Hahaha.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
...Hold it right there. Are you a fool?  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Did you not think that carelessly venturing out might mean your death? If you simply perished, I would be robbed of my chance to watch a demon devour you.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Just stand behind me and follow me, scum.  
Unbelievable...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(She might get angry again if I thank her...)  
  
  
---  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Gorgon:**   
I can feel the evil presence growing stronger.  
It certainly doesn't bother me, but you&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...?  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Tsk. You're fine? Disappointing. Do you have no consideration for how your whimpering and looks of terror would keep me entertained on this dull journey?  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Don't you know?  
Human suffering is my greatest pleasure.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Seeing, hearing, and tasting human suffering are my favorite things to do...  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
That terror, oh it makes me drool in anticipation. There is no better seasoning for my meal.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that because...you're an Avenger?  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
...What a silly thing to say.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
That class was forced upon me when I was summoned as a Servant.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
But...you're probably right.  
Your absurd question jogged my memory.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Memory of what?  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Rage!  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Yes...I may truly be an Avenger. The desire for revenge does indeed burn within my Spirit Origin.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
But...revenge against what?  
Whatever is it that I hate so much?  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
The unknown is what infuriates me, and it has led me to kill and devour all living things I encounter.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
That, at least, I find fulfilling, all the more so if the victim is someone I loathe.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Heh...a monster who doesn't even know who deserves her vengeance...  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Of all the Heroic Spirits you employ,  
I must be the most bizarre and horrible!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's not true...  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Tsk. I've said too much. Forget it.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Either way, the stench of evil is getting stronger here. Something is bound to happ&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I-it got dark all of a sudden!  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Quiet.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Hmph. I can hardly see... Even my own eyes cannot see through...the darkness within me...  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
... Fine. For now...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
And something touched me!!!  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
I said keep quiet. That's just my hair.  
Hold on to it and don't let go.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
If you annoy it, it may bite off a finger or two.  
If you want to live, deal with it. Let's go.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(I hope she's only kidding...)  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
... There's something up ahead...  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
...! Is...that...  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
My older sisters...  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
And that's...  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Me!!!  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Wait. Stop. What are you doing?  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
No...what are you...trying to show me!?  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
...!  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
...  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Ah, I see.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
So this is a dream to show me what might have been!!!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What was that...?  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
...Let me ask you.  
What did you just see?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh...I don't know, it was all fuzzy...  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
I see. That's a relief.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Even if you did see something or THINK you saw something, don't ask. I'll kill you if you do.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can still see the other Gorgon.  
  
  
---  
   
**???:**  
...  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Hmph. I'll let that one slide.  
That's only the “me” I see in my dreams.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
And that...that is... Hahaha!  
All the more reason to kill it!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're going to kill it!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Of course. That being is the center of the evil that has flooded this realm. My body...my every instinct...cries out for that thing's blood!  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
(Instinct...that's right...instinct.)  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
(If that is true...)  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
(Is that what defines my existence? Is that how I will end up? Is it telling me to seek revenge...)  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
(...against the humans and world that led me here...?)  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
(Hehe...hahaha!!!)  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
(Who cares? Even if that were true,  
my purpose does not change. I am not wrong.)  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
(I devour what I wish. I kill what I wish.  
That is the essence of my very being!)  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Ah, of course. Of course. In the end...this is all monsters are able to do!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Gorgon:**   
The darkness is starting to clear...  
Hehehe... Oh, that was satisfying!  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
And yet...that was no more than a shadow of my past and future. I know just how pointless it is.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
?  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Hah! That vacant look...  
I can see you do not understand. But I do.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
What would you call something that is both satisfying and completely pointless?  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
...Amusement.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
I had an amusing dream. If how I feel now is any indication...I would say it was a sweet dream.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Let me reiterate: I am a monster.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Killing that monster&ndash;that other me&ndash;and bathing in its blood was exhilarating. I found that dream...amusing.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Knowing that...do you still want something like me in your Chaldea?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Why? I've told you time and time again, and you still don't get it!? I am no Heroic Spirit! I AM A MONSTER!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Whatever you are, you are here now.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You answered my call...  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
...You are mistaken.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Even I do not know why I was summoned.  
It must have been some kind of accident.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Even if it's an accident or a mistake, I'm happy.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thank you for coming to Chaldea.  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
I said...you...!  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
(Sigh) So annoying.  
Even my hunger has dissipated.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
...Hmph. It's almost time to wake up.  
I failed to devour the moron before me.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
...  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Perhaps it is the same for humans, but I will likely forget this most amusing dream of mine.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
And if you don't want me to remember that I failed to devour you...  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Do not ever mention what happened in this dream should you recall it. For your own safety.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Hmph.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh.  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
What's wrong, Senpai?  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
...! (Silent pressure)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
  
---  
   
**Gorgon:**   
... (Look that says, “Good. Keep quiet.”)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...?  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Very suspicious, don't you think, “me?”  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Yes. They were exchanging knowing glances with each other, “me.”  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Hehe...our foolish younger sister, who's three times the size of the one we're used to seeing...the BBB (Big Big Big) Mountain...  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
What in the world do you think transpired between her and Master last night? I am so curious.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Yes. We must pry it out of her...down to the last juicy detail.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Privacy? What's that?  
We had no such thing on our island.  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Older sisters...!?  
  
   
**Stheno & Euryale:**   
Fess up. Right now.  
Come on...hurry up...spill it...!  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
M-Master! Remember that we had planned a training session in the simulator!?  
  
   
**Gorgon:**   
Let's get going! It's important! If I don't get exercise, I'll get rusty! Now, please excuse us!  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
She's fleeing with Master! Does that mean something really...is there some truth behind what we think happened between them!?  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Hold it right there! Do you think you can get away with keeping secrets from your older sisters!? You big, giant fool of a sister! Wait up!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wh-what just happened?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou!
