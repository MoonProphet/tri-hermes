# Astolfo  
  
## While Waiting for Roland  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Yahoo! Master!  
We're gonna go on an adventure!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...?  
Astolfo? Where are you going?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
To France!  
I thought I'd pay Roland a visit.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um.  
I don't think Roland is around in 1431...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
It's okay! All we gotta do is wander around France,  
and I'm sure he'll get summoned one of these days!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Now let's go, go, go!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
H-hey, don't be so pushy!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Here...we...goooooo!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai...Senpaaai!!!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Sorry! I'm lost!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Called it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I kinda figured.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Master. If you knew this would happen,  
you should have said something earlier.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I guess there's nothing to be done now. Fortunately, you have camping supplies, so I suggest you spend the night in the forest.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Yay!!! Camping! Camping!  
Hey, do you have curry?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Curry! Curry!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, if you're a Servant,  
you don't need to eat...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Ehhh?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's fine. Here you go.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's eat together.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Yay! Thank you Master!  
Then make mine an extra large curry!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
More! Mooore!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Here you go.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Thanks!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I think you're spoiling Astolfo too much, Senpai.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You think so?  
   
**Mash:**   
I do.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Then I'll spoil you when we get back, Mash!  
   
**Mash:**   
Eh? Me!?  
Um...well...no...you mustn't...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, but if you insist,  
I shall gratefully...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Master, Master! More!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Again!?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Whew! I ate a lot!  
I'm stuffed!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master. You are out of emergency rations.  
You'll need to purchase food in town tomorrow...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Okay, then I'm going to sleep to prepare for tomorrow. Good night!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
...Zzzzzz.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That was fast, Master.  
Astolfo just fell asleep in the middle of a sentence.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just like a child.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Some kids act like that.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Is that true?  
I've never met any children like that in Chaldea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, but I remembered something.  
It was when I first met you, Senpai...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Ahhh! What a refreshing morning!  
...Huh? What's wrong?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
N-nothing. I just didn't get enough sleep.  
It's okay. It shouldn't affect us in combat.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Ahaha. Master, you look sleepy too.  
Well, let's head off!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Where could Roland be?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In conditions like this, I sincerely doubt a Servant could be summoned easily...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
I guess so...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is Roland your lover?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is Roland your boyfriend?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Roland?  
Hahahaha! That's a riot!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
That guy...he's no good, Master.  
He's good-looking, but he's bad inside.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
...No. That's not the word. He's not bad on the inside. Hmmm... To put it in today's terms, he's...disappointing?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
No matter how good someone looks, you'd still kinda judge 'em if they ran around town naked, right?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Roland does that! Happily, even! It's practically a hobby! He'll just run around buck naked!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
That's just the kinda guy he is,  
so prolly not really “lover” material, y'know?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...It's true. According to legend,  
Roland stripped his clothes off, mad with grief.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But I didn't think he really ran around...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Ayup. That's cause after that, he'd get naked every chance he had. Said he got hooked on it. Hooked!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Stripping?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hooked?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
(Did he have a mental breakdown...?)  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Anyway, let's go look for some enemies.  
My Astolfo-sense is telling me that fort looks suspicious!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh...  
Astolfo is always so pushy...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But if Roland ever joined us, I feel he would be a great asset. Let's do our best to find him.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Yep! He'd for sure be dependable, you've got the Astolfo guarantee on that! Other stuff...not so much.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It seems like Fou is also concerned...or at least that's what I'm getting from that response.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
By the way, I'm curious about something.  
Hey, Mash.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes? What is it?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Are you okay seeing naked men?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I-I-I...I suppose.  
I've never seen one, but I should be okay...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-it is through the filter of a screen, too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I-I-I think it should be okay. Yes. It'll be fine.  
I have a little knowledge about those things.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'll be fine. I'll be ready. As long as you let me mentally prepare, it'll be totally fine.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Oh, good!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. Please rest assured...somewhat.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
...Master. I'm betting Mash will scream.  
What about you?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm all in for screaming.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There's nothing to bet on.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I'll be fine! Totally!  
I'll definitely probably be okay!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
We've arrived!  
Hey, you guys there.  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
...Hm? What?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
You're looking kinda tired.  
Everything okay?  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
...It's complicated. This old man is considering quitting the soldiering life and go home...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Really? Then, good work! Hey by the way,  
did you see a naked handsome guy running around?  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
...A naked...handsome guy?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Yep!  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
A guy with a bright smile, but he looks a bit dumb,  
but at the same is stupid strong...that handsome guy?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Yep, that's the one.  
We're looking for him!  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
I see...you're looking for him?  
I see, I see. Hey, everyone!  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Some friends of that naked jackass are here!  
Get 'em!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Eh...eh!?  
Wh-what, why!?  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
No questions asked!  
Cock-a-doodle-doo! Arrrf! Wooof!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What exactly happened to anger those men so much!?  
What did this Roland do!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-anyway, Astolfo!  
We need to calm them down!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
I know, I know! I'll give 'em what for and that'll calm 'em right down! Astolfo PUNCH!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well...um, I can't argue with that... Anyway,  
please strike with the flat of the blade, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Soldier:**   
Why you...I curse you for the nakedness...ungh.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Whew.  
I worked up a good sweat.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mine was cold sweat...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Um, the first guys...yeah, this guy!  
Hey! Are you okay?  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Y-yeah... (Gasp) Wh-who the hell are you guys?  
And why're you so strong?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
So tell me. Roland...I mean the naked guy...do you know where he is?  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
He ran wild in that fort and then disappeared...  
All we wanted to do was to put clothes on him...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
That is...I can only say I'm sorry.  
I am pretty sure he didn't not mean to do any harm.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You need to find him, Astolfo.  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Oh, and when he jumped up, he pressed his crotch on my face... I'm scarred...forever...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Hey! You gotta say stuff like that earlier!  
I put my face right next to yours!!!  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Terrible...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Don't cry!  
Now I'm getting sad, too!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wanna go home?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's retreat.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
N-no. If Roland is out there, running amok,  
then that's a problem we need to fix.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's at least resolve this problem.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Y-yeah. I'll do my best!  
So please don't abandon me, Master!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Hmmm...I haven't heard any screams...yet.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm worried about how all these citizens have this thousand yard stare...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They all look like they saw something no one should ever see.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
I'm sure it's just a Demon King or something. Probably. Let's ask around.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I have a bad feeling about this...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Hey, soldier. Mind answering a question?  
See a naked guy running around the streets here?  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
...Naked. Guy.  
This. Road. Straight. Go.  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
I. Lead. Way. Follow. Me.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Really? Yay, a clue!  
Let's go, Master!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Aren't you the least bit suspicious about what that man said!? W-wait just a moment!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Hm. Hey soldier.  
Where's the naked guy?  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
You. Friends. That. Guy.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
N-no, that's not...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Um, technically I am.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry! I couldn't help it! It just slipped out!  
Fou, I'm sorry!  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Fufufu. This. Grudge. Must. Not. Ignore.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Uwaa! They're attacking!  
What the heck? We were tricked!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Not tricked, really. I knew they would attack.  
Of course they would!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Whew. We beat them.  
They were so pale, I thought they were zombies!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They seemed that way because of those dead fish eyes of theirs...  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Ungh...  
So what the heck was he...?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
What did he do to you guys?  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
I scolded him because he was naked.  
Then he got violent...  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
He even climbed onto the two hundred year old statue of our town's saint...and he mounted his head...  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
And he shouted  
“I'm the king of the world!!!”  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
The rest...was all a mess.  
Then he ran off, laughing.  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
The kids cried...the women blushed but stared...I'm starting to get really tired of living a proper life.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please get a hold of yourself.  
It's okay. Please live a proper life!  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
You think so? I feel like I'm in an illusion and hallucination at the same time...  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
See? There's a little girl up ahead...  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Oh, so it was an illusion.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Aw, c'mon. A little hallucination now and then is no big deal! People get to keep on having fun after they lose their sense of reason, too!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We absolutely need to stop this rampage!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Astolfo, we need to stop the perv&ndash;I mean, Roland!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Got it! ...Wait a minute.  
I thought the plan was to get him to join us?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Oh well!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's not good.  
  
  
---  
   
**Astolfo:**   
He came through the city.  
Where could he have gone?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Oh, footprints!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'll analyze them.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The print isn't from a shoe.  
It's from a bare foot.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...There's only one person crazy enough to walk a wasteland barefoot...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Roland! Okay!  
Let's get to trackin'!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
I feel like we're playing a game of boy scouts! If Geronimo was here, he'd give us some big fancy lecture about tracking and the land or...something...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
'Course, then I'd forget it about a minute later!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
The footprints continue this way... This way...  
Turn this way... He climbed a tree...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Stole a bird egg...  
Ate it...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Ouch!  
I-I won't steal, okay!?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Afterward, he wasn't satisfied with just one egg...  
He wandered around...fought a wyvern..  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Then ate it...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He ate it!?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Raw, too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Raw!?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
And then afterward, he got food poisoning from eating the raw wyvern, and he threw up right here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master!  
This is not encouraging!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just a little bit further...  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-yes. As your navigator,  
I'll stick with you till the very end!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Keep at it.  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh...Master's getting discouraged too.  
A little more...let's stick to it a little bit more...!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Astolfo:**   
So...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Theeen he stepped all over his own vomit,  
then he staggered along...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
And then he went to sleep sulking for just a bit.  
Hey, do you think it feels nice, sleeping naked on the ground like that?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is like a strange geoglyph, isn't it?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
But then...a wild horse came rushing toward him from the side...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
And it kicked Roland's back.  
Oh, his mouth's bleeding a little.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I have no more energy to comment on this.  
Master, I leave the rest to you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't want to do that!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I thought you were supposed to play the straight man!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
But...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
And then Roland stood up.  
He called for the horse's owner!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
And then he got into an argument.  
Roland was so angry...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
He choked the owner and tossed him under this tree...  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
H-how irrational...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yet another victim.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
And then Roland mounted the horse...  
Everything was going fine for a while...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
But then he realized that riding a horse naked and bareback causes various areas to start hurting...and so he dismounted.  
  
   
**H：Horse:**   
Neeeighhh.  
Brrrgh.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So it really does hurt?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Why not try it yourself?  
Naked.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Absolutely not.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
A shame. By the way, mister horse,  
do you know where the naked guy who rode you went?  
  
   
**H：Horse:**   
Neeeigh!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
He said, “Follow me.”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So we're finally going to meet him.  
Hnnn...my body's trembling...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
...There! There he is!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
I finally found you, Roland!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, I'm starting to get embarrassed!  
I'm not fine!  
  
   
**???:**  
O-ooohhh...you are...are you by chance Astolfo?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, oh! Clothes! He's wearing clothes!  
I'm so relieved!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Yeah...yeah it's me, Roland! I'm glad! I'm glad I could pick you out because you're wearing clothes!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
If you were naked, I probably wouldn't have recognized your face!  
  
   
**Roland:**   
Th-that cheerfully dumb child...  
You really are Astolfo!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Hey, it's been a while.  
How've you been?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Oh, let me introduce you!  
This is my Master.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hello...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I heard so much about you from Astolfo.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Astolfo:**   
And this is Master's other Servant...she's a navigator for us now. Her name's Mash!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm Mash Kyrielight.  
I serve as a navigator for Master in Chaldea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
P-pleased to meet you.  
  
   
**Roland:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Roland:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, Master.  
He's looking at me. He's...really staring!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
B-be patient.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It'll be okay.

**Roland:**   
You said your name is Mash Kyrielight.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-yes.  
  
   
**Roland:**   
What a beautiful name...  
Fitting for someone as beautiful as you...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Eh, um...thank you very much.  
  
   
**Roland:**   
The moon out tonight is...beautiful...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Eh?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wh-what was that?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Could it be...?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I-I-I have no idea!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not sure if those were romantic words or...I really don't have any experience with that!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Roland's waiting for a response.  
He's even prostrating himself!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Beautiful...what a beautiful way he bows...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash. The gentleman is waiting. Answer him.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
M-my apologies...  
I'm very sorry, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Men who like to be naked...are not really my...  
  
   
**Roland:**   
...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Oh, he stood up. Hey, don't get discouraged just because you got rejected by a girl!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Although...people fall for me all the time so I've never been rejected!  
  
   
**Roland:**   
WHAAAAAA...!??  
  
   
**Roland:**   
If that's...how it is...then let's all die together!!!  
Together!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Eh, together!?  
  
   
**Roland:**   
Yes! This will be like Romeo and Juliet!  
Oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wrong role!  
  
   
**Roland:**   
Now, if you can hand me my Juliet, Master Romeo!  
  
   
**Roland:**   
Fufu...fufufu...fuhahahahaha!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master! He is not Roland!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
To be clear, he's just lingering emotions Roland left behind...a remnant...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway, he's a fake!  
That's such a relief!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Hmmm, so we're gonna have to fight, huh?  
Well, if he's a fake, it can't be helped! (Nobbu!)  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Okay, Master!  
I'm going to win...for Mash's sake!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Got it. Don't leave anything behind.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's do it. It's going to regret ever being born.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Okay.  
I'm gonna pull out all the stops!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Come on, Hippogriff!  
Master's cheering you on! Let's give it our all!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm counting on you, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Roland-ish Thing:**   
Regret...!  
Nothing but regret!!!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Roland...  
  
   
**Roland-ish Thing:**   
Unnnnggh...  
At least...before I die...I wanted to...  
  
   
**Roland-ish Thing:**   
...Expose everything...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Even his evil ghost is saying that!? THAT'S your last wish!? Ahahaha! And that's why Roland's hilarious!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
I bet even our king would laugh himself silly if he saw you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
By king, you mean...?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Charlemagne, of course! Now that I think about it...  
I wonder why he hasn't been summoned yet either...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Me, Roland, the king...  
One day I'd like to fight alongside them!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Okay! Anyway, we saw Roland! Kinda! And once he gets summoned properly, we can see him again!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
But my Astolfo sense tells me that if we meet,  
it'll be in a REALLY dumb situation!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Sorry for all the hassle, Master.  
Now, let's go home!
