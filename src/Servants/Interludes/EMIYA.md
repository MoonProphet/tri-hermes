# EMIYA  
  
## To be a Master  
  
**Emiya:**   
What a disaster...  
What kind of Holy Grail War happened here?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
No sign of the Mage's Association or Holy Church, which means a battle royale among the Masters.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
They probably misused their Servants, and let them do whatever they want.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Fujimaru, make sure you control your Servants, so you don't end up with a mess like this.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Control my Servants?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is it wrong to let them do what they want?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Emiya:**   
Use your Command Spells to keep them in check.  
If they're up to something, teach them a lesson, or make them fight.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Many Masters use their Command Spells to force their Servants to commit suicide as a safety measure.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
When a Master realizes a Heroic Spirit is "too much to handle," using the Spells that way can save many lives.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see... It's true that there are many Servants who just want to cause destruction.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Most Berserkers are like that.  
I didn't realize you could use a Spell that way.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As expected of the great Emiya, a true veteran who's been through many Holy Grail Wars.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Y-Yeah. Well, when it comes to Holy Grail Wars,  
I know more than your average Servant.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Ahem. All right Fujimaru, this is a good chance. I'm going to give you a proper lecture.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Of course, Dr. Roman has already taught you what you need to know about combat.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
So this time, I'll teach you about something you won't see in the stats, a Heroic Spirit's...attributes.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Heroic Spirits can be divided into four main categories.  
"Human", "Earth", "Heaven," and "Star."  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Those under the "Human" category are people born after AD, and praised as heroes after their death because of their great deeds in life.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Some of them were actual super humans when alive, but most of them were only glorified after death.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Andersen, Shakespeare, Robin Hood, and Lady Nightingale would all be examples.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Next, the "Earth" category.  
These are heroes spoken of in local folklore&mdash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(...This feels like another long talk.  
Fujimaru, is he always like this?)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sometimes he gets this way.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. He's normally quiet and serious, but from time to time he gets very nosy.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He sort of talks too much.  
That's our Emiya.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
His attribute is "talky mom."  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see... Talky mom attribute, eh?  
We'll just have to let him talk till he's done then.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Emiya:**   
The fourth category "Star," is where things get important.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The "Star" is a special category. It represents mankind's hope and symbolizes overcoming hardship.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
This category might seem powerful as it has no weakness against the other three, but its true nature lies elsewhere.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
There's another category equal to the "Star."  
That's the fifth&mdash;  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...We were interrupted just as it was getting good.  
Fujimaru, prepare for combat.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
They must have smelled us.  
They'll make contact in 20 seconds!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right! Preparing for combat immediately!  
Initiate anti-wild beast combat!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Emiya:**   
For our next topic, I'll explain what makes each class unique. We'll start with the Archer class,  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Archers, as the name implies, use a bow as their primary weapon.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
While inferior to Saber and Lancer in close range combat, they excel at providing long range support.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
They also have a skill called "Independent Action."  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Even without a link to their Master, they can function for a while on their own.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But they won't be able to maintain the physical body.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Lack of energy source aside, wouldn't they be forced back to the Throne without an anchor to this world?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Normally, yeah. But with Independent Action,  
they can ease up the "force exerted by the World."  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
After all, there are many stories of snipers camping out 3 days and 3 nights just to hit their targets.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Think of it as a skill that allows them to function for a few days apart from their Master.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
What's important is that the skill differs from Assassin's Presence Concealment. It does not conceal your movement.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Stealth operations thus require the appropriate skill, or backups from their Master.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Archer, I hate to interrupt Fujimaru's lecture, but as I'm sure you're aware...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
An enemy attack, right? They always pick the worst timing. It's so hard to have class outdoors.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(...I probably shouldn't mention that Archer's loud voice is telling the enemy exactly where we are, right?)  
  
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Emiya:**   
Lastly, a word about what it means to be a Master.  
I'll tell you how to get along with your Servants.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You're still keeping this up!  
Man, you don't know when to quit, do you?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
What are you talking about?  
I'm here lecturing because the people at Chaldea won't.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I heard how you became a Master, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
You're no Mage, and you have no experience.  
You became a Master by accident, yes?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Even if no one else can do your job, that's still absurd.  
I should at least teach you how to act like a Master.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm sorry, Senpai. Emiya's right,  
none of the adults left at Chaldea are any good...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I do feel bad, you know!  
I am devoting myself fully to medical work as well!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Enough. We're talking about Servants.  
They are Heroic Spirits from many different eras.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Basically, a Servant will be more powerful than their Master. You understand that?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes.  
No one needs a familiar weaker than they are.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Correct. But it's wrong for a Master to unduly respect or fear their Servant.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
They have achieved great things, but within the confines of the contract, that means nothing.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The Master and Servant relationship is defined by the contract, but mentally it's best for them to be equals.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Listen. Even a godlike Servant got their start the same way as you.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Anyone who lives in the modern era, uses the wisdom their ancestors left behind&mdash;  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Servants are no different.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Even Heroic Spirits achieved deeds with the help of others when they were alive, and that's why they choose to contract with you.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
In other words, being summoned and relied on isn't necessarily a bad thing for a Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
For example, how would you feel if something you left behind could aid the people of the next era?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...That would be kind of nice.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It would feel like the proof that I lived.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Emiya:**   
That's right.  
Servants feel the same way.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The deeds you did, the things you left behind nurtures the next generation&mdash;All Servants take pride in that.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Doesn't matter if the Servant is good or evil.  
Servants and Masters are mentally equal.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
A Servant aiding a Master, is simply a matter of duty.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
That is what it means to live on this planet.  
What you do will surely help someone in the future.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Someone in the future...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Ahem, Mr. Emiya?  
I hate to interrupt the speech, but...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
(Sigh) Very well.  
I've said what I must.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
So, what is it this time? Golems? Skeletons?  
At this point a wyvern wouldn't surprise me.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, um&mdash;  
Honestly, we shouldn't be seeing any of these here...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-It's an army of female soldiers! I have no idea why!  
Gorilla-like women...In other words, GoriWoms!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They're heading straight for Emiya!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
My bad luck with women is following me here? Aah!  
It feels like someone's doing this deliberately!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
And future generations would know this as the great Amazonian Migration. The end.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Doctor, was this your doing?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? Nope! Wasn't me!  
Definitely not! No way!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway, I think that's the last attack.  
Emiya, feel free to continue.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
(Sigh) Never mind.  
I think I'll call it a day.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It was rude of me to assume you needed those lectures.  
Fujimaru already has many wonderful Servants.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
With Mash Kyrielight at your side, you won't be easily defeated.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
You have a long journey ahead of you.  
You'll learn through experience, not words.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll do the best I can.  
   
**Emiya:**   
Good. Go at your own pace, and don't rush.  
You'll do yourself no good pushing too hard.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash is the only one with talent.  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru, sometimes you can be just brutal, you know that?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, Emiya.  
No, Servant Archer.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I was wondering.  
Why are you being so nice to us?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Other Servants are interested in Senpai's skills.  
You're the only one who cares what Senpai thinks.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It's simple.  
Now that you're my Master, I need you to succeed.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It's business. A form of advertising.  
I want people to know that my Masters succeed.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
If word gets around, the next time I'm summoned I can ask for a higher price, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, in other words, it's for your own benefit?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So this is for us, and for yourself too?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Yes, that's right.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
For one thing, it would damage my reputation to leave an inexperienced young [♂ boy /♀️ girl}.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
A true Servant helps their Master grow, and thus enhances their own reputation.  
  
  
## Unlimited Blade Works  
  
**Mash:**   
We've arrived at the Massive Cavern in Fuyuki.  
Emiya, what's here, exactly?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I sensed this presence when I came to "this" Fuyuki before. I've been waiting for the right timing.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Right timing?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Presence?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Emiya:**   
A tough foe I've a particular attachment to&mdash;  
Or an impassable wall, you could say.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Fujimaru, you're aware that I can't use my Noble Phantasm yet, of course.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I've sealed it away, until you've grown strong enough as a Master.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So that's why. I thought that was weird. Your Noble Phantasm manifests the landscape in your mind.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No catalyst is necessary.  
You simply need to be there.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yet you couldn't use it. That's because you were waiting for Fujimaru's growth, right?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I'm well-aware that it's nosy of me, but there is an order to all things, you see.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I didn't want you to become the kind of Master who relies too much on Noble Phantasms.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fujimaru has grown as a Master.  
Enough for you to use your Noble Phantasm, right?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I can finally use Archer's Noble Phantasm!?  
   
**Emiya:**   
Yes. You've done well so far.  
But first, there's one more thing you have to do.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thanks, but that's overprotective!  
   
**Emiya:**   
I'll just have to ask you to resign yourself to it.  
I get too attached to those I like.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Emiya:**   
It might look different, but this is still the Greater Grail.  
The Holy Grail War that happens here...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Its strongest Servant awaits within.  
You will defeat it for me.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
If you can do that, I'll have nothing left to teach you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Within...Does he mean...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...What was it again?  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Come on, get a hold of yourself!  
Berserker! It's Berserker!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That giant lump of pitch darkness.  
Just like a walking hurricane.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Berserker.  
   
**Mash:**   
...That's right.  
The Servant we stood no chance against before.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Emiya:**   
I see you know him, that saves me the time.  
Let's be prepared when we fight&mdash;  
  
   
**Monster:**   
GuRuuuuuuuuuuuu&mdash;!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I guess we have to do some warm-ups first.  
Let's crush these guys, Fujimaru!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Enemies destroyed.  
All that's left is the Servant back there.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Even corrupted, it's power is real.  
You'll need to kill it more than once or twice.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It means we need to keep killing him.  
Let's do this, Master.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
W-We did it!  
We won!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We did it, Mash!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It'll take more than a Berserker to stop me.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Emiya:**   
That was a splendid battle.  
You are no longer a novice.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh?  
No longer a novice, but not a true Master yet?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Is that really something for me to say?  
You still have some work for [♂ him /♀️ her}, right?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, for me this kid is doing a great job.  
But Magi☆Mari though...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're asking an internet idol for opinions on a Master's growth?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Of course I am, so much so she complains and says "that all you ever talk about now."  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...That may not be the best idea Doctor.  
Try not to stay on the internet all day.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Either way, that's all I have for you to do.  
Master, you may now order me as you like.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
How about fighting the real Berserker?  
I shall show you my mastery of the blade.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A Noble Phantasm battle between Archer and Berserker?  
Awesome! Make sure you win this time, Archer!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
That's up to my Master.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I'm counting on you, Fujimaru.  
Surpass the hero whom I couldn't before.
