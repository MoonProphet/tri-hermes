# Spartacus  
  
## Gladiator Circus  
  
**Spartacus:**   
Master! Ye who's not an oppressor,  
but destined to become an oppressor one day.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Yes. I see that you're confused.  
I understand, we're inside the camp of a Roman army.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
And at this moment, we're going to show them our strengths. So it seems that I cannot avoid my destiny for battle.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's going on?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where is this place?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Not to worry.  
We both share the same destiny.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Although if you do end up being an oppressor,  
I'll have no choice but to cut down your head&ndash;  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Perhaps, I should've cut you down the day you became my "Master." But for now... I shall accompany you.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Or, maybe... No, as long as you're a "Master"  
there's no use. It's sad, but that's destiny.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What happened?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Please listen to me.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Spartacus:**   
It is time now for battle and bloodshed. The road forward from here will be a living hell. Yes, my blood will seethe.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
And my muscles, organs, skin, and all that I am will tremble with delight!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um... Master, Master.  
I don't want to bother you when you look so confused.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;And I know this is sudden.  
But it looks like we're captured.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How come?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
All I know is that we were already like this when I woke up. See? Even Fou has cute little shackles on.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It seems that we will be forced to fight as combatants&ndash;as Gladiators.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
You there, puppets of the oppressor.  
Come out. I'll take you on as much as you like.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And what's making this even worse,  
Spartacus is really in the mood for a fight...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Rather than think our way out of this,  
it might be better for us to fight.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
All right, so we'll start with a warm-up, eh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, orders, please.  
All right, let's begin!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
It is over, sad and fragile.  
And no one would sing of their praises.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
They stood before us, without a shred of fear in their body, they charged at us.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Now that's courage. A great and might conviction,  
something an oppressor will never have.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Hail them! Hail these warriors!  
Not me, but them!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Master.  
Wait a little while longer before giving orders.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Ah-ha! You're next?  
Come at me!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-A lion?  
Master, your orders! This could be a real fight&ndash;!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;Or maybe not.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Now that I think about it, Spartacus was always renown for being a great gladiator.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
On this kind of battlefield, he can handle this all alone without a problem.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
&ndash;This stench! It reeks! This is the stench of impatience. Mixed with the stench of rage.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
It's the stench of animosity, that they will not let us return alive. In that case, I am already prepared!  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Monsters! Bring out the monsters that you people sealed away with your oppression!  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
That is their way to becoming free!  
For as long as our interests conflict, I will crush them!  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Yet, when all has ended, I shall weep! I will take their hands, and shed tears of blood for their destiny.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...This time, it is my turn...right?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Hmm. A warrior with the head of a beast, eh?  
I am ready. Let each of us now fight for our freedom!  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Wahahahahahahahahahahaha&ndash;!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
We've defeated the werebeasts&ndash;but.  
From what I can see, it looks like more are on the way!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Now it's&ndash;!  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Now it's the merging of a woman and a serpent.  
But, whoever appears before me shall be a warrior.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Will that torso of yours curl around me and crush me first? Or will my blade pierce your torso first.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
The bone crushing battle shall wait no longer!  
I'll gladly vanquish my foe!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Whew... When Spartacus got Lamia in that suplex,  
I wasn't sure how it would turn out.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
All right, what's next?  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Oh, another lion? ...No, it's not.  
This is...a lion, yet a lot more ferocious!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Could it be&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A Chimera?  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
What an abomination! Well, never in my lifetime have I encountered a creature like this!  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
The trembling that I feel is by no means my imagination.  
Let's do this, great lion!  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
I shall risk my life&ndash;to obtain my freedom!  
Gaaaaaaarrrrrrrrgh&ndash;!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Spartacus:**   
I am...victorious...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm exhausted...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well done!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You fought well!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
All right, what's next?...Hmm?  
What is the meaning of this?  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
The Roman soldiers have disappeared.  
The campsite is gone, too.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Hm. ...What's this? Now I'm troubled.  
What am I going to do now that the oppressor is gone.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
I was to regain my freedom after I defeat the oppressor.  
Now that he's gone, how am I going to...  
  
   
Wait! Could this be what true freedom&ndash;tastes like?  
Master, what do you think?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, let me see...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Wait, there're more oppressors out there in the world.  
My fight won't end until I've defeated them all.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Yes, without a doubt&ndash; Until that day arrives,  
you're coming with me to the depths of hell.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Oh, my Master!
