# Bedivere  
  
## Even at the Cost of My Life  
  
**Bedivere:**   
Good morning, Master.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
What do you have planned today?  
I shall accompany you, no matter your destination.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Rayshifting?  
Perhaps training in the simulator?  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
After all, I am here on behalf of Miss Mash today.  
I will try my very best to be of help to you.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait, what's wrong with Mash?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Now that you mention it...  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Miss Mash is having her medical check today.  
I understand she must remain in the exam room all day.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Medical checks are important. As you are aware, Chaldea is isolated from the rest of the world, and located in an extreme environment.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Our bodies and minds are under incredible pressure... We must always be aware of this.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Of course, we face the unprecedented threat that is the Incineration of Humanity.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
And while the flames we face and the biting cold of Chaldea's environment are quite different in nature...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
They can both be said to be exceptionally difficult environments.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
That is the challenge that everyone here in Chaldea faces. Yourself included, Master.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
As such, frequent checkups are of critical importance. Understood?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay!  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Very good.  
A most excellent response.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thanks for looking out for me.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...Your words humble me.  
  
   
---  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Permit me to remind you once more:  
I am here as a substitute for Miss Mash today.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
As such, please ask me for anything. I am your attendant, your butler. I am your Servant today in every possible sense of the word.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
How about training in the simulator? Or observing and monitoring the remnants from the Singularities would be appropriate as well.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...Battling to gain something is what will lead to further growth for you, Master.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Battles for the sake of the Grand Order...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Or rather, battles to continue your survival,  
will eventually wear you down.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Your soul. Your psyche.  
Or speaking in modern terms, your nerves.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nerves wearing down...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Modern terms? That's more of a medical term.  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
There is one thing that crossed my mind, Master.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Normally, I wouldn't dare mention something like this to others...but in your particular case...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I'm sure HE would be happy about it,  
without a doubt. He is that kind of knight.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
While any such approval given would be...ex post facto, unworthy though I am, I shall eventually gain it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
When you said knight...?  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Yes. Actually...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
My comrade, the man who is the epitome of freedom,  
Sir Tristan, heads out to a certain place in every free moment he has.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Occasionally, I accompany him.  
I believe it is a wonderful place to relax.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
But please, keep that to yourself...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I will!  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Thank you very much.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where is it? The Rec room?  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Haha.  
Is that where you think it is?  
  
---  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Let's head over there right away.  
I will leave a note for Sir Tristan.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Let's go!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The sea...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So it's not outside, but in the simulator.  
  
---  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
You're less enthused than expected...  
My apologies...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Perhaps I built up your expectations too much...  
I must reflect on my presentation.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
As you can see, this is a virtual creation in the simulator. We are not actually outside Chaldea.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Still, it gives me a sense of peace.  
I hope it works for you as well, Master.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Initially, even I was skeptical about whether or not this would work.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I accompanied Sir Tristan to watch him go fishing and listen to his ranting that was nothing but difficult to understand...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
There was nothing in particular to do except to spend time just watching the sky and sea.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
But...surprisingly, doing so felt peaceful,  
or rather, it calmed me.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
And I wanted you to experience that same sense of peace, or at least calming effect.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...Have I...overstepped my boundaries?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, taking a break sometimes is nice.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No. Let's relax together, Bedivere.  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Thank you, Master.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Then...how about this?  
Would you like to try night fishing?  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Sir Tristan uses his Failnaught so skillfully to catch a great many fish.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Darn, we don't have fishing gear.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Ah, but we do.  
I had Miss Da Vinci prepare us some.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
In that much, I planned ahead. I am excited to provide you with the best fishing experience ever.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't we need to have entered that data beforehand?  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Do not fret.  
I requested Miss Da Vinci's help on that front.  
  
   
---  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I believe I open up the multipurpose window...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Now I equip the extra item...and we're all set.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Well, I'm sure there are other ways to do so, but I don't have as much experience with the simulator...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I understand Miss Jing Ke is quite well-versed in such things. She even brings things like alcohol with her, I am told.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
But let's do it this way for today.  
After you, Master.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
The bait is already on the hook, so please cast it out to sea with all your might.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hi-yah!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Wonderful.  
Excellent, Fujimaru.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Arraaaghh!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Such bold and brazen movement...!  
Amazing!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Wonderful!  
Have you by chance tried fishing before?  
  
   
---  
   
**Bedivere:**   
And now...the main event.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Well, there is nothing special to do now. At night, when the boundaries between the sky and sea are blurred, we just listen to the waves...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
And please relax.  
There's no need to feel rushed or impatient.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Please, sit back and enjoy this leisure time.  
I will watch your line, so please do not worry.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
---  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...This is something that I've never said before...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Nor did Tristan say this...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
But at times, I find myself thinking this:  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Tristan was torn between the two Iseults.  
And his fate led him to lose his life by the water.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Or rather, his soul...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Perhaps that is why he cannot be apart from the water. Even now, he could be waiting for that ship with the shining, pale white sail...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Bedivere, tell me a story.  
  
---  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...Shh, Master.  
Empty your thoughts...your mind.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I am not saying you must enter an Eastern meditative state. Just...let yourself go. Calm. Peace.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Just watch the boundaries of the sea and sky to melt together, and doze into the blanket of night...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Let your daily stresses wash away.  
  
   
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Something's biting!  
It's splashing!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
It must be a big one...!  
It's like Sir Kay swimming amongst the fishes!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
This may be even bigger than that!  
I've never seen such an intense tug on a fishing line!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
It could be a red snapper, mackerel, or even a tuna!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Let's reel it in, Master!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Just like humans take pictures of fish to record their greatest catches, we can capture its data and show it off to Miss Mash and Sir Tristan!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
It's sure to make them smile!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay, let's do this!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Reeeeeel!  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
You did it!  
The fish just popped out of the sea!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...That's...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
The fish we caught is...actually, not a fish...  
  
   
**Fish?:**  
Gueeeeeeeeeaaahhh!!!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What the hell is this!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's an enemy!  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Oh I'm so embarrassed...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I must have made some kind of mistake when I set up the system. Doing something one is unaccustomed to can cause such trouble...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I pulled an all-nighter studying the manual...but I am no good at learning new things...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
No, now's not the time for lamentations!  
Master, your commands!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I am prepared to make amends for my misconduct. Or, rather, I am prepared to accept whatever punishment you deem fitting. But first, we have an enemy to fight!  
  
   
**C：Bedivere:**   
I swear by my Airgetlám that I will dispose of this immediately!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course! Let's do this, Bedivere!  
  
---  
   
  
   
**C：Bedivere:**   
Switch On - Airgetlám!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**B：Bedivere:**   
Dead End, Airgetlám!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Please, allow me to apologize once more.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Even thought it was only in the simulator,  
my most important job is to keep you safe...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
It appears my efforts were fruitless once again...I'm sorry, Fujimaru.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There is nothing to forgive, Bedivere.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nobody got hurt, so no problem.  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Thank you very much.  
I am undeserving of such kindness.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Now...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
It would be a waste to leave this, so let's eat it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Pardon?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't really understand.  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I have memories from my previous life. For instance, from Round Table analects, King Arthur, number eight:  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
“Food is all the same.  
Nutrition is nutrition, even monster meat!”  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Now, Master...repeat!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh right...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Bedivere's kind of crazy like that!  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
What are you talking about? Master?  
Why are you backing away? Master!?  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...Once again, my apologies.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
But I'm glad. You cleaned your plate completely.  
Now that I've learned more about your food preferences...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
In order for you to enjoy my dishes more in the future,  
I will continue to hone my skills.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
By the way...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where are we...?  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
The seaside we visited is Sir Tristan's place of relaxation. Now we are at mine.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
It's quite similar to a certain place in Britain.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
A place of peace... Well, admittedly this tranquil place is where I allow my mind to race.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
It is a place that helps me renew my resolve and reinvigorate my soul. So it may be a stretch to call this place a place of peace.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Bedivere?  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Care to share?  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...Yes, Master.  
  
   
---  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Our Britain was a nation under constant threat of attack, never peaceful or stable.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Many fell victim to that strife,  
and I could do nothing to save them.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
The Giant of Mont Saint-Michel. A fearsome giant was wreaking havoc on Mont Saint-Michel of Brittany...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...and kidnapped Princess Helena,  
the niece of the King of Brittany.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Our King Arthur took Sir Kay and myself to hunt the giant down and rescue her.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
On that quest...to be honest...I was of no help to the two of them.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
King Arthur and Sir Kay defeated the giant in a gruesome battle and brought some peace to Brittany.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
On the other hand, I...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...I could not save the princess.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I was too late, powerless as I am.  
All too little, too late.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Princess Helena, known for her grace, had her young and promising life plucked away, and we found only her pitiful corpse.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I couldn't save the people dear to me.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
First, Princess Helena.  
Then, the Battle of Camlann, my king...Arthur...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I failed...not once, but twice...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Bedivere...  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...This place...it reminds me of where Princess Helena drew her last breath.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Every time I stand here, it reminds me...that I am a powerless knight.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I am but a man who lost the two people he swore to protect.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
This is the place where I vowed never to repeat those mistakes. Ever.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Master, I am a weak, powerless man who does not deserve to be numbered among the Knights of the Round Table.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
And yet&ndash;No, because of that, I offer you this vow, knowing that my manifestation here was truly a miracle:  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I shall protect you, Master, who fights these brutal battles to defend humanity's future.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
No matter how powerful our coming enemies may be...no matter how cruel the fate we face may be...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Your life...your heart...your body...  
I shall protect you till the very end.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you, Sir Bedivere.  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...Yes, Fujimaru.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I believe you.  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I swear that I will live up to your expectations, Fujimaru.
