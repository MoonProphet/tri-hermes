# Siegfried  
  
## Dragon Slayer  
  
**Siegfried:**   
Ah Master, Mash Kyrielight, I need a word with you...  
Is now a good time?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't mind.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Not a problem.  
  
---  
   
  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, I don't mind.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...I see.  
Well, where to start...  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
You know how I am the "Dragon Slayer?"  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Of course, you defeated the evil dragon Fafnir, didn't you?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Yes. Afterward I bathed in its blood&ndash;  
and gained immortality from it.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Although, there is one part which was untouched by its blood. My back.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...Well, that I'm aware of, at least.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why wasn't it touched?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why did you leave it?  
  
---  
   
  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Let's just say I had my reasons.  
I'm terrible at explaining this.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
You see, because I bathed in Fafnir's blood&ndash;  
I can resonate with "that dragon."  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
You could say it's like the relationship between Masters and Servants.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
However, the link is extremely weak. It only allows us to confirm each other's survival at best.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
During the battle in France, I was certain that Fafnir was destroyed, but...  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
It seems it's revived.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wha...Fafnir has?!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Master, I beg of you.  
Return to France, and this time slay the dragon.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Won't you take me with you?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All right, I'll start monitoring...  
Multiple signatures of lifeforms confirmed.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It goes without saying, they're not human.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please look at this, Master!  
There are wyverns among them!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Did they survive that battle then recover?  
Or were they reborn?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...In any case, they must be destroyed.  
Aim for the wyverns first. Let's go!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Siegfried:**   
...It looks like we got them for now.  
Let's look for Fafnir.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A ruined fortress.  
It looks like the wyverns attacked it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But Doctor, I thought Fafnir was summoned by that Jeanne.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's possible she, too is&ndash;  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...No, I doubt that.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Siegfried's correct.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
She needed the Grail to exist as a Servant, there's no sign of it in France.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I'm sure.  
...I fear this is my fault.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yours?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
By defeating Fafnir, I left behind a legend and became a Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
But, my very existence itself is also the proof that "Fafnir exists."  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Not to mention it's already been summoned once here in France.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
So long as Fafnir isn't killed completely, it will keep reviving.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But I thought its Master, Jeanne no longer exists...  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Dragons generates magical energy simply by breathing.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&ndash;I see. Standing atop of all Phantasmals,  
they never have to worry about magical energy.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Living. Just by doing that,  
it's possible to generate magical energy!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, it's the wyverns!  
They've formed a pack and started to attack!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
It's not easy being a "Dragon Slayer."  
Master, let's go!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Siegfried:**   
&ndash;Hm.  
These wyverns were just born.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Born?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
When dragons become as large as Fafnir, they can bear offspring on their own.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Just like these.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Most of them are dead, but even if a few survive&ndash;  
they'll eventually be surrounded by strong fantasies.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Then new Evil Dragons will be born.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
It's because of that fear, we humans desperately fought the dragons.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Weren't you afraid?  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're brave.  
  
---  
   
  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I appreciate that, Master.  
Unfortunately, I was afraid.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I only killed the dragon because I was asked to.  
I suppose I'm the type who&ndash;just can't refuse a request.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
To all warriors, the title Dragon Slayer was an eternal honor. ...I won't deny that I was motivated by fame.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
But, it was so scary I regretted it immediately.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You still ended up victorious, right?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Yes, but as I said before, even I don't know how I won.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
When I came to, there was the bloody dragon and my bloodstained self. Its lair was dyed red.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
My skin which should have been badly burned was hardly hurt. ...It was strange, but I knew I had won.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Were you happy?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Of course. The dragon was slain and I thought I could devote my entire life to realizing that.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Was it fun?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...Yes, it was fun.  
The moment I realized it, I gave an uncharacteristic shout.  
  
   
---  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
The treasure I gained eventually cast me into misfortune,  
but... I have no regrets or hesitations.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I know it's not the most enlightened way to put it,  
but I accepted the circumstances of my life.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I grant someone's wish.  
I accept their joy, their sadness, and their rage.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...And that was enough to give my life fulfillment.  
Except&ndash;  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
!!!  
It seems our idle chatter is at an end.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I've located it&ndash;  
Which means it's located me, as well.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I've picked up a massive signature incoming...  
No doubt about it, it's Fafnir!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Now is the time to settle this!  
Let's go!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Siegfried:**   
...Farewell Fafnir.  
May you be destroyed, this time.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is Mash.  
Fafnir's destruction confirmed.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, I've confirmed its destruction on my side as well.  
I'm scanning, but there's no sign at all.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I think you managed to finish him off this time.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Now it seems Balmung too has regained its original power.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can you continue with your story?  
  
---  
   
  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...There's nothing more to tell.  
We'll talk more next time we get the chance.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I'm grateful, let's return Master.  
  
  
## In Search of Das Rheingold  
  
**Siegfried:**   
Master, Mash Kyrielight.  
Forgive me, but I have a request.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is it Fafnir again&ndash;?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
No, that dragon was completely destroyed.  
Please rest assured.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
But when the dragon revived, so did my lost Noble Phantasm. We must return to France and secure it&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We've arrived.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...It's just as Siegfried said.  
I can sense a powerful presence.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I can confirm that, as well.  
Hang on while I find the shortest route.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's the Noble Phantasm?  
  
---  
   
  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Have you never heard of the Rheingold?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Rheingold  
...The treasure you obtained.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I've heard it's a mountain of treasures that couldn't be exhausted even by all the people of the era.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
That's an exaggeration.  
But it's enough to allow me, my children&ndash;  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
and even my grandchildren to grow old in luxury and still have some left over.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
It's likely an aftereffect of Fafnir's resurrection.  
The Rheingold has been summoned, as well.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
There's evil surrounding the gold.  
If we don't secure it, there will be trouble.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Trouble how?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
For example... Suppose a man finds it. With one glance, the treasure would captivate him completely.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
The captivated man would naturally spend the treasure.  
Once he did, he would become known as its owner.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Eventually, everything around him&ndash;will be drawn into a bloody struggle.  
The battle will drag on and spread like fire, without end.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
In the end, the nation will be consumed by atrocities and executions, treachery and perfidy.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
That's what Rheingold is.  
I regret having ever summoned it...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. We need to prevent that from happening. Let's hurry to the location!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I've got the route.  
Hurry!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...The gold has begun to attract evil creatures.  
Let's break through, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Siegfried:**   
Hm...  
  
   
**Soldier A:**   
That treasure...  
belongs to me!  
  
   
**Soldier B:**   
Quiet!  
That's mine!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
We're too late.  
The mind corruption has already begun.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
We can disable them for now.  
Master, let's go!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Will they be all right?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Once the Rheingold disappears from this nation, any related memories will also be erased and return to normal.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Let's hurry before we have casualties.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We're almost at our destination.  
However, I am picking up multiple signatures around it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's spacious.  
...Master, please stand back.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The signatures the Doctor mentioned are approaching!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
We're done once we defeat these.  
What?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
...It's been a while, my friend.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
You're!?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
No need to be surprised.  
You're not the only one who obtained the Rheingold.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
I, Hagen, killed you to acquire it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hagen...I believe he was the one who killed Siegfried from behind...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It seems he was summoned using the Rheingold as the catalyst.  
  
   
**Hagen:**   
Exactly. Though, I only did it because this guy asked me.  
Right, my friend?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...If you think of me as a friend, stand aside Hagen.  
  
   
**Hagen:**   
I refuse. This treasure is mine.  
I killed you to obtain it.  
  
   
**Hagen:**   
I won't give it to a wench like Kriemhild.  
I won't give it to a coward like you who chose death!  
  
   
**Hagen:**   
This gold! This treasure!  
Everything is mine!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
&ndash;No matter what I say, it will only be an excuse.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
It's true that I am a coward. I should have stood firm,  
and found a way to break through.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
That tragedy was not one I schemed...  
Even then, there's no doubt that I am responsible.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...However.  
I will retrieve the Rheingold.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Not for my own greed,  
but because it is just.  
  
   
**Hagen:**   
&ndash;Haha. Says the man who wielded his sword not knowing what is just!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
You're correct. When I was alive,  
I wielded my sword in ignorance.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
However, lately I have finally been able to see my own righteousness.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I will have my wish granted&ndash;  
Hagen!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Hagen:**   
&ndash;Hmph, ruin it is.  
That's fine, I didn't want this gold in the first place.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
What, you were just venting?  
  
   
**Hagen:**   
What else did you think it was?  
  
   
**Hagen:**   
...I was happy when I could drink and joke with you.  
  
   
**Hagen:**   
I'm the only one that could have assaulted you from behind in that situation.  
  
   
**Hagen:**   
I can see you wanted it to be by my blade, as you trusted me.  
  
   
**Hagen:**   
However&ndash;did you not imagine that you would hurt my heart doing so?  
  
   
**Hagen:**   
Did you not think it would infuriate your wife Kriemhild?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...You're right.  
Seems I knew little about emotions.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
No, more than anything else&ndash;since I was asked to,  
I believed nothing else could have been done.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I showed excessive lack of interest in everything.  
  
   
**Hagen:**   
You neglected your life, your hope, and most of all your desires.  
  
   
**Hagen:**   
You may have been fine with that, but you should've noticed those around you couldn't bear it.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...Yeah.  
  
   
**Hagen:**   
Then, let me ask you.  
&ndash;Do you have any wish as you are now?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I do. I had decided this from before. In this second life&ndash; I'll protect justice, and be proud of it.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I care not about the opinions of others.  
I merely wish that "I myself want to be as such."  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
My dream is&mdash;to be a hero of justice.  
  
   
**Hagen:**   
...Hmph, such a childish dream, much like you.  
But that is fine.  
  
   
**Hagen:**   
I will entrust the Rheingold to you.  
I'm sure you'll be able to deal with it properly&mdash;  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Master, this is what I couldn't tell you earlier.  
I neglected myself too much, and ended up causing tragedy.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I will not repeat my mistake again.  
I want to become a hero of justice and prevent it.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Is it absurd...  
to wish for that?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not at all.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It is not absurd.  
  
---  
   
  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...Thank you Master.  
I give you my best regards for the future.
