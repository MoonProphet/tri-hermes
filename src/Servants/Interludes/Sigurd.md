# Sigurd  
  
## With Neither Mass Nor Shape, Yet Real  
  
**Narration:**   
...My inner fire continues to burn.  
  
**Narration:**   
It scorches my body, singes my heart,  
sears my passion, and sublimates my bliss.  
  
**Narration:**   
Even after all this time,  
my flames show not a single sign of deterioration.  
  
**Narration:**   
They reject the cold,  
and melt any ice or snow that draws near.  
  
**Narration:**   
Even now, this power that lies within  
me burns as fiercely as ever.  
  
**Narration:**   
Yes...even now.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Stew's ready, Sigurd.  
  
  
---  
  
**Sigurd:**   
You are too kind, Master.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
While we Servants have no need for sustenance, I would be happy to partake if there is enough to go around.  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh yes, there's plenty. So much that you'd  
be doing us a favor by helping us eat it.  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou fou.  
  
**Martha:**   
I'm so sorry. I always seem to end up making enough to feed a whole family when it's my turn to cook.  
  
**Martha:**   
I'm sure it would be great if there were a large number of us camping out, but when it's only a few of us, I always feel like I'm being careless and wasteful.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hey, as far as I'm concerned, the important thing is that your food is yummy.  
  
**Martha:**   
Oh, well thank you, Master. I'm glad to hear that.  
We cooks can always use more positive feedback.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't mind. It's like a decadent feast!  
  
**Martha:**   
Well, that's kind of you to say, Master.  
...That WAS a compliment, right?  
  
  
---  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Hmm, this food is somehow...heartwarming.  
Is this what home cooking usually tastes like?  
  
**Martha:**   
I'm not sure. This is usually what meals were  
like back when I cooked for my own family...  
  
**Martha:**   
...but I don't know if that alone  
qualifies it as home cooking.  
  
**Martha:**   
Still, as long as the food is hot and nutritious, and everyone can relax and be themselves while they eat it, I think that's all you need.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I see, I see.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I ask because, as something of an older hero myself,  
I tend to forget what home cooking was like.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You do?  
  
  
---  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I do.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
You see... (Munch) While my mother did raise me...  
(Munch, munch)  
  
**Martha:**   
Stop that! Didn't your mother teach you not to talk with your mouth full? A great hero should be setting a much better example!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...Yes, you're right. My apologies.(Munch, munch)...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Now he's savoring every bite...)  
  
  
---  
  
**Martha:**   
...Well, that doesn't mean we need to eat in complete silence, either. I'm happy to talk during meals, as long as we don't do so while chewing.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Good point.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...My father, the great warrior Sigmund,  
died in battle when I was still a baby.  
  
**Martha:**   
...  
  
**Martha:**   
I see. I'm sorry for your loss.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Fortunately, I was not yet of fighting age, or he may have given me a baby battle instead of a baby bottle.  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
**Martha:**   
Bwa!?  
  
**Martha:**   
Why would you say such a thing!?  
It doesn't even make sense!  
  
**Martha:**   
Gah! Never mind!  
Let's just forget that last part!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Forgive me. Once I get a joke in my head,  
I simply cannot stop myself from saying it.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Even my beloved has told me less is more  
when it comes to my attempts at humor.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
At any rate, after my father's death, my mother took a new husband, and a blacksmith friend of the family was entrusted with my care.  
  
**Mash:**   
And that was&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You mean Regin?  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Indeed, I do.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
If you are familiar with my legend,  
that will save us time.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What was this blacksmith like?  
  
**Sigurd:**   
His name was Regin,  
and he raised me as though I were his own son.  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Was he strict?  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Of course.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
He had to be, to ensure I would grow up to be a hero.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Thus, I was trained to be a hero from a very young age.  
  
**Narration:**   
I was taught swordsmanship. Spear handling.  
Archery. Axe theory.  
  
**Narration:**   
I learned how to fight with every weapon under the sun, and still I hungered greedily for even more knowledge.  
  
**Narration:**   
My curriculum also included mandatory physical training.  
  
**Narration:**   
From sunrise to sunset, I would run nonstop across the plains without disturbing so much as a blade of grass.  
  
**Narration:**   
I learned how to hunt beasts,  
and how to incapacitate people.  
  
**Narration:**   
I mastered ways to defeat soldiers, warriors, and heroes, and how to fight on equal ground against those of more demonic natures.  
  
**Narration:**   
My training began practically the day I was born. As long as I can remember, I knew I was destined to become a hero, and had made my peace with it.  
  
**Narration:**   
But despite what you might think,  
I did not think of it as a burden...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...No, on second thought, I suppose I did.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
The words were out of my mouth  
before I knew what I was saying.  
  
**Martha:**   
I see... I don't blame you.  
I can only imagine how hard that must have been.  
  
**Martha:**   
Though I am surprised to hear you say that, Sigurd. You always seemed like the type to keep those kinds of thoughts to yourself.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
True, I suppose I usually am.  
But in this case...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I thought that with my beloved elsewhere, and only a few comrades in arms I trust with my life here...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...I could permit myself a moment of vulnerability and share how I truly feel.  
  
**Mash:**   
...  
  
**Martha:**   
...  
  
**Martha:**   
Ahem! W-well go on, keep eating. The food's  
certainly not getting any warmer, after all.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You caught Martha completely off guard!  
  
  
---  
  
**Martha:**   
What did I just say!?  
...Still, can you blame me?  
  
**Martha:**   
I think anyone would be touched to be trusted so implicitly by someone from such a different time and place.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Hahaha, I do apologize if I embarrassed you.  
  
**Martha:**   
At any rate, I can scarcely imagine how hard  
that kind of life must have been for you.  
  
**Martha:**   
But if nothing else, I can certainly pray for you.  
  
**Martha:**   
Consider it a sign of respect for the conviction that helped you get through those hard times and become the hero you are today.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
You may well be right, Lady Martha.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
It was a difficult time in my life, to be sure...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...but since I would not be here today had I not experienced it, I can look back on it fondly.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
That being said, if I were to encounter Regin now,  
I have no doubt I would punch him right in his face again.  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou fou...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Indeed.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
While we are on the subject&ndash;I would not normally tell you this next part, but since it is already part of my legend, I see no reason to refrain.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Unfortunately, Regin deceived me. He planned to make off with the evil dragon's treasure after I slew it...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...even if it meant killing me to get me out of his way.  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh gosh. That's...terrible.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Indeed. But by then, he was no match for me,  
and I quickly turned the tables on him.  
  
**Martha:**   
I, uh, I see. You're very proud of that, aren't you?  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Of course.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I've never thought of myself as a righteous hero...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...but surely, anyone who could stoop so low as to stab a child he raised in the back must be irredeemably evil.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
So I think my killing him in retaliation must therefore have been a righteous act.  
  
**Martha:**   
Yes, you do have a point. There certainly isn't much good to say about a man who would betray his charge for riches.  
  
**Mash:**   
...Do you hate Regin for what he did to you, Sigurd?  
  
**Sigurd:**   
......  
  
**Sigurd:**   
No, I don't think so. I don't have much love for him now, but I wouldn't say I especially hate him either.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
No, I don't hate him. But it did pain me that things turned out how they did.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
If nothing else, I do owe him a debt of gratitude for his work raising me to be the hero I became.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
And above all, I would never have met my  
beloved had he not set me on that path.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I suppose it just goes to show there is a thin line  
between good fortune and bad.  
  
**Martha:**   
Don't you think you're being a little overly optimistic?  
  
**Sigurd:**   
......Now that you mention it...!  
  
**Martha:**   
Oh come now!  
Surely there's no need to be that shocked about it!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
It's just that I'm usually so straitlaced that no one has ever called me optimistic before.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I never even realized it until now...  
I see. So I'm an optimist...  
  
**Martha:**   
Arguably, one of the best parts of being a Servant is  
getting to better understand who we are even after we die.  
  
**Martha:**   
Now that you know you're an optimist, you should work on polishing your optimistic nature.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I see.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
From where I stand, it appears you  
are also an optimist, Lady Martha.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
For it is through your heart of iron wrapped in gentle  
mercy that you bring hope to people everywhere.  
  
**Martha:**   
Oh?... Now that you mention it,  
I suppose I probably am an optimist.  
  
**Martha:**   
But that's okay. I think it's much better to be an incurable optimist than to bemoan the state of the world without doing anything to improve it.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
With that attitude, it is little wonder you became a saint. My mask&ndash;er, hat is off to you.  
  
**Martha:**   
It's a little embarrassing,  
hearing you praise me like that...  
  
**Martha:**   
Thank you once again for this meal, O Lord.  
  
**Martha:**   
At any rate, I'm still wondering if there truly  
is an evil dragon in this Singularity.  
  
**Martha:**   
What do you make of it, Sieg?  
  
**Sieg:**   
They're definitely the same species as me...  
Well, that might not be entirely accurate...  
  
**Sieg:**   
But whatever species they are, I can definitely sense  
them here. Also, on a completely different subject,  
the stew is delicious, Martha.  
  
**Martha:**   
Thank you, Sieg.  
I made sure to season your bowl extra strong.  
  
**Sieg:**   
I appreciate that.  
  
**Sieg:**   
My tongue isn't as sensitive as humans', so I need strong flavors just to taste anything at all.  
  
**Sieg:**   
...Mmm, this really is delicious.  
  
**Martha:**   
I'm glad to hear that.  
  
**Martha:**   
All right, once you're done with dinner, we'll get back to searching. And this time, we're going to find those dragons and take care of them once and for all.  
  
**Martha:**   
And by take care of, I mean confront them and lay them to rest with mercy and prayer.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Lead the way, Ms. Iron Fist!  
  
**Martha:**   
How many times do I have to tell you!? I'm a Rider!  
A Rider devoted solely to healing others!  
  
**Sieg:**   
(Why is she upset?  
Does she not like being called “Ms.”?)  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
With a lineup like this, I don't see how we can lose.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Indeed.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Between two renowned dragon slayers like myself and  
Lady Martha, I almost feel sorry for our targets.  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
All right then, shall we get going?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(I was kind of hoping for seconds...)  
  
**Martha:**   
Don't worry, Master. If you liked my stew that much, I'd be happy to make another pot for you after we get back.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Could I partake in this new pot of stew as well?  
  
**Martha:**   
Well of course. Like I said, I always make too much anyway. When it comes to cooking for large groups, I daresay I could even give Cat a run for her money.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's do it!  
  
**Sieg:**   
Right.  
  
**Sieg:**   
I like to think I've known for some  
time now how Siegfried fights...  
  
**Sieg:**   
...so I'm really looking forward to fighting  
alongside you for the first time, Sigurd.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I see. Well, since one of a hero's duties is to  
live up to young boys' expectations for them...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...I'll have to do my best to show off what I can do then.  
  
  
---  
  
**Narration:**   
I don't smile. I can't smile.  
I don't need to smile.  
  
**Narration:**   
I don't get angry. I can't get angry.  
I don't need to get angry.  
  
**Narration:**   
I don't get sad. I can't get sad.  
I don't need to get sad.  
  
**Narration:**   
...Nor do I ever particularly wish for happiness.  
  
**Narration:**   
The blacksmith who raised me said that was fine.  
  
**Narration:**   
He said I was a weapon, a blade, a guardian meant to protect those who can't protect themselves.  
  
**Narration:**   
He also said if I was going to be a hero, I shouldn't try to develop a personality of my own, as doing so would only end in tragedy one day.  
  
**Narration:**   
Though his words stung, I couldn't deny that there was a hint of truth to them.  
  
**Narration:**   
If one were to assemble a group of one million people, ten thousand of them would no doubt be well above average.  
  
**Narration:**   
Let's say that from those ten thousand,  
a hundred of the very best were chosen.  
  
**Narration:**   
That would mean that there were no fewer than a hundred people who excelled in every possible way&ndash;mental, physical, and spiritual alike.  
  
**Narration:**   
And among those hundred...  
there is one truly exceptional being.  
  
**Narration:**   
They may be descended from gods...bring miracles  
 to life...have wills like solid steel...or possess  
inhuman power.  
  
**Narration:**   
Those beings are called heroes.  
  
**Narration:**   
They are birthed by the tides of history,  
and cultivated by the passions of their fellows.  
  
**Narration:**   
I expect that I, too, am one of them.  
  
**Narration:**   
As long as this power of mine can be of use to the world, I have no qualms about materializing and wielding my sword.  
  
**Narration:**   
But...there is also something else.  
An itch that is somehow indescribably pleasant.  
  
**Narration:**   
Something about it feels nearly dreamlike.  
It's almost as if&ndash;  
  
**Martha:**   
#### Sigurd!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...!  
  
**Martha:**   
What happened!? How could a warrior of  
your caliber become so distracted!?  
  
**Sieg:**   
Were you so nice and full from that delicious  
meal that you got sleepy or something?  
  
**Sigurd:**   
No, nothing like that. Forgive me.  
I was simply a bit lost in thought.  
  
**Martha:**   
Oh, thank goodness. I was worried you had  
been hit with some sort of mental attack.  
  
**Martha:**   
Though in that case, I'm impressed you can afford to get lost in thought while we face such a fearsome opponent.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I'm sorry.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Rest assured, I will do everything I can to allay your concerns, starting right now.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
What are your orders, Master!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hit it hard, and bring it down quickly.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Understood. Then I would ask that you please  
send some more magical energy my way.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Thank you, Master.  
All right, beast...have at you!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Martha, Sieg, I'd like you to back Sigurd up.  
  
**Martha:**   
Leave it to me. I'll make sure to heal every injury sustained, down to the slightest scratch.  
  
**Sieg:**   
I'll cover you with my Noble Phantasm.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Then I'll lead the charge against this beast.  
Let's go!  
  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Sigurd:**   
There we go.  
All the creatures have been destroyed, Master.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Great work, team!  
  
  
---  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Thank you.  
  
**Martha:**   
Don't let your guard down just yet.  
We still haven't finished repairing this Singularity.  
  
**Martha:**   
And Sigurd, I think you still owe us an explanation  
for why you spaced out in the middle of battle.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Yes, I suppose I do.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Letting your mind wander in the heat of battle is inexcusable.  
  
**Narration:**   
  
Still...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I got careless.  
I'm sorry.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I-it's okay. These things happen.  
  
  
---  
  
**Sieg:**   
I'm surprised. I never thought I'd see the  
day when you of all people slipped up.  
  
**Mash:**   
I was kind of surprised, too...  
  
**Martha:**   
...(Sigh) Fortunately, we were able to cover for your mistake this time, but we might not be so lucky next time.  
  
**Martha:**   
Still, whatever's going on, if you believe you can figure it out on your own, please make sure you do so.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I will. Don't worry. It won't happen again.  
  
**Sieg:**   
...?  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Is something wrong?  
  
**Sieg:**   
Oh, no, it's nothing.  
Just my imagination.  
  
**Sieg:**   
(Though for a moment there, it really did look to me like he was enjoying himself...)  
  
**Sieg:**   
...  
  
**Sieg:**   
I'm sensing more dragonkin a little further ahead.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can you tell how many there are?  
  
  
---  
  
**Sieg:**   
There are lots of small ones, two medium-sized ones,  
and one big one.  
  
**Sieg:**   
Based on everything I've sensed so far, I'm guessing the small ones are wyverns, the medium ones are dragons...  
  
**Sieg:**   
...and the big one is a Fafnir.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Then perhaps this Singularity will  
go away once we take care of them?  
  
**Martha:**   
I think it probably will, yes.  
Though of course, that's easier said than done.  
  
**Martha:**   
These evil Fafnir dragons are always formidable foes I prefer to avoid, no matter how many times I've faced them.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Indeed.  
  
**Sieg:**   
Come to think of it, Siegfried says he doesn't remember anything about his own battle against Fafnir.  
  
**Sieg:**   
He says even a single battle with stakes as  
high as those, where even one small mistake can lead to your  
death, is enough to drive a person to insanity...  
  
**Sieg:**   
And since his went on for so long, he no longer has  
any recollection of how he managed to come out on top.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
It's true. That sort of thing is quite  
common in fiercely fought battles.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
While I also remember that I won my battle against Fafnir, I couldn't tell you how I did so.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Much as I wish I could.  
  
**Martha:**   
Well, I assume you at least used that sword against it.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
That much is certain, yes.  
Still...it's strange.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I'm still remembered as a heroic dragon slayer to this day, even though it's been a staggeringly long time since I accomplished that feat.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...But right now, I think I remember my ordinary life much more than I do that fearsome battle.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not.  
  
**Martha:**   
Now you really aren't sounding like yourself. Of course  
it's a good thing, Sigurd. Of that, I have no doubt.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I hope you're right.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Maybe the same will be true for this journey to save humanity as well, and I'll remember the ordinary days far better than I will my battles.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that's probably a good thing.  
  
  
---  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Do you think so, Master?  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I see... That's very reassuring.  
  
**Sieg:**   
I might just be imagining things, but I'm sensing there are even more creatures in the cave up ahead now than there were earlier.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Well, that's not good.  
They must be birthing more to increase their numbers.  
  
**Martha:**   
That can't be right!  
How could they possibly grow up so fast!?  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Anything is possible in a Singularity.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
They may be close to a powerful leyline, or they may have attained the power of a Holy Grail...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Either way, the sooner we eliminate  
the threat, the better.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Roger that!  
  
  
---  
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Martha:**   
Yikes! They're absolutely everywhere!  
  
**Mash:**   
It's just like what happened in Orleans.  
  
**Mash:**   
We need to hurry, or they'll start reproducing  
faster than we can eradicate them!  
  
**Mash:**   
Master!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're counting on you to help us tip the scales with the big one, Sigurd!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Consider it done!  
  
**Mash:**   
We'll do our best to clear the way for you!  
Good luck, Sigurd!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's start by taking care of as many of the smaller ones as we can!  
  
**Martha & Sieg:**   
Understood!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Indeed. We must do something about  
the dragonkin first and foremost!  
  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Now!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
My demonic sword is complete; my ultimate technique  
is ready. The time of your demise is at hand!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
#### Bölverkr Gram!!!  
  
**Mash:**   
You did it! The enemy has completely vanished!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Good.  
  
**Martha:**   
#### Booyah!  
  
**Martha:**   
...Ahem.  
Wonderful job, everyone.  
  
**Martha:**   
It shouldn't be long before this  
Singularity repairs itself now.  
  
**Sieg:**   
Fujimaru&ndash;I mean, Master.  
  
**Sieg:**   
Shall we?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hell yeah we shall.  
  
  
---  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Oh?  
  
**Sieg:**   
Wooo.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wooo!  
  
  
---  
  
**Sigurd:**   
What was that?  
  
**Sieg:**   
It's called a high five.  
  
**Sieg:**   
I'm no expert, but apparently, it's some kind of ritual you do once a job is complete.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Hmm.  
Then I think I'll do the same.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wooo!  
  
  
---  
  
**Sigurd:**   
W-wooo.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...  
...Hmm. This is nice.  
  
**Mash:**   
Great work today, everyone.  
Let's head back now, shall we?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Way to go, guys!  
  
  
---  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Thank you.  
  
**Narration:**   
Strangely, I've found myself smiling  
much more ever since coming to Chaldea.  
  
**Narration:**   
I can't yet tell if that's a good thing,  
or a bad thing.  
  
**Narration:**   
Heroes aren't supposed to smile themselves.  
They're supposed to protect others' smiles.  
  
**Narration:**   
I don't remember if Regin told me that,  
or if I said it myself...  
  
**Narration:**   
But either way, the environment I'm in now is like nothing I could have imagined back when I was still alive.  
  
**Narration:**   
As a result, I think that, maybe...  
  
**Narration:**   
...I may have grown a little weaker.  
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...So please, give it to me straight, Master.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Do you think I've gotten weaker?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
If this is you weak, I can't imagine what strong looks like.  
  
**Mash:**   
It's true.  
  
**Mash:**   
We would have had a much more difficult time  
against Fafnir without your help.  
  
**Siegfried:**   
There you have it, Lord Sigurd. And I too can vouch that you are still as strong as ever.  
  
**Siegfried:**   
Tell us, why would you think otherwise?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Not even a little.  
  
**Siegfried:**   
Master is right.  
  
**Siegfried:**   
You are every bit as strong as you ever were.  
  
**Siegfried:**   
Tell us, what in the world made you think otherwise?  
  
  
---  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Well...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
For one, the fact that I let  
my guard down on the battlefield.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
But more significantly, it is the fact that I  
was once able to defeat Fafnir on my own...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...yet this time, I was unable to do so without  
assistance from other Servants.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
The only explanation I could think of  
was that...I must have grown weaker.  
  
**Siegfried:**   
True, there are definitely cases where we Servants  
are weaker now than when we were alive.  
  
**Siegfried:**   
For example, as a Saber,  
I can no longer use my Tarnkappe.  
  
**Siegfried:**   
In a vacuum, one could indeed conclude that we have grown weaker.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I knew it...  
  
**Siegfried:**   
However...  
  
**Siegfried:**   
It might sound contradictory, but I'm also certain I don't feel any weaker now than I did when I was alive.  
  
**Siegfried:**   
And the reason for that...is our Master.  
  
**Siegfried:**   
Well, [♂ him /♀️ her] and the other companions  
alongside whom we've fought.  
  
**Siegfried:**   
While these kinds of circumstances would never come about during an ordinary Holy Grail War, they allow us to draw on this power.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...I see. Yes, you're right.  
Thank you, Lord Siegfried.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
How can I repay you for your help?  
  
**Siegfried:**   
If you'd like to repay me, you can do so by sparring with a couple of people I know.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Oh?  
  
**Siegfried:**   
...Hehehe.  
  
**Siegfried:**   
In fact, this sparring session might just  
help you truly understand what I mean.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...?  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Good day. My name is Sigurd,  
and I'll be your sparring partner today.  
  
**Katsushika Hokusai:**   
Hell yeah! Siegfried told me all aboutcha.  
  
**Katsushika Hokusai:**   
This oughta get me another step closer  
ta bein' a bona fide swordmaster!  
  
**Sieg:**   
I'm a Caster, not a Saber...but I still tend to get involved in a lot of sword fights.  
  
**Sieg:**   
So I think this sparring session will  
be extremely educational for me.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...  
...Hehe.  
  
**Katsushika Hokusai:**   
Somethin' wrong, Sigurd?  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Oh, sorry. Not to worry, everything is fine.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Now, shall we get started?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm gonna fight on their side, 'kay?  
  
  
---  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Understood.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Then let us begin!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
You're fast, but your strokes are all over the place!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
It's natural to hesitate at times  
when using multiple weapons...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...so your first step is to make choosing  
which one to use as natural as breathing!  
  
**Katsushika Hokusai:**   
G-gotcha!  
  
**Sieg:**   
You're mine!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
You're still overly reliant on Lord  
Siegfried's sheer strength.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I can understand why you'd be in a hurry to end the fight, since you can only transform for a moment&ndash;  
  
**Sigurd:**   
But there's no need to rush. You still have plenty  
of breathing room to use that technique.  
  
**Sieg:**   
R-right!  
  
**Katsushika Hokusai:**   
Hraaaaaah!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Hmm.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
You're not hesitating, but that's made your attack patterns too simplistic.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
An effective combat strategy relies on a mixture of both truth and lies. I want you to come up with at least three options for attacking your opponent at any given time.  
  
**Katsushika Hokusai:**   
Y-yikes! That sounds way too complicated for me!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
If it helps, you could try thinking of  
these options as conditional reflexes.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Perhaps you could try assigning numbers to each move. For example, four, seven, two, five...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...could be something like that.  
Easy, right?  
  
**Both:**   
...  
  
**Sieg:**   
I think we still have a long way to go before  
I can start thinking like that...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Oh? Hmm... Well, there's nothing wrong with associating them with something else, either.  
  
**Katsushika Hokusai:**   
Yeah? In that case, do ya think I could try  
to think of 'em as paintins', Sigurd?  
  
**Katsushika Hokusai:**   
I'm just startin' ta get the faintest  
picture of how it could work here...  
  
**Katsushika Hokusai:**   
But I'm definitely way more familiar with paintins' than I am numbers.  
  
**Sieg:**   
In that case, I'll try thinking of  
my techniques as Servant classes.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
That sounds fine to me.  
  
**Katsushika Hokusai:**   
All right, Sieggy, whaddaya say we do this thing!?  
I'll go first!  
  
**Sieg:**   
“Sieggy”?  
  
**Sieg:**   
Well, all right. But I'll be going right after you!  
Come on, let's do it!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
That's it! Show me what you've got!  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Both:**   
(Huff, huff, huff...)  
  
**Sigurd:**   
There you go. Not bad at all.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
If you continue training regularly, it will only  
be a matter of time until you master the sword.  
  
**Katsushika Hokusai:**   
Woohooo! We're finally done!  
  
**Katsushika Hokusai:**   
Aw damn, I'm all outta juice.  
Don't think I can take another step.  
  
**Sieg:**   
I'd offer to carry you, but I'm afraid  
I've hit my limit, too... I'm sorry.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Those are the happiest exhausted faces I've ever seen...  
  
  
---  
  
**Sigurd:**   
All right, I suppose I'll just have  
to carry you both myself then.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
You know...that was a lot of fun.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...Hmm. That's not good.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I shouldn't be thinking about having fun.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why not? There's nothing wrong with enjoying yourself.  
  
  
---  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...Do you really think so?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
If you don't believe me,why don't you ask the person you trust more than anyone?  
  
  
---  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...Hmm.  
  
**Narration:**   
Heroes are defined by fighting.  
By protecting the weak. By never smiling.  
  
**Narration:**   
That's why smiling would only weaken me.  
  
**Narration:**   
...At least, that's what I thought.  
  
**Brynhild:**   
I see. So that's what happened.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
What do you think of my weakness, my beloved?  
  
**Brynhild:**   
...  
  
**Brynhild:**   
Oh, my dear Sigurd. You haven't grown weak at all.  
You're still as heroic as you ever were.  
  
**Brynhild:**   
Just as you once learned how to smile kindly  
around me many years ago...  
  
**Brynhild:**   
...you've now learned how to smile around many people.  
  
**Brynhild:**   
That's not a sign of weakness.  
  
**Brynhild:**   
It's a sign that you've become more human&ndash;  
more like the person you were meant to be.  
  
**Brynhild:**   
And I think it's wonderful.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I see...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Then I owe it all to you, my beloved Brynhild.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
If it had not been for the passion you inspired in me in life, or the loss I once grieved...  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...I would surely not be standing here before you now.  
  
**Brynhild:**   
Hehe. You never fail to make my heart beat faster.  
  
**Brynhild:**   
But that's just what I love about you...  
Honey.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Urk.  
That, uh...certainly took me by surprise.  
  
**Brynhild:**   
You're always throwing me for a loop, so it's only fair that I return the favor now and then.  
  
**Katsushika Hokusai:**   
Oooi! Oh, wait, that's my name.  
Hey, Siguuurd! We wanna train some more!  
  
**Katsushika Hokusai:**   
I just came up with a killer ultimate move,  
an' I was hopin' you'd let me try it out on...Aah!  
  
**Sieg:**   
I'm so sorry.  
We didn't mean to interrupt your alone time.  
  
**Sieg:**   
See, Oei?  
I told you we should've waited until morning.  
  
**Katsushika Hokusai:**   
W-w-well how was I s'posed ta know what ya meant!?  
  
**Katsushika Hokusai:**   
S-s-sorry for botherin' ya, Sigurd.  
I'll come back tomorrow!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Don't be silly, Hokusai. This is a new ultimate move we're talking about, right?  
  
**Sigurd:**   
I'd love to see what you came up with.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Beloved, would you mind lending them a hand?  
  
**Brynhild:**   
Of course not, Sigurd.  
  
**Sieg:**   
Actually, um... Would you mind if one more person  
joined us? He's been telling us, quote:  
  
**Sieg:**   
“I still have nooo idea why little old  
me became a Saber in the first place!”  
  
**Sieg:**   
...So I decided to bring him along, too.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Evening! Sorry to spoil your date!  
But I can't wait to have fun training with you!  
  
**Sigurd:**   
Heh... Of course you're welcome to train with us.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
But whether you have fun or not is up to you.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
My swordsmanship class is ninety-nine-percent  
uncompromising, one-percent kind understanding.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Y-y-y-yikes! I-I'll do my best to keep up!  
  
**Narration:**   
My inner feelings may no longer  
be like a fiercely burning fire.  
  
**Narration:**   
They may now be more merciful,  
like the gentle rays of spring sunshine.  
  
**Narration:**   
But, even so...  
  
**Narration:**   
...I can still sense it clearly, Sigurd the hero.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...Yes. Of course I do.  
  
**Narration:**   
This power stored within me...  
  
**Narration:**   
...can reach explosive new heights thanks to its entanglements&ndash;its relationships&ndash;with those around me.  
  
**Brynhild:**   
We're waiting for you, Sigurd.  
  
**Sigurd:**   
...Right.  
Then I suppose we'd better get started.  
  
**Narration:**   
I start by taking a single step forward,  
as I answer their call.  
  
**Narration:**   
Formless and weightless though it may be, there is still energy to be found there&ndash;a kind with a name all its own.  
  
**Narration:**   
We call it...“love.”
