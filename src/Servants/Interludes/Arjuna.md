# Arjuna  
  
## True Value of the Divine Bow  
  
**Mash:**   
Wow...  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Well. This is about 10% of its original power.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
T-Ten percent?  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I accept you as my Master, Fujimaru. But that doesn't mean I pledge my loyalty to you.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
The most important thing in this world is trust. By fighting together, I was able to know you better.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
But, that is not enough. Therefore, I would like to test you, Master.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
It's simple. Just join me for three fights. During those fights, I will obey your every order.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
On the other hand, I won't do anything aside from obeying your orders. How well you utilize me as a weapon...  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
That's what I want to see. Is that all right?  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Oh, there's no problem if you want the other Servants to help as well.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I'm looking forward to it.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I know this is sudden, but enemies are approaching. As always, enemies this level are easy prey for us.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I seek a graceful, quick delivery of instructions from you, Master. That is all.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Arjuna:**   
Hmm, well done. Cutting off all thought and letting myself be controlled is not a bad feeling.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
However, don't get overconfident about beating those weaklings. The next enemies will be somewhat formidable.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
You must be able to defeat formidable opponents with ease. Otherwise, you're unfit to be a commander.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Don't worry. At least there's no fear of getting killed.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I, Arjuna, guarantee it.  
Well, let the fight begin.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Whew...  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Splendid! I acknowledge that there is no problem with Master's ability to command.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Now, this is the last test. Considering the type of enemies we may face in the future...  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I had a Servant prepared for this. No longer will you be fighting a mindless beast, but rather a true Hero recognized by the World itself.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
We must win. No matter how strong the enemy is, I must obtain a glorious victory.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...No, I guess WE must obtain a glorious victory. Come, let's fight.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I shall be a silent arrow! You just need to fire me toward the ones you recognize as your enemy.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
That's the ideal relationship of a Servant and a Master. Now, let's go!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Arjuna:**   
&ndash;Good. As expected, your talents as a Master are genuine. I trust you fully, and therefore pledge my allegiance to you.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
The name of my bow is Agni Gandiva. This divine bow granted by the God of Flame can shoot down anything.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I will show you its true strength in our upcoming battles.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Oh?  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
&ndash;Heh heh, this bow is ideal for you. Why don't I show you the true brilliance of its flame now!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Arjuna:**   
By the hellfire of Agni, God of Flame, be incinerated to ashes! ...No, this is not enough.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
O Shiva, God of Destruction... Rain down divine punishment upon my foes!  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...How was that, Master?  
No, you don't have to say anything.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
With this, my power has been proven. My weapon and Noble Phantasm are the most powerful of their kind.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
You can proudly declare that I'm the best Servant.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
U-Um...  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Yes?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The forest has been leveled.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Uh...uh...  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I think I was a little too enthusiastic...  
I am sorry.  
  
  
## By Continuing to Question  
  
**Arjuna:**   
...There you are, Karna.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Arjuna.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
No obstacles remain for me.  
Even if they did, I would destroy them all.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
This will be the end.  
I may be called a coward, but I will kill you.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I need to kill you!  
You know me, after all!  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...So this is karma. There is not room enough in the world for two supreme marksmen.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
My lance should be alone in its ability to scorch the land.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
There's no question of who dies here.  
The loser will become unnecessary.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Come at me, Arjuna. Lay it all on the line.  
Give it everything you have!  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Don't speak down to me!  
You asked for it!  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...Brilliant.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Haha...hahahaha! Hahahahaha!  
I win! My...my...my...!  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Is this truly victory?  
Or is this actually defeat?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I have no sense of satisfaction,  
no joy from this victory...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I don't even feel a sense of relief that the battle is over. The only thing that I have is this ceaseless feeling of emptiness.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I just killed the man who knew me best.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I have no regrets. My original sworn enemy...my oldest enemy. We were destined to fight each other. And yet...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
That man, who waded through battle after battle in blinding, golden armor...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...was the one and only hero who knew the ugly side of me.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Why, Karna?  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Why...why did you smile?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
And then my life came to an end while I yet pondered that mystery.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
As Arjuna, the Hero of the Endowed...I existed to protect the future.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
And then I was summoned as a Servant, and participated in many battles. I trust Master wholeheartedly.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
[♂ He /♀️ She} may be ordinary, and there are times when [♂ he /♀️ she} is too optimistic...yet still, [♂ he's /♀️ she's} a good Master.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Faithful. Accurate decision-making skills. And [♂ he /♀️ she} does not treat us Servants as mere familiars. [♂ He /♀️ She} treats us with respect, but is not distant.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Many Servants would consider [♂ him /♀️ her} the ideal Master.  
I number myself among them.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
That is why I unleashed the absolute limit of my Noble Phantasm's power. And yet...  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I have yet to show my true face to Master.  
No, I mustn't show it...  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
My blunt ugliness out in the open...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master. I have detected numerous enemies.  
It seems like a surprise attack.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Comfortable battles. A sense of fulfillment I feel knowing that I am fighting in the cause of absolute justice.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
The most wonderful cause of saving the world.  
Ah...I cannot stop laughing.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Arjuna?  
  
  
---  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...No, it's nothing.  
Now, let's go annihilate the enemy.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Enemy response, zero.  
No problems on our end. I recommend returning.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good work!  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master. Good work to you as well.  
I will have sesame buns ready for you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's get back, Arjuna.  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Yes, understood.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Arjuna:**   
By the way, Master, was there something on my face a few minutes ago?  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Nothing?  
I didn't look myself?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At least on my end, I did not see any fluctuations in his Spirit Origin value. Perhaps it's fatigue?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Arjuna, you've been volunteering for battle rather frequently recently.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And the other Servants, especially the battle-hungry ones, have been complaining that it's not fair.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...I may have overexerted myself.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Understood. I will be sure to leave the battles to the other Servants for a while.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Okay. Good work again!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah-ha, Senpai. I win in this round of cards.  
I will be taking this sesame bun as my prize.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But if you eat right before bed...  
   
**Mash:**   
...S-Servants don't gain weight.  
That applies to Demi-Servants, too!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Probably.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's all yours.  
   
**Mash:**   
Hehe. Don't sulk, Senpai.  
I have one for you, too.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Sweet dreams, Senpai...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Night!  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, good night.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Good night to you too, Fou.  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...?  
  
  
---  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...I defeated him.  
He's defeated.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Haha...hahahaha! Hahahahaha!  
I win! My...my...my...!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Arjuna...?  
  
  
---  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Master!?  
You...  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...saw my face, didn't you.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
You're finally awake, Master.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...I am surprised.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
You do not seem at all bewildered by the unexpected scene you just witnessed.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
It seems that we have fallen into a Servant's dream. It's likely that it's my dream, or that of someone who has some connection with me.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
If it's mine...then I apologize in advance.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm used to it. This happens a lot.  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Spoken like a true Master.  
But getting too used to this is hardly a good thing.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
You may one day be a prisoner of a different type of nightmare... Should you die inside a dream, your spirit will perish.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm in a dream again, aren't I?  
   
**Arjuna:**   
When you say “again,” do you mean you fall into the dreams of others often?  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
This is neither a Rayshift nor a case of teleportation.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
It's truly a curious phenomenon...  
But this is a first for me.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Anyway, we can do little if we remain in this darkness. We must analyze our surroundings.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Master, do not move. If we lose sight of each other, it will be difficult for us to find one another again.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...It's subtle, but I sense a breeze.  
Let's head in that direction.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
This place is like a labyrinth...and it's quite elaborate.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Not only that... No...one moment.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
This is not right.  
I do not understand.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong?  
  
  
---  
   
**Arjuna:**   
My only sense of this is, I admit, intuitive, but this labyrinth does not lead any higher than we are now.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
The only path leads lower...to the bottom.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So there's no exit?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Seems about right for a dungeon in a nightmare...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Yes, exactly. It's nonsensically structured, as only dreams can be.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Honestly.  
My apologies. This is most likely my own nightmare.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Were this your nightmare,  
it wouldn't have been as malicious as it is now.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
My nightmare... Eli's last supper. With live music.  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Is this Eli the mixed dragon Servant? Hahaha. A concert festival certainly sounds interesting.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Eh? A nightmare? Isn't it just music?  
What? I don't get the underlying issue?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
My nightmare would be Nightingale disinfecting me.  
   
**Arjuna:**   
That...is terrifying.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
My own mother, perhaps reflective of the times, spoiled me. Yet I still feel maternal love from Nightingale's fierceness.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Either way, isn't it nice to know the Servant is genuinely concerned for you?  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
A dream where she chases after you with a tank of disinfectant on her back? ...I see, that IS a nightmare...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Anyway, let's begin our descent.  
I have a feeling that that is our best option.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
It is annoying, though, to have so many creatures scuttling about... No, it shouldn't be an issue.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
We should have no trouble breaking through.  
Now then, let us cut them down.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Enemy response, zero.  
No problems on our end. I recommend returning.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good work!  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master. Good work to you as well.  
I will have sesame buns ready for you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's get back, Arjuna.

Yes, understood.

I have one for you, too.

**Mash:**   
Sweet dreams, Senpai...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Night!  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, good night.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Good night to you too, Fou.  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...?  
  
  
---  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...I defeated him.  
He's defeated.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Haha...hahahaha! Hahahahaha!  
I win! My...my...my...!

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Arjuna...?

**Arjuna:**

You...

**Arjuna:**   
We should have no trouble breaking through.  
Now then, let us cut them down.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Arjuna:**   
This is my answer: I am a Kshatriya,  
but I am a Servant&ndash;a familiar&ndash;at the same time.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I have a warrior's pride.  
I fulfill my duties as a familiar.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I can be both. I will not forsake my pride as a warrior, even as I swear my loyalty as a familiar.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
So you understand the theory. A sensible answer,  
as I would expect from the great Arjuna.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
But your response is acceptable only because this is a peaceful moment. I wonder whether you can give the same answer in a time of crisis.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Are you mocking me?  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Move on to your next trial, hero.  
Your destined enemy awaits!  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...I know. There's only one warrior in this world who radiates such fighting spirit.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
You've come, Arjuna.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Karna... Why are you here!?  
You shouldn't be in a place like this!  
  
   
**Karna:**   
My presence here suggests that you believe otherwise.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
An enemy who puts a question to Arjuna...  
That is my role here.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
I ask of you, my sworn enemy:  
Who are you?  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Krishna:**   
Ungh! Not yet!  
Give me your hand, Arjuna!  
  
   
**Krishna:**   
We must stand up together to fight against evil!  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...No. That's wrong.  
You're wrong, Krishna.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I know it's wrong.  
  
   
**Krishna:**   
Wh-what?  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I've been thinking about this the whole time.  
It's because of you that I was able to fire that arrow.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I blamed all my cowardice, everything I did that was unbecoming of a true warrior...on you.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...At that time, I just wanted relief.  
I thought the battle with Karna was going to last forever.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
The person I had been was being swallowed, and I despaired, knowing I was moving away from the path of a warrior.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
But I must accept it. No matter how much I wish to resist, the one who fired that arrow was...  
  
   
**Krishna:**   
Don't say it, Arjuna! If you say it,  
you will be cursed for thousands of years!  
  
   
**Karna:**   
You must say it, Arjuna.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
There is no correct answer. The only thing you can do is hold on to your conviction until the very end.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
There will be times when you will feel lost.  
That is why we must walk the path with Master.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
A Servant needs to live their second life carrying their doubts with them.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
After all, you have never before reached this place where you now stand, not even in life.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...I was the one who fired the arrow.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I held that arrow, I fit the arrow to the bow,  
and let it loose. It was me, Arjuna.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I'm sorry.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Krishna. At that decisive moment,  
you were not on the chariot with me.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
That's right.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Krishna was fighting elsewhere. But after he learned of how much humiliation you suffered, he kept quiet.  
  
   
**Krishna:**   
...You are going to be admitting your own evil. Whether you be alive, dead, or even a Heroic Spirit, you cannot ever take that back.  
  
   
**Krishna:**   
You will bear this regret for eternity.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
That may be true.  
But I have decided I will no longer fear regret.  
  
   
**Krishna:**   
...  
  
   
**Krishna:**   
I see...Then I shall hold on to that regret of yours.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Krishna?  
  
   
**Krishna:**   
Maybe...just maybe...my existence is the leak in the dam.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I don't understand what you're getting at.  
  
   
**Krishna:**   
Nothing. I'm just talking to myself. Don't worry about it. It's time to wake up, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Krishna:**   
It's unlikely I will make another appearance anytime soon. You should forget about this whole dream.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
I will not be appearing here again.  
Farewell Arjuna. Farewell Master.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I will fade away too.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
But I must apologize, Master. The numerous times you were put in danger...all of it was because of me.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
It is probably because the bond between you and I has grown stronger.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
The deeper the bond I form with someone, the more fearful I become of them learning of the existence of my Krishna.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
That's why I called you to my dream,  
and tried to kill you.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I'm such a fool... A vile, detestable betrayer.  
I would not protest should I be put to death.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Master.  
Now you know all of who...of what I am.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
And yet, you still embrace my everything...my light, my darkness, and my evil.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I see... Then I will never again fear that smile of yours, nor this darkness. Never again...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This...isn't a dream, is it?  
  
  
---  
   
**Arjuna:**   
You have awoken, Master.  
I thank you for showing me such a wonderful dream.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
And I would also like to apologize for putting your life in danger.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
But I am in something of a bind. The crime that I committed should cost me my life, but if I do offer up my life, I would not be able to fight for you anymore.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Whatever should I do?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Morning, Arjuna.  
  
  
---  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Good morning.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I will waver no more.  
I will dedicate all that I have to serving you.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
But now that I think about it...  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I felt like I was on a long, long journey...  
Yet it seemed a short thing at the same time.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
There is nothing absolute in this world.  
Various substances prowl, wander, and are transient.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Emotions are no exception.  
Even love can one day change to hate and sadness.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Or the opposite might happen.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
But there is just one thing that I can say with confidence.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...I feel fortunate to have met you.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I am an Archer. My True Name is Arjuna.  
I am a Kshatriya warrior and a Servant...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I lend my strength to a Master in order to win back the future. I am just an average Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I am a descendant of a god, but not a god myself. I may have incredible power that ordinary humans lack, but I am still human.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I simply fight. I fight for my Master.  
My reason for fighting is my belief in my Master.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
That is all I require to see myself as a hero. For that purpose, I can embrace the darkness within me and not be abashed by it.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I am an Archer.  
I am Arjuna.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I am Fujimaru's Servant.
