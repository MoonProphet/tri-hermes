**Mash:**   
Master, Hektor would like to ask something.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Hey Master, you there?  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
You don't have to be so on edge.  
I'm your Servant now.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm not on edge.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm not worried.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Hektor:**   
I see. Good. So anyway,  
there's something I wanted to talk to you about.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Mind if I ask you too, Mash?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
N-Not at all. Go ahead...  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Okay, well I'll get straight to the point.  
I'm not using all of my power right now.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Going easy?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're strong if you tried?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Hektor:**   
Right. Of course, I'm not trying to go easy or anything,  
and I could be powerful if I tried, you know?  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
But my Noble Phantasm...  
It's gotten a bit weaker.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Durandal, right? I think you called it...  
Durindana, was it?  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Yeah, that's the name, I think.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wouldn't it be better for you to remember its True Name?  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Well... Ha, ha, ha. To be honest, I don't really care what lance I have as long as I can throw it.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
It's natural for great swords and lances to break left and right on the battlefield.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
And even if it didn't break, it's lost once you throw it.  
So you learn to make do with whatever you've got.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
To be honest, this old man can even kill someone with a single stone. Whether they're a Heroic Spirit or not.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Well, in any event. This lance is legendary in later generations.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
I need to get it sharpened again, ya'know. Let me see.  
As long as I can cut down 100 more people with it&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Then how about you do some training in a programmed simulation?  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
A virtual battle, huh?  
I guess I can't be picky.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Master, what do you think?  
Want to help this old man with some training?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Guess I have to.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Not a problem.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Hektor:**   
Good. Quick answers like that show one's true nature.  
You're a great Master after all.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
All right. Let's go.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Okay, we're here.  
So about those enemies&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
How about we get started with the humanoid ones first?  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Okay, we'll use that for warm-up, then.  
All right Master&ndash;give me your orders!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Hektor:**   
I'm starting to get the hang of this.  
Let's kick it up a notch.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Master, add fifty more!  
Raise the level just a little, too!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
G-Got it.  
I'll summon some ghost-type enemies next.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
All right. You can't kill fog by piercing or cutting it&ndash;  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
You must scatter it,  
like a raging storm!  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Give me your orders, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Hektor:**   
Whew.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Confirming the elimination of all ghosts.  
The next set will be the last.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
If we're on the last set,  
then bring me a really strong one next.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
If you want, I can even take on a dragon.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In that case&ndash;I'll summon a dragon-type enemy for you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you serious!?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're joking, right!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? That was a joke?  
I already started the summoning process!  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
It'll be fine. No problem.  
My duty is to protect my Master.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
You know this old man, when it comes to holding the line, guard duty, defense&ndash;  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Basically, anything involving protecting something or someone... I've never lost before.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
The Achilles thing was different!  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Now Master, give me your orders!  
As your shield and fortress&ndash;I pledge to fight, yeah?  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
I've confirmed its defeat!  
That was impressive, Hektor.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Yeah, yeah. This old man pushed himself a bit too hard.  
My shoulders and back hurt all over.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
I think Durindana's got its sharpness back a little.  
Guess I'll call it good for now.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Anyway, let's head back. &ndash;Oh, yeah.  
I guess I can be a bit more useful from now on?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Please continue to lend us your strength.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Hektor:**   
I see.  
Then I'll do the best I can.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm not sure if this is the case,  
but maybe that ocean battle was on Hektor's mind?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
To him it might be the distant past,  
but to us it's like yesterday.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So maybe he's trying to show he can be a good Servant...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I trust him.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...I suppose you're right. That's what a Servant is, after all.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He is the one who answered our summons, so I'm sure that's a happy thing and not a troubling matter.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's continue to have him fight by our side.
