## Geronimo In London  
  
**Geronimo:**   
Hm. A paved road.  
A faint foul odor.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
No grass or earth. An ominous place covered with cold stones. I suppose even the fog that's been dirtied by science conceals magecraft.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
So this is 19th century London.  
Truly distasteful. But not bad, either.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hm, Geronimo?  
Which is it?  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
I'm just saying it's not bad.  
By the way, Master, sorry to trouble you.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
I'm sorry I was so selfish in asking you to come here.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't mind. But why?  
  
  
---  
   
**Geronimo:**   
It's the home of modern magecraft, correct?  
I never had a chance to cross the sea in my lifetime.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Our magecraft and their magecraft split apart completely in history.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
On the other hand, there are many similarities as well. And let us set aside discussion of which is the original for the time being.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
I've always wanted to take a look.  
Now, are there any rituals worthy of study...?  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Hm. But first, spirits.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
We often borrow the powers of spirits...but this is a low-class one.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
It never occurred to me that we would encounter such a spirit the instant we set foot here, though.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
I see London and death are quite...intimate in this time.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
U-um, if you would kindly help us fight...  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Fight? There is no reason not to just ignore something so weak...  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Weak. Fragile. Fleeting.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
It doesn't possess the strong emotions,  
grudges, or regrets normally so important to ghosts.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
It likely died in a freak accident and something tied it to this place.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
And then I expect it was awoken by the demonic fog that blanketed the city.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Besides, take a look at that insubstantial figure.  
It is practically advertising its weakness.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Honestly, it's not worth involving ourselves.  
It may be a ghost, but it is hardly important.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Professor Geronimo?  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Oh. I see, I see. My apologies.  
I may have provoked them a bit.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
They've all combined themselves to attack us.  
They must really be angry.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're right. They're pretty angry.  
To say it as Blackbeard might, they're triggered!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You did that on purpose.  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Well, yes. I suppose.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
To be honest, it'd be disingenuous of me to say I wasn't hoping for something like this.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
I wanted to see what an English ghost would do if they got serious.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Either way, my apologies. I'd like you to accompany me in some, shall we say, ghost busting.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood.  
Master, your command, please!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Geronimo:**   
I see, I see. There are exponentially more spirits here than in the land where I lived.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
...And I wonder what else is here?  
Let's keep looking around.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Wow, Geronimo seems like he's having a good time. Is he the sort who's taken in by new and different things?)  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Ah. This bounded field technique is impressive! It's so intricately constructed, appropriate for a small island nation like this.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
It's like a fine Persian rug...such wonderful detail.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
The fields that we created were quite crude.  
However, even if one is intricately constructed...  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Ah, yes. Unfortunately, the mage who constructed this seems to have been somewhat lacking in terms of power.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
If this is the best they could do, my field would still have been better.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wh-what are you doing!?  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Someone erected a field here, so I destroyed it.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Now then.  
Who or what will show up...  
  
   
**Mage:**   
Wh-who are you!? This is my territory! You just destroyed the concealment rite I worked so hard on!  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
We are merely travelers. I see no sense in you putting a bounded field in a place like this.  
  
   
**Mage:**   
Wh-who the hell are you!?  
You're a foreigner!  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
In addition to that, I am not human. At least not anymore. Either way, you are also a budding mage.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Am I correct in pointing out that you have already abandoned being human as well?  
  
   
**Mage:**   
Answer MY question!  
Who the hell are you!?  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
By the way, would you mind telling me why it is you put a field here?  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Hm, for example...  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Was your intention to conduct a sacrificial ritual using those children standing behind you?  
  
   
**Mage:**   
...!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sacrifices!?  
  
   
**Mage:**   
Hnh, unfortunate... I didn't want to involve tourists, but I cannot let you leave alive now.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Oh, on the contrary.  
This will have been your ill fortune.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Had it been some other mage, they might have tried to steal the fruits of your efforts, but not likely impeded your progress.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Or rather, if this was truly your territory,  
they might have avoided this area all together.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Wherever you may go, most people prefer to avoid conflict with people with whom they have no connection.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
However, unfortunately for you, the ones who happened by were myself and my Master.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
I am afraid we are not good enough mages to allow such egregious behavior to go ignored.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
That, in turn, means that you have no opportunity to explain yourself or negotiate.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
You must die right here.  
  
   
**Mage:**   
The hell I will!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He transformed!?  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
I see, I see. How fitting in a city like London.  
He's a werewolf.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
However, this is merely a superficial transformation using newer magecraft techniques.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
His kind is nothing compared to the Phantasmals who are said to have lived since the Age of Gods.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
The coyote from my nation would be a better adversary. Well, if he intends to fight, I have no choice.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Let's muzzle this beast, shall we? Here, boy.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Geronimo:**   
And that's that.  
  
   
**Mage:**   
Gargh... Im...possible...I worked...so hard...  
  
   
**Mage:**   
My clan's oldest wish... The recreation of a Divine Beast... To be hindered...at the first step...  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
I warned you. The structure of your rite was composed poorly. Now, let's release the children.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
No...they would be terrified by the sight of me.  
I believe you are best fit for the job. If you would, Master. I leave it to you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mage:**   
Why...you...!  
Then I have no choice but to offer my own life...!  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
A summoning circle!  
Take care, Master! Something's coming forth!  
  
   
**Mage:**   
Devour my own life and answer my call!  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
I see.  
This is due to the disorder in the ages.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Even in a modern time like this one, the instability in the world is enough to allow for the summoning of ancient beasts!  
  
   
**Mage:**   
I am...not a fool...! I am the smartest in my village...a genius bursting with knowledge...!  
  
   
**Mage:**   
And this is proof!  
Now my clan's wishes will be fulfilled!  
  
   
**Mage:**   
No...I was trying to...call forth...something more divine...!  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Fool. An attempt to summon a Divine Beast in a London where the foundations of humanity are so unstable is doomed to failure!  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
The only possible result would be monsters drenched in blood, full of rage...  
  
   
**Mage:**   
How embarrassing... I want to go back to my village... You...mage...I have a favor to ask...  
  
   
**Mage:**   
Please...get rid of...that...  
We never meant...to plunge the world...into chaos...  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
I have no arguments there.  
You just rest in peace now.  
  
   
**Mage:**   
...  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Hmph. What a selfish mage. But now that he summoned that thing, we need to deal with it.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
It certainly doesn't appear that we'll be able to reason with it and convince it to return whence it came. That being the case, Master...  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
We shall shine the dazzling brightness of the sun into London's night and incinerate all that is evil.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
I'm going to use my Noble Phantasm!  
Master, I'm leaving the moment to unleash it up to you!  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Let's go!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Geronimo:**   
It's finally over.  
I was sadly unable to complete my tour of London.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
We should lightly hypnotize the children and send them home with no memory of this.  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
We wouldn't want them to draw a mage's attention by mentioning anything strange, would we?  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
The bigger issue is...  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Whenever I hypnotize someone,  
I must use cigarettes to do so...  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
But you say that underage children mustn't smoke, yes?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Definitely not.  
  
  
---  
   
**Geronimo:**   
That is quite the conundrum.  
I suppose I should consult with Miss Da Vinci on this.
