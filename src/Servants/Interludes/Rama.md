# Rama  
  
## Vishnu's Test  
  
**Rama:**   
U-ungh...  
  
   
**???:**  
Rama...Rama...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Uh...ungh...  
Who calls me?  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
It is I, Vishnu.  
Rama, awaken...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Oh, crap, Vishnu!?  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
“Crap”?  
  
   
**Rama:**   
M-my sincerest apologies...!  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
Rama. How has everything been going since Fujimaru summoned you?  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
Is there anything you feel is missing,  
or do you have any immediate concerns?  
  
   
**Rama:**   
No, Master is always kind to me.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Master treats me not as a king,  
not as [♂ his /♀️ her] retainer, but as a friend.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
I have not had any complaints since I have been summoned.  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
...I see. That was a quick response.  
How about during battle?  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Hahaha. I'm all good on the fighting front!  
I would love to show you my power, Vishnu!  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
Oh, really? Is that so? That's some big talk.  
I never took you for the type to talk that way.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Eh?  
V-Vishnu...?  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
Rama...  
Oh, Rama...  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
Think back, Rama. Back to when you manifested as a Servant, to when you were given your Noble Phantasm...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Eh? Are you talking about another, different Noble Phantasm than my Brahmastra...?  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Vishnu Baazoo, the Arm of the Great One...oh!  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
Rama...  
Oh, Rama...  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
You! Have! Forgotten! The Noble Phantasm!  
With! My! Name! You! Forgot! You can't use it!!!  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Gyaaaaaahhh!!!  
I-I-I-I'm terribly sorry, great Vishnu!  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
Well, that won't do, will it?  
What's the deal, Rama?  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
Did you really not realize until I just reminded you that your Noble Phantasm was sealed!? What have you got between your ears!? Marshmallows!?  
  
   
**Rama:**   
A-absolutely not! I d-didn't forget It's just... W-well, um, I've never encountered any enemies strong enough to require using your power...  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
Oh-ho. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, knowing your power. But then, I suppose you must not have any use for this Noble Phantasm, either.  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
Even without your Brahmastra, you'll be fine.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
But...!  
P-please do not go, great Vishnu!  
  
   
**Rama:**   
I...I was mistaken!  
Please, at least leave me my Brahmastra!  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
...Very well. If you're that desperate,  
I shall give you a chance.  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
However, understand that to succeed, you must repeatedly shout my favorite word.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Y-yes! Certainly and swiftly!  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
Very well. That is the lifestyle that you must always be mindful of. They say that swiftness and decisiveness are most important to a soldier.  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
Now, then. I have somewhere for you to travel with your Master. There, you will find the trial I have set for you.  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
Know this: should you fail in this trial...you will no longer receive my blessing.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
You can count on me!  
  
   
**Vishnu:**   
You must always mind me, and never again forget me... Use your Noble Phantasm properly (...erly...erly...)  
  
   
**Rama:**   
...And that was my dream.  
Please, Master, you gotta help me! Mash, you too!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Well, in that case...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do gods really act like that?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Th-that sounds suspicious...  
  
---  
  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Hm. Well, actually... The being I spoke to was both the great Vishnu, and not Vishnu at the same time.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
It's the Vishnu that I envision, since I've never really MET them personally!  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Besides, the great Vishnu who appears in my dreams doesn't seem to have a fully formed personality and is maybe a bit wacky.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
But this much I'm certain of: I receive a message from the great Vishnu whenever I lose my way or forget something.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
It could be my subconscious trying to make me realize that I had unknowingly blinded myself to something...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Or perhaps the real great Vishnu is truly sending me a message... I'm honestly not sure.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So, you have no clue.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Pretty much!  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Regardless, I'm sure there is some truth to the notion that something is about to happen to me!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
True...there may be some truth in Rama's dream.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, what do you mean?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A few hours ago, a minute Singularity formed, and we detected it in America, on the island of Alcatraz.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Alcatraz, huh?  
  
   
**Rama:**   
That's where Sita was...  
That place must have something to do with my dream.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
With the Sixth and Seventh Singularities remaining, leaving it alone could endanger humanity.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's take care of it. Swiftly.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Roger that, Doctor.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Obviously, you'll take me with you, right?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course!  
  
---  
  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Ah, my friend!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What is it, Fou?  
You're saying it's a friendship of self-interest?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That can't be true, Fou.  
Right, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I hope not.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Friendship must be true.  
  
---  
  
  
   
**Rama:**   
A-anyway, let's get a move on, quickly!  
Our trial awaits...probably!  
  
   
**Rama:**   
A trial, huh? Now that I reflect back,  
it seems like my life was full of them.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
According to the Ramayana, Rama was first exiled from his homeland when he was a prince.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Indeed.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
My stepmother Kaikeyi suspected that I would treat her unfairly if I became king.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Most conspiracies have their genesis in tiny doubts.  
I count myself lucky that I wasn't killed, at least.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Luckily, my younger brother Lakshmana also came with me. It felt like I was heading out on a long journey rather than getting exiled.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
And above all, since I had Sita with me, my exile wasn't so bad.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And if I remember correctly, Bharata, who was supposed to be king, refused to ascend the throne, and waited for you.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Yes. I was fortunate in all respects. I must admit that the fun was confined to the beginning of my journey, though.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Everything went downhill after Sita was taken.  
Hey, Master...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
You fight all your battles to restore humanity. I have no hesitation offering my life for that purpose.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
However, had I been summoned for a proper Holy Grail War, I may have wished for the following:  
  
   
**Rama:**   
To change the past.  
To undo the past where Sita was taken from me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Rama...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's true that a normal Holy Grail War might be able to grant that wish.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But it could create various distortions. For example, Sita may not have been taken, but the curse may still be there...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Or perhaps, in consequence of your group being saved, your homeland may have met a different fate.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
...Distortion, huh? I suppose that's what happens when things are changed.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
In any case, that's all hypothetical.  
Let's concentrate on the matter at hand.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We've arrived at the coast.  
This was where we headed to Alcatraz by boat.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It feels so long ago.  
I wonder if the old man we met back then is well.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
I hear he is in good health. But I had him evacuate, because this place is about to become a battlefield.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!  
  
   
**Rama:**   
A hero sent to test me!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Indeed.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
I am King Rama of Kosala!  
Hero that I must overcome, please show yourself!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Understood.  
I did have every intention of doing so eventually...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It can't be... Karna?!  
  
   
**Karna:**   
I am your first trial. I shall demonstrate a piercing stare...  
I mean, the proper bearing of a hero.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
A real hero kills with his eyes.  
King of Kosala, receive my Brahmastra!  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Got it. If you're my first opponent, then I have no complaints!  
  
   
**Rama:**   
I will push my power to its limit!  
Let's do this, Master!!!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Karna:**   
...Splendid. This is the end.  
I have seen enough of your indestructible blade.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
I wish I could emulate the valiant, and yet disarmingly honest moves that you retain as a result of being summoned as an inexperienced hero.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Move on to the second trial, but proceed with caution.  
It may not be as easy as this one.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Thank you, Lord Karna. It was an honor to cross blades with a famed hero like you.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Compared to the hero awaiting you at the second trial,  
I was but a trifling opponent. Go, board the boat.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
A hero that Karna thinks makes him seem insignificant...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Do you think he's being humble?  
Karna is quite modest...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
I hope that's all it is. These are, after all,  
heroes gathered specifically for this trial...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Which means the next hero is...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, watch out!  
  
   
**Rama:**   
An arrow!  
So, we're looking for an Archer!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
You are correct. I am the gatekeeper for this second trial...  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Rest assured, I will not allow my personal feelings to interfere with this trial.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
No matter what happened in the past, even if I was on your side...please do not think too much of it.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Now we're up against Arjuna...!  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Now, show me this indestructible blade of yours.  
I will judge whether you are worthy of wielding it!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Arjuna:**   
...Well, it seems you pass.  
Something is still missing, but that's hardly a surprise.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Of course, any Heroic Spirit would find himself lacking when standing in comparison to me.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Don't you agree?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well you're not...not entirely...not incorrect...?  
  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Puzzling...which is it!?  
Do you believe it's true, or not?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nope.  
  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Really.  
Then shall we battle once more?  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Waitwaitwait!  
I'll have you declare that I've overcome my trial!  
  
   
---  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Ah. That may have been somewhat childish of me.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Rama. You are quite perplexing.  
You overcame so many trials in your lifetime.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
And, in doing so, you became a full and complete hero.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Had you not been summoned as your youthful self,  
these trials now would be unnecessary.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
You may be right.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
It's possible that I could be summoned as an older king, one who would remember Sita, but had also come to terms with what happened to her.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Had that version of me been more compatible with Master, it might have been summoned...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
But it appears that this form was best suited to my Master.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
And knowing that makes me happy.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Hm. How heartwarming.  
I mean...ahem.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
That is precisely why one must grow stronger.  
Even Servants.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
That is the purpose of this trial.  
Grow stronger, Lord Rama.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
...Okay.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I shall bid you farewell.  
The final hero awaits you.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...He will be your greatest challenge of all.  
He is not one to hold back.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
A hero who doesn't hold back...  
I wonder who could that be?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It should be all right. Karna and Arjuna were both great and famous heroes.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And you defeated both of them, Rama.  
You should have more confidence as you go forward.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
...Yeah, you're right.  
Okay, I'm ready for anyone!  
  
   
**Rama:**   
No matter who the opponent, I'll squash them!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
...Oh? What's this?  
It seems a yammering mongrel approaches.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Wha...!?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Nothing to be surprised about.  
You summoned me here.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I am Gilgamesh, King of Heroes,  
and I crush you underfoot.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Battle with Sabers&ndash;any Saber&ndash;never fails to excite me.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Ugh...Gilgamesh!!!  
They always save the greatest challenge for last...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fuhahaha! Do you think this trial is just about going up against a tough opponent!? Wrong!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
The true trial isn't just a matter of defeating me. As if a mongrel like you could ever defeat the likes of me!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Nice to see he's still completely full of himself...)  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
One who still needs to prove his strength through battle will be of no use in the Restoration of Humanity.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
So show yourself!  
  
   
**Sita:**   
Rama...  
Lord Rama, is that you?  
  
   
**Rama:**   
...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
That voice...  
It can't be. Sita!?  
  
   
**Sita:**   
Yes, it is I.  
  
   
**Sita:**   
It seems the great Vishnu arranged for me to be summoned on this land once again.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
I'm so glad...!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hahahaha. Excited, are you not, King of Kosala?  
Why do you think your wife is on my side?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's a hostage...?  
  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fool! What use would I, who is sure to be the victor here, have for a hostage!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She's our enemy...?  
  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Exactly.  
Your final trial is a trial of love.  
  
   
---  
  
   
**Sita:**   
Lord Rama...  
The great Vishnu has lifted our curse.  
  
   
**Sita:**   
We can be together now...forever.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
What...!?  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Th-that is most generous of Vishnu...  
I'm grateful, sincerely...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
But Sita, why are you on his side?  
  
   
**Sita:**   
The great Vishnu was kind enough not only to lift our curse, but also to grant my wish...  
  
   
**Sita:**   
I wished that my Lord Rama would never be hurt...would be spared these endless battles.  
  
   
**Sita:**   
Please, join us, Lord Rama.  
Leave the Restoration of Humanity to the others.  
  
   
**Sita:**   
If there are as many heroes as stars in the sky, what is one fewer? We should be able to have our peace, to have our happiness...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Are you saying, that I can be with you as long as I break my contract with Master?  
  
   
**Sita:**   
Yes, it is I.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Then I know that you are a fake.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
I could never deserve such a reward without overcoming my trials.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Oh?  
  
   
**Sita:**   
If you're calling me a fake,  
then the same must be true of you...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
This is not about being a Servant or Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
First of all, you're not even a Servant.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
...Yeah, I know... I understand, and I know this is an offer I must refuse.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
But...well...you know...Master...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I get it.  
  
---  
  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you all right?  
  
---  
  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Rejecting loved ones is so hard.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
How, in my past life...even if it was to avoid unnecessary bloodshed...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
How did I manage to go through with this?  
  
   
**Sita:**   
...I see. So you mean to reject me.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
(Even though his rank as a Heroic Spirit is far beneath mine, he does not waver in his beliefs. Impertinent mongrel.)  
  
   
**Rama:**   
I can't do it, Sita.  
That is the one thing I cannot do.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
To break my contract with Master would mean doing the same thing I did to you, Sita.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
I know I'm not supposed to let go this time.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Heh. What will you do, queen?  
You heard what your husband said.  
  
   
**Sita:**   
If he rejects my love, then the only thing left to do is to devour him...! That's my only option!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...What?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, does it look like Gilgamesh is also surprised?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fuhahahaha! Why, humanity's on the brink of collapse. This sort of strangeness is to be expected.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Now, small king of a smaller nation. It is time for you to face your final trial: this monster...and me!  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Yeah, let's do this!  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Brahmastra!  
Shine...like you did back then!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
...Hmph.  
Battle's over.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
You may be bleeding from a hundred wounds,  
but your trial is over.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
(Pant...pant...pant...)  
  
   
**Sita:**   
Rama...  
My dear Rama...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
...Next time...we meet...I'll go...see you...I'll be sure to walk tall and proud...  
  
   
**Sita:**   
...Okay...  
  
   
**Sita:**   
If you tell the real Sita...she'll likely...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Sheesh. I heard somewhere that even Lancers (better known as dogs) prefer to stay out of lovers' spats.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Lancers...?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
You had to be there.  
Anyway, this is the end of your trial.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Young king of a small nation, it's all right to agonize over this kind of thing, but not in public. Understand?  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Trials...  
  
   
**Rama:**   
This might have been for the best.  
This body and psyche of mine are both still immature.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
A fake Sita agitating me so much proves that.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
But hear me out, Master: I will show you my strength in overcoming adversity.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
And if that helps me grow stronger to protect you and Sita...that just means I'm going in the right direction.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Now, Master, our journey to restore humanity continues.  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Let's go!
