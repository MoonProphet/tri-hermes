# Tristan  
  
## It Begins with Loss  
  
**Narration:**   
These are the things I let go of...the things I lost.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I reach out, but the distance is infinite,  
which only compounds my melancholy.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
And so I surrender, I stop my vain efforts,  
and return to my own tasks.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Ah...that is probably the beginning of my mistakes.  
This hand is, truly...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is that a harp...?  
It must be Tristan.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Somehow sounds even more sad than usual.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's playing something different, isn't he?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The music that he usually plays combines both cold vibrations and warm rhythms. But this...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can sense a heavy sadness, like someone is lost at the bottom of the sea all alone...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Oh? It appears Sir Tristan is thinking of something sad.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Bedivere...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Something sad?  
  
  
---  
   
**Bedivere:**   
The music that the knight plays usually reflects his present mood.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
If he's happy, he plays a happy tune. When he's sad, a sad song. He can express even the most complex of emotions with his harp.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Aww, Bird Boy is sad again?  
That's a switch.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mordred!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Mordred, do you have any idea why Sir Tristan is so melancholy today?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
'Course not.  
...Ehh...maaaybe...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
If that dork, a guy so dense he could sleep through a parade, is sad...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
It's gotta be because of our king or some girl.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Either one of those'll set him off real fast.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
That's true...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He slept through a parade?  
  
  
---  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Yes...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
After a victorious expedition,  
we returned home in triumph with our king.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
We received a joyous reception from the citizenry.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
But...while we were riding through the fanfare...  
Sir Tristan was asleep on his horse.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Sir Lancelot obvious reprimanded him, but he may even have been sleeping through the lecture.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Eh, looking at that guy you can't hardly tell if he's asleep or awake anyway!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Unless something is REALLY serious, he's always got his eyes closed. Somehow he's still aware of his surroundings, though.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I read somewhere that animals like bats and whales possess an ability called echolocation.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Perhaps Sir Tristan is like that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That is...certainly a theory.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Well then, he's got to be a bat! We're already not sure whether he's a bird or a human anyway!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Well, that is quite rude, Sir Mordred.  
But Sir Tristan's nerves are truly mystifying.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
He possesses sensitivity, impudence,  
transience, and incorrigibility...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
An animal that is tranquil, unreadable, but is said to shed tears at times...indeed, I suppose comparing him to a whale is appropriate.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...Sir Bedivere.  
Sir Mordred.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Ack!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, Tristan.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I have come, Master.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I've heard my name bandied about with some unkind words.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's those two.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Something about a bat or whale...  
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
That is...hmmm. A bat is out of the question because they are lacking in eloquence, but I suppose a whale isn't so bad.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Eh? Seriously!?  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
See what I mean?  
That's what this whale-man is like.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
What the heck!? Bats fly and they suck blood! They are SO much cooler than whales! They're freakin' badass!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...Ah, I am suddenly stricken with sadness.  
So, a bad man is what you see as beautiful...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
As knights, I believe we must change that perspective. The same goes for the heartless Sir Bedivere.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Haha...my fingers are itching to play music.  
It's been a while, but shall I play some battle songs?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Um...it's time for my training!  
See ya!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
And I remembered I need to return the books I borrowed from the library. I'm thrice overdue, so I must be sure to return them today!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...(Sigh)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Tristan, are you mad?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
No, not at all.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
It's hardly news that Mordred is so...lively,  
nor that Bedivere is so strict with me.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
But I am not known as Tristan,  
the Child of Sadness for nothing.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
The sadness that I bear in my heart does not simply disappear so easily.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
So during our next battle simulation, I shall stand against him and focus my attention on my target!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(He's so angry!)  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Though I have to admit...I am at least a little angry after hearing that conversation.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
(Sigh)... Sir Bedivere really knows how to push my buttons...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
By the way, that harp...  
   
**Tristan:**   
Ah, I see you've noticed.  
...I was remembering the past.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Did something sad happen?  
   
**Tristan:**   
How direct of you. Yes...I was remembering something very sad from very long ago.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
I was thinking of Iseult.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Isn't Iseult your...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
There were, in fact, two Iseults in my lifetime.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
One was the Iseult I loved.  
The other was the Iseult with white hands who loved me.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...Most people get the wrong idea about this story if I tell it.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
They think of it as a story of an immoral two-timer, figuring that makes sense for a handsome man like me.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well...  
   
**Tristan:**   
It's fine.  
No need to sugarcoat your words.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Didn't you love them both?  
   
**Tristan:**   
Yes.  
And that is the problem.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
Ultimately, did I really love someone?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Eh...!?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
According to legend, my falling in love was the work of a love potion.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
That mad, passionate feeling...I never once felt it with the Iseult with the white hands.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
But that was just the effects of the potion. Could it have been a mistake...a fleeting dream one night?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Yes. And all this seems to come from the fact that I was never loved once, not from the moment I was born.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
As I never knew love during my childhood,  
perhaps I never learned to love others.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Thinking on such things immediately drags me down, and the next thing I knew, I was playing this music.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, I don't think that is true.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Tristan, you're the sort who would never think twice about sacrificing his life for others.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Ah, that is simply how a knight should be.  
  
   
But...ah, however...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
As Sir Bedivere mentioned,  
maybe I do fail as a human being?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
As a melancholy dragon who never knew love, I can't help but to think I may well end up crushed under Martha's foot!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
STOP!  
   
**Tristan:**   
But I'm not moving.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Calm down!!!  
   
**Tristan:**   
I am calm.  
My heart is beating at a normal rate.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I can check my pulse if you would like.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gawain:**   
Haha, Tristan's up to his old tricks. Once he gets started on a self-loathing rant, there's really no stopping him. He'll be at this for a while.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Gawain!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Sir Gawain...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
But...I'm sure even you would not understand my suffering.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Of course I wouldn't understand. Not so much your sadness as WHY you are always getting so sad.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Nobody can best you when it comes to loving someone...at least that's what I think.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Love is a shapeless thing to begin with.  
Even loyalty is a type of love, wouldn't you agree?  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
It has nothing to do with physical lust.  
The intensity of passion is also meaningless.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
For example, let's say that there is a man who was weak and mild-mannered. He then took a woman to be his wife...  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
But then, a powerful entity threatened his life, unless he would trade it for his wife. And the man, sadly, complied.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Would you say that he did not love his wife?  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Who are we, who are much better able to fight such a being, to say that such a man did not love his wife?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Well...  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Love is not just about not wanting to let go.  
It's not that you don't know love...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I...  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
...My apologies. I may have overstepped my bounds...  
I got too aggressive, just as I do in battle.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Master. Please do not trouble yourself about Tristan's lamentations.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
This cloud of sadness can simply be blown away by force. Working up a sweat in the simulator should distract him.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're right.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Care to try, Tristan?  
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
...I suppose.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
It feels a touch impulsive and perhaps even brutish, but I suppose I should try Sir Gawain's idea.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Very well, then, Master, please give me your orders.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
In my present wavering state, it's best if I ask you to make the decisions here.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Then use a simulation of me for his opponent.  
Please make him as strong as possible.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
After all, the intention here is to distract Sir Tristan from his perpetual melancholy.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
His opponent should be a knight with all the force and power of the sun!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A full-power Gawain!?  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm having trauma flashbacks, too, Senpai!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
For Tristan's sake, let's give him all our support!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Good luck Tristan!  
   
**Tristan:**   
Yes, I am well aware of how terrifying a full-powered Sir Gawain can be.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I shall set aside my inner anguish for now and concentrate on fighting!  
  
   
  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Good work, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...He was strong.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
What a brute. So much so that I nearly lost the melody that has been in my head this whole time.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Fortunately, that let me concentrate on the battle.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Still, I can hardly believe the pain that even a Servant can feel!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
No wonder others call this a second life.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't get too hung up on it.  
   
**Tristan:**   
I will try.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I cannot forget that if I become a burden to my Master,  
I am a failure as a knight.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I shall set my sadness aside.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If you want to talk...  
   
**Tristan:**   
Yes, I know I can come to you, Master.  
I have no intention of keeping secrets from you.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
My song has a certain bounce to it now.  
It seems tonight I will be playing a pleasant tune.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Good night, Master.  
May we both have pleasant dreams.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...I dreamt I became a bird and flew through the air.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I've always felt that dreams of this sort are philosophical in a way.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Something about seeking freedom.  
Or something like a bird is dreaming about you.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But that is not possible.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
My name is Tristan. A Knight of the Round Table...  
No, I am a Heroic Spirit. A Servant. An Archer.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I open my eyes with conviction.  
I know Master is before me.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Master does not look bewildered.  
[♂ He /♀️ She} looks straight at me.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
[♂ He /♀️ She} is not strict like my king,  
but also not gentle like a saint.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I was captivated by those intensely human eyes.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Master, am I dreaming?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
In response, [♂ he /♀️ she} nodded.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I see.  
So we're in my dream.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's how this usually goes, yeah...  
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
I see.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
In brief, this is more the inside of a Servant's mental world than it is a dream.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I had no idea that you fought for any purpose other than restoring humanity, whether in or outside Servants' dreams.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
You work so much, Master.  
So hard and so tirelessly.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not really.  
   
**Tristan:**   
Is that so?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
But when you do awaken,  
please use me as you would a manservant.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This is actually fun.  
   
**Tristan:**   
...What? Your mental fortitude is enough to cause even me to open my eyes in shock.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
No...could it be that after so many harsh battles,  
you are simply always mentally prepared for more?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
That is impressive all on its own. I should like to be so strong, but that is a difficult thing to be...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
So this grassy plain is my mental world?  
It's peaceful, but boring.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...No, I'm being too harsh.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
If there is some entity lurking in my psyche,  
then danger is sure to be nearby.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
We must cautious, even of something so small as a rabbit. After all, even a tiny, innocent rabbit may turn out to be the dreaded vorpal bunny.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Its got sharp...well, it bites HARD! Even the eleventh of our number, Sir Bors, was decapitated by a single attack from the dreaded vorpal bunny.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Under the light of the sun, Sir Gawain was forced to use all his strength to hold the rabbit down while Sir Lancelot beat it with Arondight!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
And then Sir Mordred darted in and kicked it viciously! And Merlin just...kept talking about the king like a broken record.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
And, finally, we defeated this greatest of foes!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's...really a thing?  
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
My apologies, Master. I may have embellished a bit.  
I was just trying to lighten the mood.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Keep your day job, Tristan.  
   
**Tristan:**   
How odd...  
Sir Bedivere always found that story hilarious.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Could it be...that he was faking it?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I-is that so...?  
   
**Tristan:**   
During our next Round Table discussion,  
I will definitely try to make Master laugh.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
Ah, it seems the real beast has come upon us while we were japing.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Is that a beast within my heart,  
or is it my malicious thoughts given form?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Either way, Master.  
Let's fight together.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Tristan:**   
They were not so tough.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
If that is the evil that dwells in my heart,  
it is...unimpressive.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
But I thought all would be resolved when we defeated those enemies...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're not waking up, though...  
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
I'm terribly sorry.  
It's almost nightfall.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
How odd for night to come even in my dreams.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
You must be tired.  
Let's find an inn so you can rest.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But to be honest,  
I'm not sure where we are in the first place.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
We have no choice but to wander aimlessly. Aside from the beast we encountered, we haven't come across a single living being.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Troubling.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I asked Master whether a ritual of some sort was needed to wake us up, but [♂ he /♀️ she} did not have a definitive answer.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Rather, [♂ he /♀️ she} asked if anything rang a bell to me.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I was asked, so I thought.  
Something necessary to wake up...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I thought of two options.  
First was suicide.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
In other words, if I slit my own throat, I would probably wake up. However, I doubt that was the answer to our troubles.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
If this was, by chance, an illusion established by the enemy, I would be a fool who abandoned my master.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
The second option: find my true enemy.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It was hard to believe that that beast was the enemy who dwelled within my heart. There must be an entity...a source...that had given life to that beast.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...Hm?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that...a city?  
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
Let's check it out, Master. That may at least spare us having to camp outside for the night.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
It's...empty...  
And this city is...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
A faint memory seems to be stirring...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
My instincts were screaming,  
warning me not to set foot in this place.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Master. Let's get out of here immediately.  
This city is dangerous.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But...  
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
You are right in thinking this place is deserted,  
but that is precisely why it is so dangerous.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Isn't this Camelot?  
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
...!!!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
How...do you know the name of this city?  
No, I guess it's obvious.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
We are in the Singularity...Camelot.  
It should have been restored already...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...But that person is not here!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Even if they were here, I would...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Choose.  
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
...Master?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It is surprising how much can be learned from the sound of breathing alone.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It can tell us whether someone is calm, angry, or sad...whether they are lying, happy, or even waiting for a chance to strike and kill.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But the breath that you, Master, just drew when you spoke, was not that of a human being.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
You are not Master.  
If you are not Master...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
YOU were the one who was dwelling within me!  
  
   
**Gawain?:**  
Hahaha. You, sir, get overeager and make a terrible mistake at the crucial moment.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
!?  
  
   
**Gawain?:**  
See, this is what happens when you abandon your attack to simply wait and see what happens.  
  
   
**Gawain?:**  
You wouldn't be in this mess had you already taken down the unknown entity disguised as Master.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
You are...no, not Sir Gawain.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
To take his form disgraces us all.  
You must disappear immediately.  
  
   
**Lancelot?:**  
Ah, Sir Tristan.  
What led you to that conclusion?  
  
   
**Lancelot?:**  
You have no basis for saying so. We are mere Servants who are not even Heroic Spirits.  
  
   
**Lancelot?:**  
We are degraded imitations that manage to establish our existence with Master acting as an anchor.  
  
   
**Enforcement Knight?:**  
...But that is not the case for you.  
  
   
**Enforcement Knight?:**  
You are the Knight of the Round Table himself. You have sworn your loyalty to a certain individual.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Shut up.  
  
   
**Bedivere?:**  
No, I will not.  
  
   
**Bedivere?:**  
The more you wish to silence us,  
the more we must speak.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...Nnngh!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Do not talk of our brotherhood!  
Do not slander our loyalty!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Every time you change forms, you besmirch the honor of the Knights of the Round Table!  
  
   
**Agravain?:**  
Then tell us your name.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Tristan. Tristan of Sadness.  
What of it?  
  
   
**Mordred?:**  
Yeah, that's right. But you're missing something, dumbass. You're a Knight of the Round Table.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
That's right. A Knight of the Round Table.  
Though in the end, I relinquished that seat...  
  
   
**???:**  
And by relinquishing that seat, you must have renewed that vow of yours. Vowed that you would offer your everything to THAT person...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
That's...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It was like opening up an old wound.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Every accusations they throw at me reminded me I was back in that Singularity.  
  
   
**Enforcement Knight?:**  
Why do you quarrel, sir?  
Didn't that massacre feel good to you?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Quiet!  
  
   
**Gawain?:**  
“Nightless.”  
  
   
**Lancelot?:**  
“Fierce.”  
  
   
**Mordred?:**  
“Rampage.”  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I'm dizzy.  
I feel like throwing up.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Don't remember...remember... You should have forgotten. No, a partial image must still be burned into your mind.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
“Reversal.”  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Irrevocable massacre. Devastation beyond hope of repair. Crime beyond hope of redemption...  
  
   
**F：???:**  
You want to have another taste of it.  
Look, you're laughing.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...!  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I unconsciously covered my mouth after hearing those words. And at that moment, I was crushed by a darkness of great pressure and intensity.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...ter...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...ster...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...Master...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
How many times...must...I commit this...mistake...?  
How can I...atone...for these...sins...?  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Gawain:**   
We heard this was an emergency,  
so we came as fast as we could!  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Hm, I'm second?  
Lancelot, reporting for duty.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Did you call for us, Master?  
...This is...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, what's going on?  
Did you call the whole Round Table?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Okay, let me explain the situation!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Tristan...Rayshifted somewhere and has disappeared.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh?  
Without Master!?  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Wait, we can Rayshift without permission?  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
I thought we could only Rayshift when accompanied by Master?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, there are few tricks you can pull,  
but nothing like whatever's been done here.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It was as if he was kidnapped...  
Tristan's Spirit Origin just disappeared...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And next thing we know,  
there's a weird new Singularity.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, it's not exactly a Singularity. It would hardly show up as even a tiny stain on the tapestry of history.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It's more like a little piece of lint. Even the faintest breeze would blow it off of the fabric of history.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
On the flip side...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It means that Tristan is in the most dire of all situations because he's in a place that could disappear at any moment.  
  
   
**Everyone:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Want to come with me?  
  
  
---  
   
**Gawain:**   
Obviously.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Leave it to us, Master.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I'll accompany you.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Pass. You've got plenty of help.  
Should be fine.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Mordred...I see...you're not quite in top form because you...ate something strange...  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
No matter how wild and strange of an animal you may be, you are still a member of the nobility...and so I can understand why you've responded as you have.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
By God!  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Sir Mordred. Are you not feeling well?  
Did you eat too much ice cream this summer?  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Or are you still angry at Sir Tristan for accidently shooting you the other day?  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
That was an unfortunate accident. You know Tristan makes foolish mistakes like that sometimes.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
You're all wrong!  
Shut-up, tri-fold-man!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
And Bedivere!  
Is THAT what happened the other day!?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I knew something was funky when I felt like something was cutting into my back...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So she didn't even notice...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
(Ack, I put my foot in my mouth...!)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Actually, I have a bad feeling about this.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Hm. Sir Mordred's animalistic instinct has never led us astray...which means this will be difficult.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Remember how you were lucky enough to run into me while I was in terrible shape because I hadn't fully healed after Lancelot?  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
I'd normally beat you without even breaking a sweat, even at night. That defeat was due entirely to my own bad luck.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
That wasn't bad luck. You're just a freakin' idiot. You were the one who let the king go without even arguing the point.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
If you had two brain cells to rub together under all that muscle, I might not've had such an easy time defeating you.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Oh?  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Oh, so you say that might've made it harder, hm?  
Tell me this: Would you have a harder time fighting me without your head!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
U-um...excuse me...!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Calm down, Mash.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
We're not gonna fight...  
We're all just messing around! Round Table jests!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jokes at the Round Table are not for the faint of heart...  
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yeah, fighting and holding grudges doesn't work so well for a team dynamic.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Just accept them as jokes that KILL.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Anyway, I'm still giving this one a pass.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I got this feeling that I need to stay right where I am.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
...I see.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Then we three shall go...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Yes.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
We shall save Sir Tristan and remove this piece of lint from history!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The lint thing is just a metaphor!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Anyway, let's go.  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah, have fun everyone!  
I'll be by to pick up your corpses later!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
If Fujimaru ends up dead,  
the world will be in real trouble.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Anyway, get in your Coffins.  
The Knights of the Round Table, go rescue Tristan!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go save Tristan.  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...I knew you'd say that.  
I went ahead and prepared the Rayshift for you.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
You're amazing, Miss Da Vinci.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It's all good as long as I can still do whatever the heck I want! Okay, time to head out!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gawain:**   
This is...!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
...  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Yes...it's Camelot, the holy city.  
But it's empty.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not detecting any enemies nearby.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I am getting a Servant reading up ahead, though.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Wouldn't that be Sir Tristan?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Actually, the Spirit Origin values are fluctuating. Whatever it is, it's not stable.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please be careful, everyone.  
You too, Master.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
No point standing around.  
Let's go see if we can talk to him.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Let's go...!  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
!?  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Ugh...!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
What!?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...I have been waiting for you all.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Tristan...!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This aura...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Something's...different about him.  
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
Master.  
I...I'm no longer just.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
The moment I deemed that killing innocent citizens was fine, I should have ceased to exist as a Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
The gift of Inversion is simply an excuse.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Tristan, are you saying that your memories from the Sixth Singularity have...!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That wasn't you!  
   
**Tristan:**   
No, THAT was the real me!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But you were reversed!  
   
**Tristan:**   
What of it if I was reversed!?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
It was still me!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Bedivere:**   
I don't quite understand the situation...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
But Sir Tristan, open your eyes. No matter how terrible your actions, there is no sin that cannot be redeemed.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
So long as you are truly remorseful...even if you are never forgiven, you still have a chance at atonement.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Sir Bedivere, my comrade.  
You do not know.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Moments ago, I experienced the reversed version of myself.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
...!  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
What!?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I now understand why I know nothing of love.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
A monster so evil as me should never be loved.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I should be killed.  
Please, destroy me!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
A fool like me deserves no more than having his comrades lop his head off.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
That is absolute nonsense, Sir Tristan!  
That is no reason for us to draw our swords against you!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Then I shall kill Master.  
  
   
**All Three:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
There's no cause for surprise here.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
As I said before... The inverted me is my true self.  
It is only natural that I should drown myself in malice.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
...!  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Master.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
I don't understand what's happened,  
but we need to stop Tristan first!  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
That's right. Sir Tristan, we may be at least partially the cause of your madness...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Honestly...  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Master, please get behind us.  
This...may turn into an astonishingly violent battle.  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
My Airgetlám knows no mercy.  
I shall destroy that sinister harp's sadness at its source!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Lancelot:**   
Ungh!  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Even after the beating we've given you, you're still standing! Where are you getting this endurance?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
In addition to my Gift of Inversion, I have also been given the Gifts of Nightless and Rampage.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Who gave them to you!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It certainly shouldn't be the Lion King.  
She should already have disappeared!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I do not know myself.  
It must be some cruel and unfathomable being.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
But even that bit of ridiculousness made me realize something: I am truly a monster.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
And I never even realized it, all while I lamented over my own origin, crying about my own inability to understand human emotion!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
That's why...I could never be loved.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's not true!  
Tristan, you're...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash, it's no use.  
   
**Mash:**   
...Tristan, I believe in you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're wrong, Tristan.  
   
**Tristan:**   
Then in order to prove my villainy...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I shall...I shall lop your head off...Master!!!  
  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Tristan!!!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mordred:**   
What the hell are you whinging about, Bird Boy?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mordred!?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yo, Tristan.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I see you did not come with the party.  
How unlike you, wild dog that you are, to cower in fear.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Okay, everyone, STOP CALLING ME A DOG!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Ugh. Fine. If I'm a dog, what's that make you?  
A little bug?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
A tiny bug buzzing about...  
A pissant that doesn't know what love is?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
As ever, your provocations are the most grating of insults.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, I got plenty more for you when you get back.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
You're given all those gifts, then you bitch and bitch and bitch, then fall into some desperate madness!? What a damn wimp! Pathetic!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
What would you know?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hell if I know.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
But now I know the reason why I didn't tag along.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
The real expert in self-flagellation is the damn king.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Your quibbling and all that whining would REALLY piss her off!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
And if SHE's going to put in an appearance, all I could do is stay the hell away, or we might all end up killing each other.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
What are you saying...  
No...impossible...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
It can't be!!!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
I have come in answer to a call from afar.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Sir, I see you are lost.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...King of the sacred lance!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Even for you, I will not compromise!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Then as your king, I will have your submission,  
even if I must beat it into you.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I am a king, but also a member of the Knights of the Round Table.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Should my knights disagree,  
I am fully prepared to handle their quarrel.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Sir Tristan, show me your bow and its infinite arrows. With my sacred lance, I shall annihilate the source of your melancholy.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...Very well.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Sing, my Failnaught.  
Sound the melody of my lament!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Sacred lance, removing restraints.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Master of Chaldea, I ask of you:  
please take temporary command.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I need to give this thickheaded knight a moment of silence and reflection.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course!  
   
**Altria:**   
I appreciate your willingness to help.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...Let's go!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thanks!  
   
**Altria:**   
No need to thank me.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
After all, this is my duty.  
Now, let's go!  
  
   
  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**B：Tristan:**   
Ungh!  
My King! You do not understand me!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
No, it is you who does not understand yourself.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
No... It's not that you don't understand,  
but that you refuse to.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
The light of Rhongomyniad will pierce through your blessings. And then...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Master will destroy your hesitation.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Master of Chaldea.  
Do you know of Tristan's legend?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
While he did learn what love is, deep in his heart, he averted his gaze from it.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Tristan...  
  
  
---  
**B：Tristan:**   
I...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Love and guilt are two different things.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Didn't you want to love?  
  
  
---  
   
**B：Tristan:**   
!  
  
   
**B：Tristan:**   
I...I...  
  
   
**???:**  
It's a black sail, Sir Tristan.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Even as my eyes grew dim from poison,  
my hearing did not fail me.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I heard a trembling voice,  
a whisper like one confessing their crimes.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Regret, sorrow, hatred. And yet another pure emotion remained, untainted by them.  
  
   
**B：Tristan:**   
Ah, I see. It was inevitable.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I was truly very sorry.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I must have hurt her so much...enough that it compelled her to say those words.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Iseult. My Iseult with the white hands...the one who was by my side as I died.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
As my wife, you were loyal even while I was not.  
And now the only thing I can do is believe.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Yes. The black sail must have come.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
There was gratitude.  
There was compassion.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
There was atonement.  
Was there...ever love?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
My thoughts grow calmer. Is an inconstant man like me truly worthy and able to love such a good woman?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
No. I realized that at the moment of my death.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
That wild, passionate love I felt was the product of a love potion, not something within me.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But I believed that was love. I believed it, and so continued to betray my Iseult of the white hands.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I am truly a monster that does not know love.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I was only ever loved by others,  
never able to love another myself.  
  
   
**B：Tristan:**   
...No. That can't be true. I remember.  
At the time, I was thinking...  
  
   
**B：Tristan:**   
“It would be my greatest regret if I died right here...”  
  
   
**B：Tristan:**   
“While leaving the most gentle woman I know to be so lonely and sad. I want to apologize to her...to talk to her...to tell her...”  
  
   
**B：Tristan:**   
“And I want to ask her: 'May I love you?'”  
  
   
**Narration:**   
And without having a chance to ask that myself, I made her tell me those words.  
  
   
**B：Tristan:**   
That's right...I...  
  
   
**B：Tristan:**   
I should have asked my question.  
Even if the only answer would have been a curse or insult.  
  
   
**B：Tristan:**   
Even had it led to me losing my love,  
I would have accepted that as just...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
(...The evil Gift has disappeared. But...the fairy princess, my older sister...does this mean she has manifested somewhere...?)  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Sir Tristan. I ask of you:  
Do you still think you have never loved anyone?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...No.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
What I lacked in life was not love, but courage.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I was constantly fearful of losing love, and therefore could not allow myself to love anything.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I loved two women. And that is fine.  
And I will not discuss what that led to.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Thank you, Master.  
And my king.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I can finally awaken from my dream.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Gawain, Lancelot, Tristan...and...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
You must continue to dedicate yourselves to restoring humanity. Never forget to be proud of being Knights of the Round Table!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, good, she's gone. Okay, Tristan.  
I'm gonna give it to you straight:  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Iseult of white hands and blondie Iseult? I'm pretty sure they'd have kicked a two-timing ass like you to the curb given half a chance.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Before you died of that poison, you should've gotten a big damn smack to the face!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Ha... I never imagined you of all people would be the one to point out the truth.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
It's quite vexing, so remember this one thing when we get back:  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I shall rain limitless arrows upon your unnecessary and demeaning personal attacks!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah, firing off a buncha arrows while running away like a bitch is pretty much the definitive Archer move.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Heh. Hold it right there, Sir Mordred.  
There's still one last thing that Sir Tristan needs to do.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Yes, a very important thing.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh?  
What're you...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...?  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Haha, yes, indeed, hahaha.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
He was beyond confused...only able to snap to his senses after our king attacked him...he even attacked us with his Gift.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
And even the King was so focused on lecturing Sir Tristan, she only glanced toward us at the very end.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
No, no...  
It's not that that made us jealous.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Sirs?  
I mean, guys?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Are you...super pissed?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Well, okay, this did get out of hand enough that everyone had to get involved...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
But at least...at least the conclusion was heartwarming, right...?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I understand how they feel...  
  
  
---  
   
**Bedivere:**   
Indeed. All sins can be atoned for, Tristan.  
Whether you will be forgiven is another matter.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Master.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah.  
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
Please...see to my funeral...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that another Round Table joke!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Tristan:**   
Not a joke...!  
  
   
**All Three:**   
Brace yourself!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Sorry I took over.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, I don't mind. But do you think Tristan and the others are all right?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
What do you mean, all right?  
They're all set to come back whenever.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, I mean...is anyone holding a grudge?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Grudge? 'Course not.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
It'd be different if we went after each other all serious and stuff.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
But they're just bickering with each other.  
Just playing around.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Playing around?  
Really?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah.  
Wanna bet on it?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
By tomorrow night, the four of them will be rolling around on the floor like a bunch of morons laughing like this was the funniest damn thing ever.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Honestly, the Knights of the Round Table are all complete nutjobs!
