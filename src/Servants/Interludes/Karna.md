# Karna  
  
## Heroic Spirit of the Charity  
  
**Mash:**   
Master, are you going to eat?  
I'll come with you.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You can come too, Fou...  
What? Is that... Karna?

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Heyo-Chal-Deluxe!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Heyo-Chal-Deluxe!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Karna:**   
Heyo-Chal-Deluxe.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What? ...Senpai? Karna!?  
What's going on!?  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...That's my question. I was told that's the standard greeting in Chaldea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Who... Who told you that?  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Master.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What?  
...No way...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I didn't know such a wonderful greeting existed... Senpai, how come you didn't tell me?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I came up with it yesterday.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sorry. I forgot.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Please say that to me, too.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't tell me...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Heyo, something.  
The one you did, with the high-five.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
H-Heyo-Chal-Deluxe.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Heyo-Chal-Deluxe!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Heyo-Chal-Deluxe.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;I see. This has a wonderful effect. It makes you feel...light and relaxed.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
However, Chaldea is on high-alert right now. So from now on, this greeting will be banned.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Okay, I'm sorry...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Mash can be scary sometimes...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
By the way, what are you doing, Karna?  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Oh, I'm about to go buy some bread at the store.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At Da Vinci's store?  
If you haven't had lunch, why don't we...  
  
   
**Karna:**   
No, Doctor... Roman was his name?  
He asked me to buy some for him.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
Doctor. It's me. Mash.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm going to get to the point.  
Why did you ask Karna to run errands for you?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, I've been busy, so I just thought...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Using a Heroic Spirit... To buy bread? I'm pretty sure there are other more useful things...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, I meant it as a joke!  
But he just nodded and walked out of the room...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that right?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And you were okay with that?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Karna:**   
Yes, what the Doctor said is correct.  
There isn't a single false statement.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...Did I do something wrong?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No... I mean, I wouldn't know how to answer that myself...  
  
   
**Karna:**   
I see. If nothing's wrong, I'm going to the store.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm so sorry! Da Vinci's Super Special Delicious Bread just ran out.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Oh... I see.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(He looks so depressed, Senpai!)  
You always have extra, I wonder what happened?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, we finally used up all the flour we had.  
Dr. Roman also told us not to waste it.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I got it. Let's use this chance to procure a new supply route!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Of course you will help me, right? They sell good flour in France, around here.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
If you can stuff it into my special Da Vinci Storage Bag,  
you should be able to bring back some crops to Chaldea.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Normally, we'd purposely realign Chaldeas to manifest resources from our Rayshift destination but...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Using Chaldea like that would truly deplete our resources... It just doesn't balance out.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So in times like this, we need cheat a little.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Understood. Commencing Rayshift.  
Master, I'm sorry, but please get ready.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He agreed immediately!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
O-Okay.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Understood.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Well. That's the reason we're in this French farming village.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm. How did things end up like this in the short time I was looking at Magiâ˜†Mari's blog?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's all the Doctor's fault!  
  
   
**Karna:**   
That village... Hmm?  
  
   
**Villager:**   
Oh, a traveler... No, looking at that spear... Perhaps you are part of the French army?  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...No, I'm not.  
  
   
**Villager:**   
N-No way... It's been three days since the bandits seized our village...  
  
   
**Villager:**   
Just when I thought someone had finally come to save us...  
  
   
**Karna:**   
That sounds terrible. I will help you.  
  
   
**Villager:**   
What? A-Are you sure? But... Only with this amount of people...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It won't be a problem.  
Karna... Let's hurry to the village!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Bandit:**   
Hell yeah! Bring us some booze! Get me some women too!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's enough! For your health, please refrain from alcohol and women!  
  
   
**Bandit:**   
Who the hell are you? A kid, a girl, and some skinny guy...  
  
   
**Bandit:**   
Ha! Hey guys, go teach them a lesson!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Karna:**   
That's enough. Do you want to spend all your remaining time on momentary desires?  
  
   
**Bandit:**   
What... What are these guys? T-They're too powerful!? L-Let's get out of here!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Persistently aiming at their vital spots, and accurately reducing their wills to fight to make them surrender as quickly as possible...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It was totally one sided, artistic even.  
I learned a lot.  
  
   
**Villager:**   
T-Thank you very much, traveler.  
I have no idea how to repay you...  
  
   
**Karna:**   
You don't need to thank me.  
We couldn't just let your village be destroyed.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
By the way, can you give us some wheat?  
We'll pay the proper market price for it.  
  
   
**Villager:**   
W-Wheat? That's all you need?  
Please take as much as you need!  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...No, just enough to fill this bag.  
I heard I can pay you with these silver coins.  
  
   
**Villager:**   
Well, yes...then please take this.  
Is that really enough for you?  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Yes, I appreciate it.  
I'm sorry for the trouble.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Karna...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
All right! This is Da Vinci's Super Special Delicious Bread Mark 2!  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...Splendid skill, or craftsmanship rather.  
I can even feel divinity from the steam.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
You used to bake pizza before... As expected from an almighty genius, this is an almighty oven. Hat's off to you.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Sorry to make you wait, Doctor. Were you able to withstand the hunger? This is the bread you wanted.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, thank you...  
I'm sorry about the extra work.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Oh no, it was a good experience.  
Anyway, I will take my leave now.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Karna is looking...a little bit strange, don't you think?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Hero of Benefaction... I heard he even offered his armor when someone begged for it, even though it was his flesh and blood.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Flesh and blood?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Armor?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, as long as he's wearing that gold armor no one can harm him.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He's a hero who relinquished even that precious armor when asked for it.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A widow's mite in a way... Takes only what is necessary and only the amount he really needs, that's him.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He is noble and aloof, yet engages with others as his peers&mdash; He is truly a model hero.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What a wonderful person. I can't believe the Doctor would ask him to do such a mundane task.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I was engaged in a task I couldn't leave, so... I am sorry.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Next time I'll ask Arjuna!  
You know... Since he's from India just like Karna!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
T-That's an even bigger issue!  
Please let us do your trivial tasks!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!
