**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is this place...?  
   
**C：???:**  
There's that catchphrase I've been waiting for!  
Where am I? Who am I?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
If that's the first thing on your mind,  
then Senpai hasn't experienced SE.RA.PH yet!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
In which case, I'm here to tell you that you're about to have a bad day! A bad trip, if you like!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
There's gonna be more crazy psychedelic stuff down here than you can shake the proverbial stick at!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
But never mind that now; I'm not gonna follow up on it later. Just write off any weird stuff you see here as “well that just happened” and you'll be A-OK!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm back at the bottom of SE.RA.PH...!?  
   
**C：???:**  
Huh!? You know this is SE.RA.PH!?  
And here I thought I'd erased those memories...  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Hmm. You must be an even rarer Senpai than I thought if you're able to break the fourth wall...  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Then again, maybe you just downloaded info about SE.RA.PH unconsciously when you formed your contract with Lip...  
  
   
**C：???:**  
...and now you remember this place the same way you remember a bad dream.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Well, I can probably let that slide. I do love enforcing my rules, but I also love spunky Masters who go around breaking them!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
It's kind of like how a cat enjoys toying with a mouse whose struggles just make it more fun!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**C：???:**  
Aaanyway, that's enough setup!  
  
   
**BB:**   
Welcome, castaway on the digital sea,  
to the Spiritron Virtual World!  
  
   
**BB:**   
I'm BB, the High-Grade AI that keeps humanity healthy, here to serve as your guide.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Those of you who already know me will no doubt be thinking, “You again!? Now what've you done!?”  
  
   
**BB:**   
Those of you who don't know me, I want you to gasp in surprise at this beautiful angelic kouhai swooping in to join you in the depths of hell. Okay? Okay.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I'm sorry, what?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This is a lot to take in all at once...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
Huh? You don't know how you got here? You thought this was supposed to be Lip's interlude, not mine?  
  
   
**BB:**   
Oh, Master...  
How could you?  
  
   
**BB:**   
First you shamelessly pursue me, make me bring you all the way to this secluded spot where no one will bother us, and then you just...forget?  
  
   
**BB:**   
What happened to that monstrous libido? Here you have this sumptuous, gourmet banquet before you, and now you're telling me you'd rather go eat some grass...?  
  
   
**BB:**   
Well then, I guess we're just going to have to do something about that, my little idiot of a Master! This calls for drastic measures!  
  
   
**BB:**   
Get ready for my patented Awakening Beeeam!  
Kazap! Flashback music, go!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...(Sigh)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You seem down lately.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You seem kind of worn out.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...Buh!?  
N-no I'm not! Really!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Sure, my shoulders are a little stiff, and some of the more insensitive people have been annoying me...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...and I keep worrying about how much larger I might get if my Spirit Origin keeps growing...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
But that's all! Just your basic,  
ordinary, run-of-the-mill anxieties!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
It's nothing you need concern yourself with, Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
If you need to talk, I'm happy to listen.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...Thank you, Fujimaru.  
I really appreciate that.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
But I promise, it's no big deal.  
I've just been wondering if I'm really all that helpful.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I know I'm stronger than the other Servants,  
but I'm also a lot less mobile and agile...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
So I find myself thinking that if I could change that,  
I could handle battles all on my own...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I know how much commanding so many Servants at once tires you out, so I'd love to be able to help you with that...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Aw, Lip...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(She's so thoughtful...)  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Honestly, I don't even know what everyone else is doing here. It's not like they're any help.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I think they have a lot of nerve, using up your magical energy, as weak as they are.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Plus, they act all high and mighty just 'cause they happened to get here before me. Who do they think they are?  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
The whole idea of seniority mattering is stupid! You'd think they'd be ashamed at us showing them up so badly even though we were just born recently...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um, Lip...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(...This is getting a little...heavy...)  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...Not to mention...they've been teasing me again lately...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I've been doing my best to learn from my mistakes and not go around breaking so many things, but...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Uh... I'm sorry, it's nothing.  
Please, just forget about it.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
The point is, my problems are simple and boring!  
I can do something about...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
No, I have to do something about them myself!  
So I will, and I'll be my old self by tomorrow, I promise!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...Huh.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Wh...what the...? That's weird...  
I just got really dizzy...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Look out...!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Eek!  
N-no, Fujimaru, don't!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I can't hold myself up anymore...  
I-if you try to support me from the front...!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Oh gosh, oh gosh...  
Fujimaru just fell in!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
BB! BB! You're the last person I'd want to ask,  
but I need your heeelp!  
  
   
**BB:**   
There, you're all caught up.  
Now do you get what's going on?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then, that means...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So I'm inside Lip's Breast Valley...!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
Bingo! You're trapped deep within Lip even as we speak!  
  
   
**BB:**   
It usually looks more like the dump where they toss royal family coffins, but I thought you'd feel more at home if I gave it a SE.RA.PH-style makeover!  
  
   
**BB:**   
Still, what's with this place? I thought Breast Valley was just a term for cleavage, not an actual valley!  
  
   
**BB:**   
I know there are plenty of big boob lovers out there, but this is ridiculous! Hasn't her designer ever seen a real woman!?  
  
   
**BB:**   
As an AI myself, I find it atrocious! What sort of demon came up with a skill in such poor taste!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You did.  
   
**BB:**   
How could you say that...? Sure, I may have been personally responsible for Lip's creation...  
  
   
**BB:**   
...but I wasn't being malicious with her character design or anything. I just poured everything I disliked about myself into her...  
  
   
**BB:**   
...and added the fourth-dimensional pocket in her rack 'cause I thought it'd be funny...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is there a way out of here?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
Oh, right. Escaping should be the priority.  
I knew that.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Bluntly, ending up in Lip's Breast Valley is a one-way ticket to the trash heap.  
  
   
**BB:**   
What gets thrown in here cannot return to reality. You're doomed to live out the rest of your days wandering around in here, without even the sweet embrace of death to bring you comfort.  
  
   
**BB:**   
...Juuust kidding! That was the old Passionlip.  
  
   
**BB:**   
After she was given that miraculous second chance, she took a hard look at her own monstrous nature, reflected on it, learned from it...  
  
   
**BB:**   
...and now, she can at least pull her contracted Master back out!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well that's a relief... Okay, let's get on with it.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
Hehehe. Hehehehe. Hehehehehehehehe!  
  
   
**BB:**   
Not so fast! You didn't think I'd let a juicy situation like this slide, did you?  
  
   
**BB:**   
I mean, now that you're here,  
don't you want to see how deep this valley goes?  
  
   
**BB:**   
Every girl's got things she wants to keep hidden.  
What she's really like...her weaknesses...her turn-ons...  
  
   
**BB:**   
Well, here in our world,  
we call those places our Secret Gardens.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Back on the far side of the moon, we were supposed to uncover each other's Secret Gardens, understand them, and accept each other. How embarrassing!  
  
   
**BB:**   
Of course, as the world's most perfect kouhai, I didn't have any such weaknesses myself, but that's a story for another time.  
  
   
**BB:**   
In your case, learning about Lip's SG will make your bond as Master and Servant even stronger.  
  
   
**BB:**   
So what do you say? Don't you want to find out Lip's juiciest secrets? In particular, the ones in her second SG, Masochistic Nature.  
  
   
**BB:**   
The whole reason Lip hasn't been herself lately is 'cause this particular SG has been out of whack.  
  
   
**BB:**   
That whole bit about her having to do something about her problems herself was actually part of the problem.  
  
   
**BB:**   
I mean, why should she do that when she's got a perfectly capable Master here to lean on? I say you two should face what's in Lip's heart together.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Do that, and Passionlip the Alter Ego is bound to get even stronger!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mmm, I don't like the idea of doing this without her permission...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Monotone) If it'll make her stronger, I guess I don't have a choice.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
Great! Then let's get this crazy escape room started!  
I already went and mapped out Lip's mind like a CPU!  
  
   
**BB:**   
I call it: the Sakura Labyrinth - Lite!  
A completely digital EEG just for love and trauma!  
  
   
**BB:**   
Don't worry, getting there will be a nice, gentle slope.  
All you have to do is keep making your way up.  
  
   
**BB:**   
You might run into an obstacle or two on the way, but all you'll need to get past them is wisdom, bravery, and spunk, and I'm sure you've got those in spades!  
  
   
**BB:**   
What's that? Wouldn't it make more sense to go DOWN if you're delving into secrets? Going up should just bring you to the surface?  
  
   
**BB:**   
You sure are a detail-oriented ant, aren't you...  
Look, this is just a skill, okay?  
  
   
**BB:**   
It's way too soon for you to traipse into her mind's Realm of Innocence and start enhancing her Noble Phantasm.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Once you're at that level, you and Lip will need to have a good long talk before you even think about trying that.  
  
   
**BB:**   
For now, I'm going nice and easy on you, so this'll just be the Sakura Labyrinth's newbie zone!  
  
   
**BB:**   
Ready to enter a fleeting wonderland, little senpai?  
  
   
**BB:**   
Well that didn't take long! Look out, Master.  
That's the ruthless Band Brigade!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You mean there are Servants here!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
Of course. We're inside Lip's boo&ndash;er, mind, after all. It's chock full of all the mental trauma she experienced at Chaldea.  
  
   
**BB:**   
In this guy's case, she probably asked him to teach her how to play an instrument and now resents him for holding her to his high standards.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Lip's not the type to forget a grudge, no matter how slight it might be. She's really good at repressing her feelings, too... (Sigh)  
  
   
**BB:**   
Still, at least these guys should be easy pickin&ndash;I mean, easy to defeat!  
  
   
**BB:**   
And since we can't go any further until we beat them,  
I'll do you a favor and step up to the challenge myself!  
  
   
**BB:**   
Just sit back and enjoy the show your adorable kouhai's going to put on for you, Senpai!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I still can't believe I'm walking around her mind...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This feels wrong...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
It's insensitive AND immoral, right?  
That's what the far side of the moon is all about♡  
  
   
**BB:**   
Hmm, looks like we've still got a little ways to go until the first real obstacle.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Why don't we take advantage of this time to go over the finer points of what an Alter Ego is?  
  
   
**BB:**   
First off, when I say Alter Ego, I'm talking about the Servants that were born from me...  
  
   
**BB:**   
The Sakura series, like Meltryllis and Passionlip.  
  
   
**BB:**   
See, the original BB&ndash;the one I was copied from&ndash;went a little buggy once.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Even though she was an AI,  
she tried to emulate humans.  
  
   
**BB:**   
She attempted to remake the world to suit her own purposes, just like they do.  
  
   
**BB:**   
And to do that, she modified herself over and over...  
  
   
**BB:**   
...on the far side of the moon,  
where there's no concept of time.  
  
   
**BB:**   
One day, she tried leveling up again and again in Void Space before a certain Master finished their fifth battle.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Usually, that kind of growth should have been impossible. She was never designed to be expanded that way.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Imagine trying to slap a combustion engine on a manual scooter and you'll have some idea of what that was like.  
  
   
**BB:**   
But even though she wasn't designed for it,  
BB kept adding engines to her tiny frame.  
  
   
**BB:**   
...She started with an engine for the same size scooter as her, then moved on to one for a motorcycle.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Next, she added a car engine. Then one for a pickup truck... A dump truck... A private jet... A battle cruiser...  
  
   
**BB:**   
It was like looking at the engineering equivalent of a dumpster fire. Or maybe like cancer cells spreading throughout a host.  
  
   
**BB:**   
But it still wasn't nearly enough to achieve her goal.  
  
   
**BB:**   
She kept modifying herself more and more radically.  
  
   
**BB:**   
A jet engine. An oil tanker. A power plant. A nuclear reactor. All sorts of engines her little frame was never built to support.  
  
   
**BB:**   
She piled on one ill-fitting addition after another, and ended up turning into a Giga Structure.  
  
   
**BB:**   
By that point, her insides were a hot mess. Her human thought processes were bound to get all screwed up!  
  
   
**BB:**   
And that is what led to the birth of the Sakura Five.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Somewhere along the way, BB got the idea to separate her expanding egos and functionalities from herself, and make them into her assistants.  
  
   
**BB:**   
When all was said and done, five Alter Egos had been born. Five AIs created from BB's own emotions.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Emotions she cut off from herself because she decided they were unnecessary... Well, not quite. She feared them because she couldn't control them any longer.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Meltryllis, the Alter Ego of pleasure.  
Passionlip, the Alter Ego of love and hatred.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Violet, the Alter Ego of purity.  
Kingprotea, the Alter Ego of desire.  
  
   
**BB:**   
And Kazuradrop, the Alter Ego of affection.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Every Ego was born from BB's emotions,  
but Lip was one of the most dangerous.  
  
   
**BB:**   
She refused to face her flaws, demanded unconditional love, and hated anyone who wouldn't give it to her.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Like they say, it's a thin line between love and hate. As an Ego, Lip blindly loved and loathed whomever she set her sights on.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Still, after a bunch of shit went down, she learned there's no such thing as unconditional love, and she's been working on accepting that!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No such thing as unconditional love, huh...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Lip's a hard worker.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
True. It just goes to show that if you want to be loved, it doesn't matter how cute you are.  
  
   
**BB:**   
You still need the courage to put yourself out there, the sincerity to work on your flaws, and consideration for others!  
  
   
**BB:**   
Of course, I've already got that sort of thing down pat. I'm always thinking up new ways to trip up humanity!  
  
   
**BB:**   
Hm? What's with the look? You don't believe I have that all down? I'll have you know I was being seriou&ndash;  
  
   
**BB:**   
Aha! That was a whip cracking against an innocent female body if ever I heard one! Sounds like we're finally reaching SG territory!  
  
   
**BB:**   
Come on, Senpai! I think we're about to see one of Lip's secrets for ourselves☆  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Ah...!  
Please... Please stop...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I didn't do anything wrong...  
Why are you being so mean to me...?  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
Shut up! What's with all that flab!?  
You're an embarrassment to the entire Shinsengumi!  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
Not even Okita would ever let herself go that much!  
You're wasting your best weapon!  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
A dumpling like you is all fat and no flavor! Only thing you're good for now is testing my new branding iron!  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
It says “Incorrigible/The full moon glows in autumn/A mirror of fire”!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Please don't make me into a roasted dumpling...! But if you have to, please at least spare me the awful haiku!  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
That wasn't a haiku! I was just thinking out loud!  
I can do way better than that if I put my mind to it!  
  
   
**BB:**   
W-well, this is horrible!  
  
   
**BB:**   
Why's he making Lip sit on the floor while he whacks her shoulder with a giant paper fan!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Vice-Commander!? What do you think you're doing!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Putting your mind to it won't make you a poet!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
Shut up! Can't you see I'm in the middle of an interrogation!? ...Huh?  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
Oh, it's you, Fujimaru.  
What're you doing in the discipline room?  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
A foot soldier like you doesn't belong here.  
Get back to your quarters.  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
And don't tell anyone else what you saw here. As for the haiku, well...that sort of thing just slips out when the other soldiers aren't around.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(So that was his best effort...)  
   
**BB:**   
...(Sigh). I'm preeetty sure this isn't how this scene actually went down, but let me just make sure.  
  
   
**BB:**   
What are you doing here, Lip Traumatizer No. 2?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What're you doing here?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
What am I doing...?  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
Well, you know, I'm...  
Hm? Come to think of it, what AM I doing here...?  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
I remember I came here because I heard there were huge&ndash;I mean, premium dumplings to be had... So why am I holding a giant paper fan?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's what I want to know.  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
Yeah, that figures... It's weird. I got real pissed off for some reason, and before I knew it, I was back to my old tricks...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you like torturing people?  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
What was that?  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Eee...!  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
No, I don't. But I'm good at it. If the Shinsengumi needed someone tortured, I was the guy who did it.  
  
   
**BB:**   
You sure about that? 'Cause you're handling that paper fan like it's second nature.  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
It's not that...!  
He...he took me prisoner out of nowhere...!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I thought he was nice at first, since he pointed out my bad posture and said it would make my shoulders stiff.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
But after I talked a bit about how Berserkers are just glass cannons, and how I have all sorts of defenses...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...and he doesn't have any way to defend himself even though the battle only really begins once stamina starts running low, and couldn't you say he's just asking to get killed...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...he started going on about how slovenly I was...  
  
   
**BB:**   
Ah geez... Lip's tendency to rile people up without even trying to strikes again...  
  
   
**BB:**   
So what? As the oni of the battlefield, you couldn't stand to look at Lip and all her excess defense&ndash;er, chest padding?  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
Don't be stupid! What do you take me for,  
girl with the cool black cape!?  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
I don't have any problem with her chest!  
On a scale of one to ten, I give it a hundred!  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
The problem is her pitiful posture! She's got first-class goods, but she can't show them off properly!  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
If she did, I'd rank it two hundred out of ten!  
It'd be the greatest thing ever! That's what I can't stand!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Aaaaaah...! P-please don't hit my shoulders!  
The stiffness is just melting away!  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
At any rate! As long as I draw breath, I won't let anyone get away with not living up to their full potential!  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
This woman's coming with the Shinsengumi! Your black cape may be cool, but that doesn't mean I'll go easy on you if you get in our way.  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
While I'm at it, I think I'll have Okita start copying her diet! Maybe then she'll finally start filling out herself! Bahahaha!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's no use... We'll just have to defeat him!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Is this what Lip deals with every day...?)  
   
  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**A：Mysterious Okita X:**   
You're through!  
  
   
**Space Toshizo:**   
Gaaaaaah!  
Okita you, bastard! Damn you, Okitaaa!!!  
  
   
**A：Mysterious Okita X:**   
I'm sorry for all the trouble our breast fiend caused you.  
  
   
**A：Mysterious Okita X:**   
It's even hard for us to tell when he's joking, so it must have been bewildering for you. Again, I'm sorry.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Nn...n...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Huh? What am I doing here...  
Is that you, Master?  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Is this a dream I'm having? The one where [♂ Prince /♀️ Princess}  
Charming comes to save me when I'm in distress...?  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I don't see how that could be...  
But, if you're here right now, then... (Gasp!)  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I don't know what's going on, but I must be dreaming! And that means I should be able to have things here turn out just the way I want!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
(Quiet squeeing)  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
(Heart pounding)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry to say this after you've already lain down, but...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Come on Lip, get up. It's really me.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Hey, we were just getting to the good part!  
I might be dense, but you won't fool me this time.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
This is my mental world, and Master's a human.  
There's no way [♂ he'd /♀️ she'd} be in here!  
  
   
**BB:**   
Oh, but there is! How, you ask?  
Because I helped [♂ him /♀️ her} get here!  
  
   
**BB:**   
Believe me, this is the one and only Fujimaru, live and in the flesh.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Go ahead, pick your lazy ass up off the floor and scan [♂ him /♀️ her} yourself if you don't believe me.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Besides, Fujimaru wouldn't even be here right now if it wasn't for you.  
  
   
**BB:**   
As if it wasn't bad enough you slipped and fell on top of [♂ him /♀️ her}...  
  
   
**BB:**   
...you just had to go and send [♂ him /♀️ her} tumbling into your oversized Breast Valley.  
  
   
**BB:**   
So watch it, okay? If I hadn't been here, you'd have made a real mess of things...Fujimaru included.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
No way...  
That really is you, Fujimaru!?  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
But, this is my mind, not Breast Valley!  
I know they're both digital spaces, but how...!?  
  
   
**BB:**   
Oh, that was all me. I set it up so the way out of your valley took [♂ him /♀️ her} straight to your mind dungeon.  
  
   
**BB:**   
After all, there shouldn't be any secrets between a Master and [♂ his /♀️ her} Servant, right?  
  
   
**BB:**   
So just resign yourself to the fact that there's no getting off this emotional roller coaster now☆ What kind of shocking revelations does the next SG have in store about Lip? I can't wait to find out☆  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Oh gosh, oh gosh...  
Please, don't! It's too embarrassing!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
BB! Why'd you have to stick your nose in things now, you big jerk!?  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...And now, here we are, making our way to the exit...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Now I see.  
I'm sorry for the trouble my real self caused you.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I'm the Lip from her mind's second Secret Garden,  
so I don't know how much use I can be...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...but I'll do the best I can to help you get back out, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Although... (Sigh)  
I don't see why Mothe&ndash;BB is here too.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
And why is she even acting like my mother now, anyway? She can buzz off for all I care.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Stupid insensitive BB. Stupid nosy nurse, always doing more harm than good. She's just a cruel AI who doesn't know the difference between caring and controlling.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Even when she realizes her charge hates her “treatment,” she can't stop herself.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Can you imagine getting so swept up in your own desires you lose sight of everything else? It's pathetic.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
She loves to call me dense, but what am I supposed to do about it? If I am dense, the only possible explanation for it is that I got it from her!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
If she wants me to wise up, then she'd better start by fixing her own issues first.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Of course, we all know she'll just bug out the more she tries to fix herself. She never was very smart.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I've never heard you be so aggressive before...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(...I see. So this is the SG2 version...)  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
...Much as it pains me to say it, given how she's one of my own Alter Egos, this is Passionlip's true nature.  
Or at least, one side of it.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Masochistic Nature might be a pretty horrid skill that makes you an object of derision just for existing, but it's not like there's no reason at all for it.  
  
   
**BB:**   
The person at the center of it is still at least partially responsible.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...Hmph. No I'm not! I didn't do anything wrong!  
I've been doing a lot of self-reflection, you know!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I've stopped depending so much on others, I'm doing more things for myself... I'm learning and growing every day!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Right, Fujimaru!?  
I have grown, haven't I!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You sure have. (Maintaining eye contact)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You sure have. (Looking downward)  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
See!? I'm not the same old Lip who got bullied just for existing anymore!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I've mentally grown up a whole bunch! In fact, I'll say it right now: I'm officially leaving my Masochistic Nature behind forever!  
  
   
**BB:**   
Yikes... I didn't realize her head had gotten as big as her chest...  
  
   
**BB:**   
No wonder she hasn't been feeling right. Our SGs may contain secrets and weaknesses, but they're not flaws...  
  
   
**BB:**   
Not to mention she evidently doesn't even understand that personalities don't change on a dime.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Still, I'm sure it won't be long before reality slaps her back down. For now, I see our next obstacle.  
  
   
**BB:**   
From here on, you and Lip can do all the fighting.  
  
   
**BB:**   
How far will Lip and her good girl act take you?  
I look forward to finding out from my director's chair!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
It looks like we're in some kind of plaza.  
...Phew, I don't see any Reliefs.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Reliefs?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
O-oh, uh, in the Sakura Labyrinth, Reliefs are the world's edges that block off the exits.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Uh, they're kind of like...the girl who's acting as the labyrinth's core is engraved into its walls at the same time...?  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
B-but that doesn't matter right now! This isn't the far side of the moon anyway, so please, just forget I said anything!  
  
   
**BB:**   
That's right. This is a simplified Sakura Labyrinth.  
You won't find any Venus Statues here.  
  
   
**BB:**   
But that's not to say there aren't some other guards around. Take a look over thataway, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Damn, we were just getting to the good part.  
Where'd that overgrown freak go, anyway?  
  
   
**Medb:**   
How'd someone so huge manage to hide just because I took my eyes off her for a second!?  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Well, now I'm just too pissed to give up. You didn't let her get away 'cause you felt bad for her or anything like that, did you?  
  
   
**Medb:**   
How about you, middle child? I bet you're the kind of Goody Two-shoes who goes around putting beached turtles back in the water, aren't you?  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
Th-that's not true. I get just as upset as anyone else. (Well, maybe I did feel a little bad for her...)  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
I agree that letting that Servant run free will do Chaldea no favors. She must be dealt with.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
It does go against my own beliefs to gang up on an opponent...but I am willing to bend the rules in this case. Let us all go after her.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
For that matter, I think the three of us makes for a rather fair fight. Wouldn't you agree, Para?  
  
   
**Paraíso:**   
...Indeed. Our patience has its limits.  
  
   
**Paraíso:**   
She's gone too far. I can no longer overlook her arrogance and foul mouth.  
  
   
**Paraíso:**   
“Oh, sorry, you're so small I didn't see you.”  
“Too bad you weren't born a boy, huh?”  
  
   
**Paraíso:**   
When she said those things to me, I understood what it meant to put on airs. I will not be satisfied until she has been duly punished.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Another interesting assortment, huh...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Quite the rogues' gallery we've got here...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medb:**   
   
Ah! There you are, you overgrown freak! How dare you run away from me before I'm done whipping you!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
What, you're not scared now that you've got a [♂ guy /♀️ friend} backing you up? If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a girl who can't fight her own battles.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
Well said. What sort of tank are you, hiding behind someone else!? You do not see me doing that, do you!?  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
You there! You should know that lady hiding behind you right now is positively overflowing with issues.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
If you truly care for her,  
you should let face her corporal punishment!  
  
   
**Paraíso:**   
Indeed. And by corporal punishment, we of course mean stringing her up. Say the word, and I shall excise her excess padding myself.  
  
   
**Paraíso:**   
One must fight fire with fire, and venom with venom. Long have I bemoaned my serpent's curse, but if it will help me vanquish this foe today, I am grateful.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Oh no! It's...  
It's...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Um...I'm sorry, have we met? None of you are really all that memorable, so I don't recall...  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Oh, she is so dead! I'm usually not that into having other women wait on me, but&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're not?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Really?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medb:**   
Well, not that much!  
But in her case, I don't know...  
  
   
**Medb:**   
There's just something about that woman that makes me want to torment the hell out of her!  
  
   
**Paraíso:**   
Agreed. Like Lady Lip, my karma curses me to bear baseless torture at others' hands...  
  
   
**Paraíso:**   
...and yet, for some reason, I am overcome with the desire to make her bawl her eyes out!  
  
   
**Paraíso:**   
I shall seal away her skills, seal away her Noble Phantasm, and send her off to Paraíso to lose some of that monstrous weight!  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
I wouldn't go that far... All I wish is for her to be more careful with her language. And yet...  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
...every spy bone in my body is calling for me to punish this abomination!  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
What sort of outfit is that anyway!? If you must wear something with a flower motif, at least make it a lily!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I'm sorry, Fujimaru. I don't know why it came to this, but it looks like they want to fight...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Ugh, I hate dealing with weaklings.  
They never know when to give up...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Oh, but don't worry. This might take some time, but I'll end it as quickly as I can. It should be a good way to blow off some steam!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...And now, here we are, making our way to the exit...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
I know how you feel, Master.  
You're exhausted, body and soul...  
  
   
**BB:**   
I'll admit, I underestimated Lip's pheromones.  
Once Medb's group was out of the picture...  
  
   
**BB:**   
...I never thought we'd then run into Gilles (Saber), Anne, Mary, Arjuna, Martha, the lion, the elephant, the sheep...  
  
   
**BB:**   
...Helena, Semiramis, Abby,  
Andersen, Benkei, Caligula...  
  
   
**BB:**   
...Phantom, the pitch black puppy boy,  
Mecha Eli-chan, and the smart Gil...  
  
   
**BB:**   
And from all these other presences I'm sensing, it doesn't look like we're anywhere near out of the woods yet! That's my Alter Ego for you!  
  
   
**BB:**   
As an event planner myself, I do have to give her props for the way she causes chaos wherever she goes!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I'm glad you're happy about this,  
because I'm sure not...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I'm doing my best to bite my tongue so nobody picks on me, but they just keep coming by the truckload.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait. Did all those things actually happen at Chaldea?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Yes. That's all my past trauma coming back to haunt me.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
The real me doesn't remember them very well,  
so the details might be a little off...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...but that's basically how the other Servants always gang up on me. Isn't it awful!?  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
That's what I have to deal with all the time.  
I don't even bother them like BB does...  
  
   
**BB:**   
And, as you can see, she has absolutely nothing in the way of self-awareness.  
  
   
**BB:**   
It's like she doesn't even realize her thoughtless remarks are what sets all these people off!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Still, Lip wouldn't be Lip otherwise...  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Right!? I'm not doing anything wrong!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I'm just carefully choosing my words while making sure to still be honest.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
All I said is that Medb's good looks aren't helping her get any dates, that d'Eon lacks the decisiveness needed to be a good defender...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...and that Paraíso's too all over the place to leave a real impression! Perfectly harmless, right!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think she gets her smiley-prickly nature from you, BB...  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Hey, I'm nothing like BB!  
You take that back, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
BB's prickly smile is obnoxious and sneering,  
while mine is meek and adorable!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
Hmm, I forgot how rough it was seeing an unabashed dark side up close like this. Especially when the girl it belongs to is so clueless.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Even if it is just her second SG ego speaking, there's no way her contracted Master could completely cover for this.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's for sure.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That means a lot, coming from the one who cut her off in the first place.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
Since we're coming up on the endgame here,  
I'm just going to let that one slide.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Fujimaru,  
this is Lip's biggest problem.  
  
   
**BB:**   
This lack of self-awareness, along with the “torment me!” vibe she can't help but radiate, only makes her Masochistic Nature even stronger.  
  
   
**BB:**   
But this is who she is. It's not the kind of thing you can fix in a day. Hell, in her case, it's not the kind of thing she can ever fix.  
  
   
**BB:**   
However, the good news is that her Masochistic Nature doesn't need to be fixed, because it's not a negative.  
  
   
**BB:**   
That's where Lip went wrong: thinking of this SG as something that needed to be hidden or corrected.  
  
   
**BB:**   
As her Master, I hope you can understand and accept that.  
  
   
**BB:**   
If you tell her you don't mind her Masochistic Nature at all, or that you like her just the way she is, it ought to help a lot.  
  
   
**BB:**   
We Alter Egos' Secret Gardens lie beyond the walls we put up in our hearts.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Once you come to know and accept her secrets,  
that's when a Sakura series Alter Ego really shines.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Though of course, as the Sakura series goes,  
Lip and Melt are pretty easy to read.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Lip's skin might be highly sensitive, but she's oblivious when it comes to other people's feelings.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Meltryllis, on the other hand, can barely feel anything on her skin, but she's sharp as a tack about others' feelings.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Aww, you were finally saying something nice about me. Did you really have to bring Melt up now, BB?  
  
   
**BB:**   
Hehehe, I sure did! Thanks to all my babbling, you didn't even notice that we'd reached our destination!  
  
   
**BB:**   
All right, Fujimaru,  
take a look at your next arena!  
  
   
**BB:**   
That...is the last obstacle of this simplified Sakura Labyrinth, as well as its exit!  
  
   
**BB:**   
For our final scene, I called in the strongest Sentinel around to teach Lip a lesson for being so self-centered!  
  
   
**Meltryllis:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's...another Alter Ego!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
And not just her! She's also joined by everyone's favorite mastermind and threat to humanity: BB!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? But you're over here with&ndash;Huh!? Where'd she go!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
Hehehe. You didn't really think I was going to help you out for nothing, did you?  
  
   
**BB:**   
That was all just an act I put on so I could give Lip the lesson she needs.  
  
   
**BB:**   
And you, my little Fujimaru, were nothing more than the carrot meant to lead her to class!  
  
   
**Meltryllis:**   
...Yeah, that's about the size of it. Looks like you've been up to some real nonsense again, Lip.  
  
   
**Meltryllis:**   
Well, you can't get away with this crap forever.  
Our resources are too damn precious to waste like this.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...  
(...I can't believe BB went and called Melt...)  
  
   
**BB:**   
Now then, as I said earlier, Lip's problems aren't the sort of thing you can fix in a day.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Buuut...  
  
   
**BB:**   
Say, for the sake of argument, she witnessed her beloved Master getting killed right in her own mind. Don't you think that would shock her into straightening out her act at least a bit?  
  
   
**BB:**   
Which is why I decided to bring in a professional to finish the job!  
  
   
**BB:**   
There's only so much amateurs like Medb can do to really put the screws to Lip, after all.  
  
   
**BB:**   
But, if Lip's exact opposite, Meltryllis,  
aka the Alter Ego of pleasure...  
  
   
**BB:**   
...aka the Sadist Prima with the Sadistic Streak SG,  
were to carve up Lip's precious Master&ndash;  
  
   
**Meltryllis:**   
Forget it. I'm out of here.  
  
   
**BB:**   
So you're not going to carve [♂ him /♀️ her} up!?  
But this is your once-in-a-lifetime chance to do whatever you want with my approval!  
  
   
**Meltryllis:**   
Are you freaking kidding me? I already do what I want, when I want. I couldn't care less whether you approve.  
  
   
**Meltryllis:**   
And this? I'm not feeling it.  
  
   
**Meltryllis:**   
I do love beating up on people,  
but I've no interest in beating up on myself.  
  
   
**Meltryllis:**   
Besides, isn't being the bad guy more your thing?  
  
   
**Meltryllis:**   
If Chaldea's made any of us lose her touch, “Mother,”  
I'd say it's you for trying to pawn your dirty work off on your own daughter, wouldn't you?  
  
   
**BB:**   
Ouch! I'm going to need skin grafts after that burn!  
  
   
**Meltryllis:**   
All right, Lip, you don't need my grief or my help at this point, so I'm out. Sorry for bothering you.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Melt... Thank you for understanding how I feel...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Fujimaru, I do want to share my secrets with you...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...but I would've sooner died than let her see them.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Is that 'cause you're both trying to push each other as rivals?  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...Right!  
That's exactly the sort of relationship Melt and I have!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...It looked like she just sided with you to piss off BB...  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Yes, that was probably most of it, but there was still some beautiful sisterly love in there!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
(Sigh)... I can't believe the guest of honor canceled on me at the last minute after I went to all this trouble of setting the stage...  
  
   
**BB:**   
It makes me so sad...  
But...  
  
   
**BB:**   
...that doesn't mean she was wrong.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Making a bad situation worse and kicking someone when she's down are what I do best!  
  
   
**BB:**   
Really, now that I think about it, why shouldn't I get to do whatever I want with my own Alter Ego?  
  
   
**BB:**   
I don't need any broken-ass AI who can't even determine her own effectiveness worth a damn. So I'll just melt you down, Master and all.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Lip will be off to the scrap heap, and Fujimaru will finally come to an ignominious end.  
  
   
**BB:**   
What, you think that's a bit extreme?  
Well of course it is.  
  
   
**BB:**   
I do like teasing humanity,  
but I love tormenting myself even more♡  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Hmph! If you think I'm going to let Fujimaru die for that (completely sensible) reason, you've got another thing coming!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Besides, now I'm REALLY mad!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I can forgive a lot of things,  
but bringing Melt here was a bridge too far!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
You handle the orders please, Master!  
Let's teach BB a lesson ourselves!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**BB:**   
Juuust kidding! Did you really think you could get rid of me that easily?  
  
   
**BB:**   
I can do anything in digital worlds,  
including cheating to give myself infinite lives.  
  
   
**BB:**   
I swear, you really are a useless Sakura if you didn't even realize that.  
  
   
**BB:**   
The only way to purge me from a digital space is to trash the process for the entire zone.  
  
   
**BB:**   
That pitiful performance won't help you escape.  
Now face your punishment for defying your god.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Ah...! Ghh...! I can't... I really don't think I can take any more of this...!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Get out of here, Lip!  
   
**Passionlip:**   
But...if I run away now...BB really will kill you...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
She always follows through on whatever she says,  
even if she's only playing around...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I have to stop her now...  
But, I don't know if I&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Stop it, BB!  
   
**BB:**   
Sorry, I'm already running my self-maintenance routine. No more external commands, especially not from humans!  
  
   
**BB:**   
I'll decide what to do with you once I've finished processing Passionlip. Now sit down and shut up.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
A-ahhh...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I knew it.  
I knew I could never be as badass as Melt...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
All I can do is...sit here and suffer...  
I'm weak... Useless...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
(Huff...huff...huff...)  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...Although, that's strange...  
Even though it hurts like hell...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...it also feels like...I'm bursting with power...?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Something seems off about this.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Spartacus?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
That's it!  
  
   
**BB:**   
That's your true power, SG2! The power Lip's been repressing to keep up her good girl act!  
  
   
**BB:**   
It's completely absurd that you've been keeping that under wraps!  
  
   
**BB:**   
You have to fall before you can stand! You gotta be losing before you can turn things around!  
  
   
**BB:**   
You must build up some emotion when you're being tormented! Now's the time to unleash it! Physically!  
  
   
**BB:**   
The way I see it, your greatest strength&ndash;or, put another way, your most terrifying attribute&ndash;is your ability to turn pain into power!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I...see?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
P-please don't say things like that in front of Master!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Stupid, stupid, stupid BB!  
Brynhild Romantiaaa!  
  
   
**BB:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**BB:**   
Oh, shit! I'm glad this went the way I wanted,  
but I wasn't expecting to take it head ooon!!!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well...that was a thing that happened.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And now, evil has been vanquished.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**BB:**   
Oogh... That Romantia was powerful enough to bust up this whole zone...  
  
   
**BB:**   
But hey, at least you get it now, right?  
Masochistic Nature isn't just about enduring pain.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Your true power is in the explosive force that comes from enduring that pain. You can't keep that hidden away from yourself.  
  
   
**BB:**   
After all, you were never going to be a better heroine than me by trying to be a teacher's pet.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Your denseness is what makes you, you, so I hope you stay that way forever. That's all I've got to say.  
  
   
**BB:**   
Oh, and don't worry about Fujimaru.  
[♂ He'll /♀️ She'll} get booted back to Reality Space in a minute or two.  
  
   
**BB:**   
The real you just succeeded at salvaging [♂ him /♀️ her} from your scrap heap.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't you want to thank her or something, Lip?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Hmph. No way I'm thanking her.  
I would've solved this problem all on my...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...No, I guess I couldn't have solved it all on my own.  
Not to mention I ended up having some of my more embarrassing parts exposed.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Still... I guess she was right.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I can't force myself to be someone I'm not.  
Especially if it only makes trouble for you...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I'm so sorry, Fujimaru, but this is who I am.  
Pessimistic, dishonest, heavy, troublesome...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
So...will you scold me when I'm misbehaving?  
Will you still be my Master, even with all my faults?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You have to ask?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Of course.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...Hehe.  
Then I guess I'd better not let you down!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Please take good care of my real self.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
We may still have a lot to learn, but I promise we'll work as hard as we can to catch up to everyone else!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
So, until we do...I hope you'll hold my hand.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
As long as you're by my side,  
I think I can find a way to change who I am...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Oh, thank goodness!  
I'm so glad I managed to salvage you!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Are you hurt? Are you injured?  
Are you feeling all right!?  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
You are okay, right!? Yes?  
Oh, thank goodness. What a relief...!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...Once again, I'm so sorry, Fujimaru...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
It's all my fault you were almost trashed and crushed...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I guess you must really hate me now. Who'd want to keep around someone who dropped them into a garbage dump...?  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
But don't worry.  
I'll stay away from you from now on...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I'll just hide in one of Chaldea's corners and live out the rest of my materialization as a Rogue Servant, doing what I can to help from the shadows...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There's no need for that.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It was actually really pleasant in there.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
R-really!? I don't know all that much about my body,  
so I thought...you must have hated it in there!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
But...I can tell you're not lying.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
You must have been through a lot,  
since I asked BB to help you...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
...but you're still holding my hand...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
And on top of that, I'm feeling great.  
It's all thanks to you, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I bet I could take on anyone right now.  
...Would you like to go to the simulator and see?  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I'm really feeling pumped up for some reason.  
I wonder why!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fine with me, but what do we do for an opponent?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Don't worry, I've got that covered!  
I know plenty of other Servants who'd be willing to fight!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
There's Medb, d'Eon, Paraíso, Hijikata...  
And I'm sure there'd be lots of others if I asked!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Hehe. I'm sure I'll end up losing in the end, but that'll be fun, too.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Okay, let's go, Master.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I'm going to make you proud to have me as a Servant!
