# Asclepius  
  
## Memory of Medicine  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Are you there, Leonardo da Vinci?  
I need to talk to you.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, hey, Asclepius. We almost never see you here in the Command Room. What's up?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hey there!  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Oh, you're here too, Master?  
Perfect.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is somebody here not feeling well or something?  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Oho. I appreciate your keeping an eye out for clinical trial opportunities to help me further my medical research, Master.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
But no, I'm here about a different matter today,  
since there doesn't seem to be anyone here who I could call my patient.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Indeed, everyone here seems to be perfectly healthy, unfortunately.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
You never change, do you?  
...So what's up?  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
It's about the infirmary.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I appreciate the permission to use it, but I'm afraid it's a little hard to use efficiently as it is now.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Would you mind if I restructured it?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
What do you mean, “restructure”?  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I mean I'd like to reorganize the medicine cabinets  
and change the instrument layout.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
If it were my room alone, I'd have already done so, but as I'm technically renting it, I thought it right to ask.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Ah, okay. Hmm...  
Yeah, sure, I don't see why not.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Besides, I'm sure you'll be using it more than anyone now that you'll be handling the medical treatments around here.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
We're all counting on your expertise,  
Mr. Greek God of Medicine.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks a bunch for coming here.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What she said!  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Hmph. I need as many cases to study as possible if I'm going to advance my research as far as it can go.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
And being here should let me do that. It's a simple matter of you scratch my back, I scratch yours.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
There's no need to thank me,  
or even to expect much from me.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Hehe... I can't wait to try some cutting-edge therapies I've been thinking about on the patients about to come my way!  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Don't worry, I guarantee you their maladies will be cured. I can't assure anything else besides that, though.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, we know your medical skills are top-notch,  
so I'm not worried about that...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I just wish you would do something about your more mad scientisty tendencies...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Said the brilliant inventor whose genius literally can't be measured...)  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Oh, and one more thing.  
I also wanted to ask you about the old exam records.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Given the obvious gaps, there must be more besides the ones kept in the infirmary, no?  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I'm guessing the missing records are those of Servants that have been summoned here, not Chaldea staff.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
For Servants, I imagine you recorded things like what sort of symptoms they showed, and what spiritual measures were taken to treat them.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Those medical techniques may be limited in scope, but they could still be of use when it comes to progressing human medicine.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
So as someone dedicated to advancing the science of medicine, I need to know what they are.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...Hmm.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Were those gaps in the data left there intentionally?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
It's more that I just haven't transcribed that data yet, either on paper or digitally, for various reasons.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I did manage to bring it with  
me when we escaped from Chaldea.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
But then, once we'd made it here to the Wandering Sea and had a chance to catch our breath...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...I just didn't feel right about leaving files containing such data in the new infirmary.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Then one thing led to another, as it so often does around here, and I just kind of ended up leaving it where it was.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
So then, it does exist, but it's being kept somewhere else? Why?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Nnn... Well, basically, it all comes down to privacy.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I mean, medical history, especially anything to do with mental health, is obviously closely tied to a Servant's past, trauma, and major life events, right?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
It's one thing if it's basically public knowledge, but sometimes, there are things that were lost to the history books. Things in a Servant's past that they want to keep absolutely private.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Something so painful they could wind up flying off the handle and try to kill whoever found out. Even Master.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
True, that has happened before...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hey, I can't help that my dreams are so weird.  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...And that's not all.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Exam records like that don't just reveal things about the patients, but about the doctor who examined them, too.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
In this case...the former head of the infirmary.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Your predecessor, basically.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Yes, I know someone else used to hold my position.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I've heard some stories about him, and I've also seen records attesting as much in the infirmary.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Sure, that kind of surface-level information is fine, since it can't cause anyone any harm.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
But once it was clear to my previous self that she was going to have to leave the old Chaldea...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...I think she must have thought a lot over how much of his data to include in the report to the Association.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
And the data she archived while she was thinking about what to do is the exam data you're looking for.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Hmm. So, to summarize:  
  
**Asclepius:**   
The old exam data on the Servants includes sensitive information about both those Servants and the former head of the infirmary who treated them.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
And that's why you don't keep it in the infirmary.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
But be that as it may, I still need that data. And it's not like I want it out of mere curiosity or nosiness.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
The information past doctors recorded about their patients is the most valuable information a new doctor treating those patients can have.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
It will help future exams go more smoothly and enable me to develop or refine more treatments. I need to be able to access it.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Where can I find it?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, it was split up into magecraft fragments...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...that were then attached to other Servants who were using the infirmary to treat patients before you.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
But don't worry, it shouldn't be hard to restore.  
All you have to do is ask them for access.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
That said, you're still pretty new here, and I'm sure there's still plenty of Servants you haven't met yet...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...so it might be a good idea  
if Fujimaru went with you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just what I had in mind.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I got this!  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I can't imagine why I would need Master's protection only to ask for access.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey, you never know.  
It might be a lot more challenging than you think.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
You might not be the new infirmary head, but you're definitely looking to be its star player, so to speak.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
And the other Servants might not appreciate someone new horning in on their territory.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
So don't think they'll sign off on you that easily just because you're a famous god of medicine.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They're all good people, but they can also be...stubborn.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If you end up butting heads, I'll jump in and smooth things over...I hope.  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I see. In that case, it may indeed be worthwhile to have Master come along.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
However, doing one's part to advance medicine is a duty, not a privilege.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Anyone who would refuse it is a foolish patient, devoid of imagination, even if they happen to work in medicine themselves.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
So if any of these Servants should ignore my words or Master's, or otherwise remain uncooperative...  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...I will consider them to be interfering with the advance of medicine, and eliminate them accordingly. I trust that's all right with you?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not really, but we may as well get going anyway.  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Wait. There's one more important thing I need to ask about. Which Servants have the data?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, whoops, sorry.  
It was so long ago that I'm kind of fuzzy on who.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
But I do know they were all Servants who've used the infirmary themselves, so that narrows it down a lot.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Just let Fujimaru lead the way,  
and I'm sure you'll be able to track them all down.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Come on then, let's start looking.  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
All right then, lead the way please, Master.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Though you know, I can't believe you forgot exactly where you were keeping such crucial data. You should know medical records deserve much more respect than that.  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Asclepius:**   
All that being said, it's true that I'm still not used to this place, so it would have been difficult to find these other Servants on my own.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
So I suppose that's one more reason why I should be grateful that you're accompanying me.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I might know this place better than you, but it's still a big place.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're welcome, but we may still have to ask around quite a bit.  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Not a problem. We can start by talking to everyone we come across. I'm used to asking people questions thanks to the many consultations I've performed.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Hmm, here comes someone now. Perfect timing.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
.........  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's Paris. Let's go say hi!  
  
**Paris:**   
Oh, hello, Master.  
Are you taking a walk?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hold it right there, short stuff.  
  
**Paris:**   
Heeey... I'm still a growing boy!  
  
**Paris:**   
Anyway, how are you today, Master?  
I'm doing great, myself!  
  
---  
  
**Paris:**   
And who are...  
Um...  
  
**Asclepius:**   
.........  
  
**Paris:**   
...Huh? What is it, Lord Apollo?  
It's not like you to whisper.  
  
**Paris:**   
Uh-huh, uh-huh... What?  
You're not going to move or say anything here?  
  
**Paris:**   
You want me to just think of you as a stuffed animal because of reasons?  
  
**Paris:**   
But why? Does it have anything to do with that man standing there with his mouth agape?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Oh, right. Apollo and Asclepius have some, um, history, don't they...)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Did something happen between Apollo and Asclepius at one point?)  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...That smell. It reeks in here.  
  
**Paris:**   
N-no it doesn't! Everyone always compliments me on how much I smell like soap!  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Oh yes it does. It reeks of Divinity. It reeks of a selfish, narrow-minded, loathsome excuse for a Greek god!  
  
**Paris:**   
A god...? Are you talking about Lord Apollo?  
  
**Paris:**   
But he's so soft, and fluffy, and I always thought he smelled like sunshine...  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Apollo? Then, that sheep...  
I knew it.  
  
**Paris:**   
Ahh! Thief! Lord Apollo thief!  
Give him baaack!  
  
**Asclepius:**   
......  
  
**Apollo:**   
......  
  
**Paris:**   
I can't believe you just threw Lord Apollo away like a piece of garbage! How could you do such a thing!?  
  
**Paris:**   
Hmph... Oh no! Lord A-Apollo, your fluffy wool soaked up all that trash like a sponge...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh!? Why did you change your outfit!?  
  
---  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
Don't worry, I'm not contagious.  
I just didn't want to deal with that stink anymore.  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
That...thing is just a terminal. But even so, I don't want to be in the same room as it, let alone breathe the same air.  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
To be blunt, I hate that thing,  
and I demand you keep it far away from me.  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
I don't even want to look at it, as I might end up crushing it unconsciously.  
  
**Paris:**   
Whaaat? How can you be so mean?  
  
**Artemis:**   
Oh, I don't know if you can blame him. Apollo does like humans, but that also means he makes more trouble for them.  
  
**Orion:**   
Yup, yup. You know that expression about knowing just enough to be dangerous? It's like, three times worse when you're talking about a god knowing just enough about humans.  
  
**Paris:**   
Lady Artemis!  
  
**Artemis:**   
Hi, Paris! Nice to see you too,  
my poor, grumpy nephew Asclepius.  
  
**Orion:**   
Heya. I'm the cute Orion.  
So you're Asclepius, huh?  
  
**H：Orion:**   
I heard Artemis here went a little wild after I died.  
  
**H：Orion:**   
I might not've done anything directly myself,  
but I'm sorry for the trouble, anyway.  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
...It was always a dream of mine to fully bring the dead back to life.  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
So I'm sure that cowardly god would have struck me with lightning sooner or later, even without your involvement.  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
The only grudge I hold is towards him and his detestable narrow-mindedness.  
  
**Artemis:**   
Hmm... The gods of Olympus don't usually go around doing things that aren't in their spec sheets...  
  
**Artemis:**   
Well, I do, but I don't count, since that side of me is fundamentally broken!  
  
**Artemis:**   
Anyway, I overheard Apollo's name and couldn't help but poke my nose in. What're you guys talking about?  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
We weren't talking. I was just demanding that loathsome terminal be taken somewhere I don't have to see it.  
  
**Artemis:**   
Gosh, really? Even though Apollo's just being a cute, harmless, animal-type terminal for once?  
  
**Orion:**   
(Then, that means...I can beat him this time!)  
  
**Orion:**   
Hmm? So that cute little thing is Apollo? The same god that tricked Artemis and got me killed? I see...  
  
**Apollo:**   
......  
  
**Paris:**   
(Oh, Lord Apollo... You're going to ride out running into Lady Artemis and Orion by pretending to just be a stuffed animal here, too, aren't you!?)  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
Hmph. Never mind that thing.  
It's not even close to the main unit.  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
There's no point in being overly sensitive about a terminal that can't even talk. It's just bad for my mental health.  
  
**Artemis:**   
...Can't even talk, huh?  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
That said, it may be a good thing that I happened to run into you here, Aunt Arte&ndash;  
  
**Artemis:**   
Stooop! Don't you dare call me “aunt”!  
  
**Artemis:**   
It just sounds so...old! You should know not to call people names when you know it bothers them!  
  
**Artemis:**   
Now come on. We are technically family, so we should try to get along. Isn't that what humans do with families?  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
Hmph. Family or not, you're still a god. I have no wish to talk to you more than strictly necessary.  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
You know that just as well as I do.  
Don't you, Aunt Ar&ndash;  
  
**Artemis:**   
Stop it!  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
Hehe. Usually, I would be looking for a way to perfect my resurrection elixir, but today, I'm trying to find certain Servants of interest.  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
If you help me, I'll refrain  
from calling you the “a” word.  
  
**Artemis:**   
Gnn. That just sounds like a threat to me...  
  
**Artemis:**   
But, okay. Kind big sister Artemis just can't help but spoil her niblings.  
  
**Artemis:**   
So, who are you looking for?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you for helping us, O Goddess.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well, we're looking for...  
  
---  
  
**Artemis:**   
Got it.  
Godly powers, activaaate.  
  
**Orion:**   
Wow, chintzy much?  
  
**Artemis:**   
Okay, you'll find him over there.  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
Understood. Thank you, um... Oh, right.  
“Thank you, sweet and beautiful big sister Artemis.”  
  
**Artemis:**   
Aww, you remembered what you're supposed to say when I've done you a favor! That was wonderful!  
  
**Orion:**   
You think?  
It sure didn't sound like his heart was in it to me...  
  
**Artemis:**   
This sort of thing is why I just can't help bestowing my power on you, even when you're trying to break the rules and make a resurrection elixir.  
  
**Orion:**   
You ever think you're kind of a pushover when it comes to family? Isn't that the kind of thing that led to Zeus killing him?  
  
**D：Asclepius:**   
Now that I know where to look, I don't need to stick around dealing with gods anymore. Let's go, Master.  
  
**Artemis:**   
'Kay! See you later!  
  
**Orion:**   
See you, pal! Let's hang out sometime just the two of us. I got a feeling having you around is really gonna improve my hit-on rate.  
  
**Artemis:**   
What was that about a hit-on rate, Darling?  
Are you hitting on other girls again?  
  
**Orion:**   
Crap!  
  
**Artemis:**   
Say, Paris, that stuffed sheep of yours looks pretty dirty. Maybe you should throw it in the washer?  
  
**Artemis:**   
Yeah, I think that would be a great idea, divinely speaking. We could even throw Darling in with him.  
  
**Artemis:**   
Let's set the timer dial to “Eternity” to make sure his mind stays niiice and clean.  
  
**Paris:**   
Wait. Huh?  
  
**Orion:**   
Oh gods, please don't punish us together!  
Do you have any idea how awkward that'd be!?  
  
**Orion:**   
Look! Now you've got that innocent little boy all confused 'cause he can't tell if you're joking!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They're certainly a spirited bunch, aren't they?  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
That's one way to put it. There are far too many Greek Divinities here for my liking. I can only hope this place never gets any more.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
But, that has nothing to do with my work here.  
Don't worry, I'll make sure to do my job well.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I'll even treat that little brat to the best of my ability if he should ever come to me for medical assistance.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I promise you, I won't go easy on him in the slightest.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
In other words, you don't discriminate between patients, huh?  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Of course not. Though naturally, I WILL smash that Apollo terminal into the nearest trash can first. That part is nonnegotiable.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Anyway, this should be the place...  
  
**Sanson:**   
Oh, hello, Master.  
And you are...?  
  
**Asclepius:**   
My name's Asclepius.  
I need to ask you something.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You see...  
  
---  
  
**Sanson:**   
Aha... Now I understand.  
  
**Sanson:**   
Yes, I do have some of the old exam  
data pertaining to his records.  
  
**Sanson:**   
Truth be told, I wondered if I was fit to hold onto it.  
  
**Sanson:**   
Still, while I may not have had the relationship with him that Master did...  
  
**Sanson:**   
...as one of the “old guard” here,  
I did still know him for a fairly long time.  
  
**Sanson:**   
So since it was only a fragment of the data,  
I agreed to hold onto it temporarily.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Answer me this:  
Are you a doctor?  
  
**Sanson:**   
...No, I can't say that I am.  
  
**Sanson:**   
I did work in the infirmary helping him out as needed, but I am not a doctor by any means.  
  
**Sanson:**   
In the end, I'm just an executioner. I used my hands to end lives much more than I did to save them.  
  
**Sanson:**   
The only medical knowledge I have came about as a kind of side effect from working in executions. It can't compare to that of a real doctor.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Hmph. So you say there's worthy medical knowledge and not worthy medical knowledge?  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Medicine is medicine. All that matters is whether it’s useful, and whether it can cure people or not.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
The truth is, the more death you've seen,  
the better you can keep others from dying.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I've seen far more people die than a typical executioner. In fact, that's what made me want to overcome death.  
  
**Sanson:**   
...I see.  
  
**Sanson:**   
It would seem you truly are the avatar of doctors everywhere, Asclepius, God of Medicine.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
It may not matter how later generations speak of me, but I can't say I like being called a god.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
In the end, I'm just a doctor who wants to do what he can to develop medicine further. That's all I need.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...So?  
Will you let me see the old exam data you possess?  
  
**Sanson:**   
...  
  
**Sanson:**   
Let me ask a question of my own first.  
What do you think, Master?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I hope you'll let him see it, but it's up to you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think you should do whatever you think is right, Sanson.  
  
---  
  
**Sanson:**   
I see. In that case...  
  
**Sanson:**   
...there's one thing I'd like to resolve first.  
  
**Sanson:**   
If I simply hand this data over now, it would mean giving it up for nothing more than one doctor's convictions.  
  
**Sanson:**   
And that's just not quite enough for something this valuable.  
  
**Sanson:**   
So I'd like to see your skill for myself, Asclepius.  
  
**Sanson:**   
Please, show me why you are the right person to take this off my hands.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Hmm. So you want to see my skill at treating patients and performing operations, do you?  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Fine with me.  
But I insist you show me your skill in return.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
No matter how good a doctor you may be, there will always be times when you can't handle everything on your own.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
If you have what it takes to assist me,  
you'll always be welcome in my infirmary!  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Well, well, not bad at all. You really have seen much more death in your time than most.  
  
**Sanson:**   
You are too kind. Seeing your techniques from the time when gods still walked the Earth was eye-opening.  
  
**Sanson:**   
There were many aspects to it I couldn't understand, but I could still tell that it was the result of all the hard work you devoted to truly mastering medicine.  
  
**Sanson:**   
All right, I'm convinced.  
I think I can trust you not to misuse this data.  
  
**Sanson:**   
That said...I'm not entirely sure  
you'll be able to understand it.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
?  
  
**Sanson:**   
But never mind that. A promise is a promise. Here you are. It's all compressed, so it won't take long at all.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Hm?  
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;.  
.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Asclepius?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you okay?  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Yes...I'm fine. And this does indeed appear to be part of the exam data I've been looking for.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
It also contained information on the man who led Chaldea's medical division...  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...back when it had been completely isolated from the world, and humanity at large, during the Incineration of Humanity incident.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I also saw what this doctor did back then.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
How he saw patients, how he examined them,  
how he interacted with them...  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Albeit only in partial, fragmented form.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So...what did you think? Any impressions?  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
About the former head doctor, you mean?  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Well, in a word...  
I would say he was a perfectly ordinary man.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
He did all he could handling problems as they arose, and to head them off before they worsened.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
He did his best as a mere human to handle the events happening around him, and to care for the patients they generated.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
That's not something just anyone can do,  
and he should be commended for that. Still...  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...  
No, never mind.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
There are all sorts of doctors, after all.  
It's not my place to say anything more.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
True, he was definitely a very different kind of doctor than you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah... He was just a regular guy. And a strong doctor.  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I see. At any rate, this data alone won't be enough to give me the full picture.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Let's look for another Servant  
who's likely to have a piece.  
  
**Sanson:**   
Who are you planning to see next?  
  
**Sanson:**   
...I see.  
  
**Sanson:**   
I can't be sure about anyone other than myself,  
but that does sound right to me.  
  
**Sanson:**   
Unfortunately, I'm afraid I don't know where they could be right now. I'm sorry I can't be of more help.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's okay. We'll just look around until we find them.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No problem. Thanks for everything!  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
(Although...it seems the last head doctor didn't care about advancing medicine.)  
  
**Asclepius:**   
(It was as though he had no interest whatsoever in pushing the medical arts forward, or in helping them to evolve.)  
  
**Asclepius:**   
(From what I saw, it looked like he had his hands completely full taking care of day-to-day affairs.)  
  
**Asclepius:**   
(He and I may both be doctors, but our goals are very different. I can't help but find that disappointing.)  
  
**Asclepius:**   
(I do still need the old data, but I'll have to lower my hopes about finding anything else useful for my progress out of it...)  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There's a trick to finding this next person.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This next person always shows up on their own in certain situations.  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Hmm. So that's why we've come here,  
to where many people gather.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Be careful. It would be all too easy for infectious disease to spread in such a place, where a number of people are always coming and going.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
On a different note, I was expecting to hear people chattering here, but it's much noisier than I thought it would be. Some of those voices sound familiar, too.  
  
**Jason:**   
...And then, just when things seemed completely hopeless, I stood my ground firmly and said:  
  
**Jason:**   
“I'll face you head-on! I won't run or hide,  
so just bring it on, you cretins!”  
  
**Jason:**   
Right to their faces!  
  
**Atalante:**   
I see you still have no idea when to shut up. Stop regaling me with tales of adventure I never asked to hear. It is ruining my meal.  
  
**Atalante:**   
Besides, it was not you doing the fighting in that story. It was Heracles, right? If you are going to tell a story, then tell it right.  
  
**Jason:**   
Heh. I don't expect feebleminded felines to understand this, but that's a storytelling technique called “playing up dramatic tension.”  
  
**Atalante:**   
Hey, you used to teach him as well, correct? Get him to shut up. Or better yet, make him redo his training, starting from year one.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Hahaha, that's quite the tall order. Though I might just add him to the graduation test for my students.  
  
**Jason:**   
So I'd be the great hero standing in your inferior-compared-to-me students' way as the last major obstacle they need to overcome before they can graduate, huh? I could get on board with that.  
  
**Atalante:**   
Good grief. You always were a blowhard, but it seems like you have gotten even worse since you came here.  
  
**Atalante:**   
...Hm? That smell...  
  
**Asclepius:**   
It's been a long time since I've seen all of you gathered together like this.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Do any of you have a rare or unprecedented disease to show me to commemorate our reunion? No? Hmph, figures.  
  
**Jason:**   
No way! Asclepius! I haven't seen you since you were serving as the famed ship doctor of my Argo! How've you been, you old son of a god!?  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Still as healthy as ever, unfortunately.  
I'm sorry to see you doing well too, Jason.  
  
**Jason:**   
Ah yes, that's the Asclepius I remember.  
Hahaha, I'm so glad you're here!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He really does look genuinely happy about this...  
  
---  
  
**Atalante:**   
(Munch, munch) Do not let him fool you, Master.  
His joy has nothing to do with seeing an old friend.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Oh, I'm sure that's part of it.  
...At least to some degree.  
  
**Jason:**   
Excellent! Now my odds of surviving no matter what happens have gone way up!  
  
**Jason:**   
You're one of the Argonauts, after all,  
so I basically own you.  
  
**Jason:**   
And as an Argonaut, it's your duty to heal me, the captain of the Argo, before healing anyone else, right?  
  
**Jason:**   
Okay, I'll go ahead and draw up a contract that declares you my exclusive doctor, just like before.  
  
**Jason:**   
Naturally, that means you won't have to bother doling out meds or treating any other patients besides me.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I have no interest in being your exclusive doctor, Jason. That's just as true now as it ever was.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Besides, you're too damn healthy, anyway. Why can't you be more reckless and come back with an interesting injury or disease now and then?  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I'd be happy to take a look at you if you fought a rare Demonic Beast and got a severe injury like Heracles or Theseus's...  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...but the only malady you ever came down with was an upset stomach caused by eating rotten food.  
  
**Atalante:**   
What did you expect? He is the kind of man who is happy to let others face danger while he hides away in safety.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
What about you, Atalante? You seem much more likely than Jason to provide me with an interesting new case study. Do you have any conditions you'd like me to exam&ndash;  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Hold it. Since when do you have cat ears and a tail?  
I don't remember you having those on the Argo.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Fascinating.  
Now those are definitely something worth examining...  
  
**Atalante:**   
Hey! Do not creep up on me like that, especially when I am eating. If you try touching my ears or tail without asking, I will kill you where you stand.  
  
**Atalante:**   
You may be a great doctor, but you are downright inhuman when it comes to anything not related to medicine. It is long past time you were aware of that.  
  
**Chiron:**   
I did teach him about things besides medicine, but it seems like they didn't take. I'm so sorry...  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Teacher. I didn't know you were here, too.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
If you ever get any strange or unusual patients, please be sure to send them my way. I won't be sending any to you, though.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Hehe, you haven't changed a bit, have you?  
I'm actually relieved to see that.  
  
**Chiron:**   
By the way, Master, you should know that Jason is quite serious. Perhaps you'd like to say something?  
  
**Jason:**   
Great. Now I just have to get a scroll inscribed with a spell of binding for the contract and make him sign&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hold it. No exclusive doctor contracts while I'm around.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
To sign a contract, you'll have to run it by me first.  
  
---  
  
**Jason:**   
You're here too, Master? Dammit.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Even if [♂ he /♀️ she] wasn't, I already told you I'm not  
interested in being your exclusive doctor.  
Try to listen for once.  
  
**Jason:**   
(Oh well, at least he's aware I'm here now. That's got to make a big difference, even without a contract.)  
  
**Jason:**   
(No matter how obsessed with medicine he is, he's still got to feel SOME gratitude towards the man who lead the Argonauts, namely me.)  
  
**Jason:**   
(...Right! Right?)  
  
**Jason:**   
(...On second thought, maybe I'd better just make sure I stick close to him if anything bad goes down...)  
  
**Jason:**   
Anyway, Master, I'm sure you didn't come here just to hold an Argonauts reunion. What do you want?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well...  
  
---  
  
**Jason:**   
Hmm, an infirmary, huh. Personally, I'd rather you open one on my ship before you open one here.  
  
**Jason:**   
In fact, now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure he still belongs to me! Where do you get off letting everyone else take advantage of him!?  
  
**Atalante:**   
Where did you get the idea he was your sole property?  
Ugh, I swear...  
  
**Atalante:**   
Do not worry about Jason, Master.  
Asclepius's medicinal skills are the genuine article.  
  
**Atalante:**   
If you can get him to cooperate, and you should,  
they would benefit everyone at Chaldea.  
  
**Atalante:**   
However, his personality is just as horrible as Jason's, albeit in a very different way.  
  
**Atalante:**   
There is no telling what sort of trouble he may cause others if it means furthering his medical research.  
  
**Jason:**   
Hey, you never ate your dessert. Well, that's just bad manners. Here, I'll take care of it for you. (Yoink)  
  
**Atalante:**   
Ahhhhhh!  
  
**Atalante:**   
What do you think you are doing!?  
I was saving that for last, so I could savor it!  
  
**Jason:**   
Nah, I don't buy it. You just changed your mind and decided you wanted it after all once you saw me enjoying it.  
  
**Jason:**   
But I can't blame you; it was reaaally good. Mmm, I can still taste its deliciousness lingering on my tongue... Man, I feel real bad for anyone who didn't get to enjoy that scrumptious treat themself.  
  
**Atalante:**   
You bastaaard!  
  
**Jason:**   
Gurk! M-my neck...! Oh crap! This is the same  
hold you used to beat Peleus, isn't it!?  
  
**Jason:**   
H-help! She's seriously gonna kill me!  
Save me, Asclepius!  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...Hmm, these injuries are still too ordinary to interest me. I don't suppose you could twist his neck around a little more...ostentatiously, could you?  
  
**Atalante:**   
Ask, and ye shall receive!  
  
**E：???:**  
Hold it right there!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hey, that's the person we were looking for.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There she is! Talk about a happy accident!  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale:**   
You there. You are a doctor, are you not?  
Why aren't you doing anything to help?  
  
**Nightingale:**   
Just look at his face.  
It's obvious that cyanosis is starting to set in.  
  
**Nightingale:**   
I don't know what sort of treatment you're employing here, but you can't treat a patient once they're dead.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Don't worry. He's not going to die.  
  
**Jason:**   
I beg to differ!  
  
**Atalante:**   
It is all right, Nightingale. His foolishness caused this condition, and death is the only thing that will cure it.  
  
**Nightingale:**   
...I see. If death is what he needs to be healthy again, then that's what I'll have to administer.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's a Berserker, so...yeah.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't think about it too hard. Trust me.  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
All right. I won't pretend to understand, but it makes sense that medicine would differ across time and regions.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I'll need to experience as much of it as I can if I'm to advance medicine as a whole, and the best way to understand it is to try it myself.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Besides, I can't back down now. Not when it seems as though she's also carrying a fragment of the exam data I'm looking for.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Very well then, we can both demonstrate our technique,  
using Jason as a test subject.  
  
**Jason:**   
...! (Trying and failing to say  
“But I don't want to be a test subject!”)  
  
**Asclepius:**   
You'll help too, right, Teacher?  
Since you're here and all.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Well now. I've heard of being resourceful,  
but this is on quite another level.  
  
**Chiron:**   
You really don't have any sense of restraint when it comes to anything other than medicine, do you?  
  
**Chiron:**   
But I don't mean that in a bad way. If anything, I find it refreshing how unabashedly straightforward you are.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Very well, I'm in.  
I can't wait to see how much you've grown.  
  
**Nightingale:**   
I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  
  
**Nightingale:**   
As a doctor, you should be more thorough than anyone when it comes to disinfecting. Cutting corners is not acceptable.  
  
**Nightingale:**   
I will do whatever it takes to ensure everything around me is as perfectly sterilized as possible!  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Atalante:**   
...Hmph.  
  
**Atalante:**   
I do not see why we had to hold back that much,  
seeing how both Nightingale and Asclepius are here.  
  
**Atalante:**   
We could have easily made him nearly dead instead of just half dead. I will have to do that next time...  
  
**Nightingale:**   
Now I see.  
You weren't abandoning your medical duties after all.  
  
**Nightingale:**   
By observing his symptoms as they worsened over time, you were able to find a better method to treat his condition, right?  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I'm glad you understand my methods now, nurse. And I must say, your remarks about sanitization were fascinating, too.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
The concepts of sterilization and nursing may not serve to further the field of medicine, but they do serve to expand it.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Indeed, taking the entire environment in which patients are treated into consideration, where a doctor is only one part of the whole, may well be the foundation that leads to new advances in medicine.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
After all, one does need a strong foundation  
in order to avoid tapering off.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
That said...  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I still don't understand why your sanitization methods involve guns and fists, let alone throwing beds...  
  
**Asclepius:**   
But I suspect that's because I'm an ancient Heroic Spirit, and you're a very new one.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I can only hope that my studies here  
at Chaldea help to remedy that...  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...even if the knowledge I gain is limited to the version of me that has been summoned here.  
  
**Nightingale:**   
Now, what was it you wished to talk to me about?  
The old exam data, was it?  
  
**Nightingale:**   
Yes, a part of it is in my custody.  
  
**Nightingale:**   
If you wish, Master, and if it will help to improve the infirmary, the last bastion for Chaldea's patients...  
  
**Nightingale:**   
...then I am happy to share it with this new doctor, now that I've seen how sound his technique is.  
  
**Nightingale:**   
Here you are.  
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;.  
.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...Hmm.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
(It seems the last head doctor had relationships with many people; much more than his profession alone would cultivate. Frankly speaking, he was well-liked and popular.)  
  
**Asclepius:**   
(In that sense, it seems like he may have embodied the concepts this nurse was advocating.)  
  
**Asclepius:**   
(He was acting not just as a doctor but more like the oil that kept everything around him running smoothly. He didn't just treat individual patients.)  
  
**Asclepius:**   
(He treated all of Chaldea, Master and Servants alike, as a single organism...)  
  
**Asclepius:**   
(No... It seems he treated all of humanity, even as it was on the verge of being incinerated.)  
  
**Asclepius:**   
(That is...quite the accomplish&ndash;)  
  
**Asclepius:**   
(No, not yet. It's still obvious that he and I have very different stances on medicine.)  
  
**Asclepius:**   
(He all but abandoned his duty to push medicine forward. That's the one thing I can't endorse...)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did it work?  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...Yes, I got what I wanted. Everything is fine.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Let's see... The next Servant I can think of who might use the infirmary...  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I don't suppose it's you, is it, Teacher?  
  
**Chiron:**   
No, I'm afraid not.  
  
**Chiron:**   
I actually came much later than Ms. Nightingale did, so I never met the last head of the infirmary either.  
  
**Chiron:**   
As such, holding on to records of him is not something I would be comfortable taking responsibility for.  
  
**Chiron:**   
No, I think there's someone else out there holding on to that data. Someone better suited to do so than me.  
  
**Chiron:**   
In fact...I suspect you may already have some idea of who they might be, Master.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't know. Nobody comes to mind...  
  
**Chiron:**   
Try to put aside any preconceptions you may have. Once you do, I think you'll find the answer is really quite simple.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Ah. I wonder if...  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I see you've just thought of someone, Master.  
Go on then, lead the way.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Whoever they are, I suspect they'll have the last piece of the data...  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey hey! Thanks for coming.  
You guessed it: I'm the last piece of the puzzle.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I may not have mentioned it before, but I've used the infirmary myself, and I also knew the last head doctor.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
For a while, I was even the acting commander.  
Well, the previous me, anyway.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Now I see. Why didn't you tell me earlier?  
Now you've gone and wasted my time.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
See, that's the thing.  
I don't think it was a waste at all.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
This data is... Well, to put it sentimentally,  
it's a memento of an old comrade in arms.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
So I didn't want to just hand it over to you as dull and senseless data. I wanted reading it to be a struggle.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
And it seems my gamble paid off, since you look like you thought about it pretty seriously while you read it.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...The only thing I know now that I didn't before is that the last head doctor and I are very different people.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
That's fine. Hell, as a starting point,  
it's more than enough for now.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Anyway, now that you've made it this far,  
I won't give you the runaround any longer.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Let's see these legendary medical skills of yours. Skills that staggered Hades and pissed Zeus off.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
My treatment methods aren't meant for spectacle...but if that's what you require, then I suppose I have no choice.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I'll consider this the procedure I need to perform to cure the malady that is an incomplete infirmary and return it to perfect health.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Don't think I'll go easy on you just  
because your body is that of a child's.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
If the circumstances call for it, I have no compunctions about deploying even the most painful treatments!  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Yeah, that was impressive all right. I didn't think you'd know your way around the inner structure of a magecraft device as well as the human body.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Are you satisfied now?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hehe, that depends on how you react. By this point,  
you should be able to tell what's really necessary.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Even if you collect all the old exam data,  
it still won't be enough on its own.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
'Cause if you want to grasp the full breadth of its information, and not just see the raw data alone...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...you need to have a foundation in place  
that can make sense of it.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
It's a lot like programming. Just because you can read numerals and English doesn't mean you'll be able to make heads or tails of source code unless you know your way around an IDE.  
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;.  
.  
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;.  
.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
There, that's all the data I can give you.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
So...what are you gonna do now?  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Good question.  
I think...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
---  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...I'll need to start by talking to you two.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I want to know more about the last doctor. Not just as data, but as a person, from the people who knew him best.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
My pleasure.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You got it.  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...Thanks, Asclepius.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Now I can really trust you to carry on his work.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, why don't we put on some tea?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, we'll have to get Mash in here, too.  
She knew him better than anyone, even us.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...Phew.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I see. Now I understand.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
You really had no interest whatsoever in pushing medicine forward. Not even at the beginning.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
The advances you made were only ever secondary. You intentionally excluded everything from your purview except for your own goals.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
The things he did?  
It's pretty simple, really.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
He put his whole heart and soul into doing the things he could do and that had to be done, and he didn't even try to do things he couldn't and didn't have to do.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
That's all there is to it. He knew the limitations of being human better than anyone.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
He knew that if he reached for more than he needed, he'd end up dropping everything he was holding onto.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
When you have a patient at the brink of death before your very eyes, and you expect their symptoms are going to grow even worse...  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...you have no choice but to focus your  
energies on treating them.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I see now that those were the circumstances, ever since you came to Chaldea. No...for your whole life.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Essentially, all of humanity was your patient and it was your job to take preventive measures through symptomatic treatment...against their disease of ruin.  
  
**Narration:**   
However, there is still no end to the problems that have yet to be resolved. If we fail to advance now, we'll eventually be stuck with nowhere to go.  
  
**Narration:**   
My predecessor must have known that...so why did he give up on that responsibility right from the start?  
  
**Narration:**   
...The answer is simple.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...I see. I've been entrusted to do it for him.  
  
**Narration:**   
After talking with Fujimaru and the others, and reviewing all of the data again, I realized that, in one sense, it was a highly committed decision.  
  
**Narration:**   
There was a quiet but unshakable spirit  
in everything he did during his tenure.  
  
**Narration:**   
I'll let someone else push things forward.  
I just don't have it in me right now.  
  
**Narration:**   
I want someone who's up to the task to take it over for me. I'm sure that one day, someone like that will show up.  
  
**Narration:**   
After all...  
  
**Narration:**   
...that's what life needs if it's  
going to make it to the future.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
...What incredible optimism.  
No...what incredible conviction.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I see. So you were absolutely certain that one day,  
a doctor like me would find their way here.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
That Fujimaru would, miraculously, meet someone like me, and form a connection with them.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I'm amazed you managed to pull that off.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Even if the circumstances did leave you no choice, that's still not the kind of choice just anyone could make, let alone see through to the end...  
  
**Narration:**   
I finally feel as though I truly understand him.  
  
**Narration:**   
I used to think he was just an ordinary man...but now, I see what an extraordinarily difficult feat he accomplished.  
  
**Narration:**   
He and I may have very different methods, but he still fulfilled his duty as a doctor. Of that, I have no doubt.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I can't be your substitute, nor would I want to.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
You and I are very different people, with very different stances. I doubt I'll be able to carry out all of your wishes in the way you would prefer.  
  
**Narration:**   
But, that said...  
  
**Narration:**   
...I do now understand that he wished to protect this place&ndash;this world&ndash;even if it meant giving up his entire present and future.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
So, you win.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I'll take up the work you left behind,  
though I will do so in ways I see fit.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
And if nothing else...I promise this infirmary and Chaldea's medical endeavour shall build upon the foundation you created.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
So don't worry about a thing.  
Rest assured, all is in good hands...Dr. Roman.
