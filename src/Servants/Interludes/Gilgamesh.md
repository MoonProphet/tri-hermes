# Gilgamesh  
  
## What's Worthy  
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
So this is the fate of the Greater Grail?  
&mdash;Hmph. A terrible end.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Based on what I know, if everything had gone the way they should, the ceremony could have accomplished something.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um.  
Gilgamesh, do you know about the Greater Grail?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Sorry...  
It was impudent of me to even speak, wasn't it...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fear not. You must be the Demi-Servant. Then I shall allow it. However, refer me as your King from now on.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Sure!  
T-T-Then from now on, I'll call you by King of Heroes!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh my. The scary King of the Uruks has taken a liking to our Mash.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Think he's got his reasons?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Mage. No, I see that you refer to yourself as a Doctor,  
then Physician is what I shall call you.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Physician from the future.  
What are you people, this Chaldea?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I speak not only of the Demi-Servant.  
The young one there is far too inexperienced.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
An incomplete warrior and a barely competent Master.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Do you truly believe a pairing like that can secure the future of humanity?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's harsh. It was a tough decision for me, too.  
Right, Fujimaru?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There are no other Masters.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I must fight even if I'm not competent.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Senp... no, Master is right.  
I understand that you disapprove of us.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But there's no one else left at Chaldea who can fight.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We have no choice but to mature through this battle, O King of Heroes.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
So you fight because you must... If you put it that way,  
then I can't question such determination any further.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Humans are creatures that only develop their talents for the sake of the benefits they gain.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fujimaru. Mash. Ascertain to the utmost what your benefits are in this battle.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
But first, you must guarantee my benefits.  
Otherwise, we will be enemies.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
E-Enemy!? S-S-Senpai, what do you think benefits the King of Heroes?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Treasure? It's treasure, isn't it?  
But we don't have any treasure that could satisfy him!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, more like we want treasure!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Help us, Doctor!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Don't lose your composure. I expect no treasure from you. What I seek from you is, THAT.  
  
   
**Monster:**   
FUUUUuuuuuuu&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Shadow Servants!  
We're surrounded, Master!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
The souls of the dead came at my call. Fujimaru. I shall use them to test your worth.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I expect victory, though it need not be overwhelming.  
I seek an entertaining victory.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, he just wants to test his Master.  
No need to hold back, then.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru, Mash! Show that King what you can do!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Of course, don't forget to also give the King of Heroes your orders. You are his Master right now, after all.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
S-Sure!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Of course, lots of orders!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
That Physician always seeks the last word. It must be hard having him as your boss, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
But, he speaks the truth. No matter how inexperienced,  
you are the [♂ man /♀️ woman} I contracted with.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fear me, respect me,  
and fulfill your duty as the one who contracted with me!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
I suppose that will do. How does it feel to survive what could have been a Holy Grail War?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That was a Holy Grail War?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That was really something...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Excellent. I was slightly entertained.  
Your struggles were quite an enjoyment.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Know that this is what benefits me.  
For now, at least.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm... so the King of Heroes dislikes humans?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru is one thing, but you're saying humanity isn't worth protecting?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Are you a fool? There is no like or dislike.  
Humans simply have no value.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
All of you, remember this. Humans have no value.  
Their creations, however, are worth something.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I love one thing: results.  
Think well on this, and never forget it.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I see. So that's the kind of king he is.  
This Servant's going to be a handful.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But he's certainly powerful.  
You can count on him to the end.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Although it'll be tough, so good luck, Fujimaru.  
I'm trusting you to take care of the King of Heroes.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
O-Okay...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm not sure if I can do it...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
G-Good luck, Senpai!  
I'm not much, but I have your back!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou.  
  
  
## Law of Creation  
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(The King... He seems angry and irritated...  
He's in the worst mood possible, Senpai!)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Kyu... Kuu, fouuuuu...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(First the Massive Cavern, now Angrboda...  
Maybe he has some attachment towards the Grail?)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Maybe it's just a whim?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Maybe he likes to feel like a Last Boss?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I can hear you, Chaldea trio. Your imprudence and optimism can even feel refreshing.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I am not observing the remains of the Greater Grail, but rather the disposition of the one who made it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The one who made the Greater Grail...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Back in Angrboda, it was “M”... a mage named Makiri Zolgen. Do you mean him?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fool. The likes of Makiri cannot create cauldrons of magic. This is&mdash; No, I shall remain silent for now.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
All the clairvoyants other than myself are keeping their mouths shut.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
If I say anything here, all their efforts will be for naught, yes?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wow! Who knew the King of Heroes was capable of showing consideration for other people!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Hmmmm. However, who do you mean by the other “clairvoyants”?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
&mdash;Perhaps the most famous would be him, that half-incubus mage...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Merlin, the Mage of Flowers. If what I have heard about his powers is true, he could also see the obsession burned into this Greater Grail.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Obsession? You mean there's a curse placed on this Magical Reactor Core?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Indeed. As proof, look. The souls of those who have failed to die have gathered.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, look out!  
I've detected hostiles from within the fog!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Looks like the ghosts that were seared onto this land.  
Fujimaru, you should be able to handle them now.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You're in the presence of the King of Heroes.  
You have my permission to go crazy to impress him!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
The dead never learn. They're like moths to a flame&mdash;Hmm?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Be careful! I'm picking up a large amount of magical energy! Is the core still active!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm seeing an A-Rank Servant heading for you!  
Fujimaru, Mash, be careful!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I see it's not only humans that retain their attachment to the world of the living even in death.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
These are the remnants of a dream. The dying screams of those who dreamed of progress and a brighter world.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Very well. You are worthy of my judgment.  
Fujimaru, prepare yourself.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Just like the physician said, if you can defeat him, I'll give you a reward.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
So you defeated it. After fighting it, I found it to be nothing more than a boring monster.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hatred cannot dwell in a silent machine. That was the obsession of the fool who made the Greater Grail.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
O King of Heroes, what do you mean?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
The hatred of the enemy that Chaldea seeks, the one who seeks to incinerate the history of man.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I have little interest in the battle this time around.  
I don't care who's the mastermind.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
However&mdash; This I shall say. Fujimaru, what you're chasing is an avatar of hatred.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Of course, there are different types of hatred.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hatred born of righteousness, or love.  
Hatred born of jealousy, or anger.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
This hatred is&mdash;  
Yes, it is a most “foolish” hatred.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A foolish hatred?  
Generally speaking, hatred is not good for anyone.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But from a broader perspective, there is neither “good hatred” nor “bad hatred.” In that case, my King, what makes you call it foolish?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Idiot. Look at what's around you. Nothing is born, nothing is achieved... The ultimate form of idleness.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
If this isn't foolish, what is!?  
Nothing here is saved!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Listen, Mash. May it be evil or foolish, all actions result in benefit.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
But this kind of hatred exists as well: the hatred of a fool obsessed with leaving nothing behind.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...It matters not.  
Someday you shall face this thing.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
And when you do, remember what it is you fought to protect.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The problem with this king is that he occasionally says things that seem significant.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, we should keep his words in mind, with a grain of salt that is. Okay, let's head back, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It seems like the King's in a better mood.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Hold on, we forgot something...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Um, where's my reward?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, that's right. The King promised a reward.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He said if we beat this monster he'd reward us!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fool. Would I ever break a promise?  
The reward has been granted already.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
One way or another, you'll understand during the next battle. Boorish fool, don't make me explain everything to you.  
  
  
## Law of Heaven  
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
I hear there are dragons on this island.  
Naturally, we shall go on a hunting trip. Now prepare yourselves, mongrels.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
O-Of course. But my King, some regions revere dragons as gods, so wouldn't we be cursed or suffer divine punishment for troubling what could be a local deity?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It won't work, Mash. Saying that kind of stuff will only get him more pumped up.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Those are insignificant for my king.  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hmph, it seems Fujimaru is starting to understand.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Indeed, those who would dare cower themselves before the gods shall be punished my hands.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Alright! Time for a good hunt!  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Indeed it is! Fine reply, Fujimaru! It seems your heart is starting to understand the joys of battle!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
This is not good, Doctor. Senpai and the Golden King are suddenly on the same wavelength!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. Talk about unexpected.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm not sure if it's because Fujimaru can get along with everyone, or Gilgamesh is just more reasonable than we believed.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Either way, both of them are in perfect sync.  
Even if it's just a momentary miracle!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hah hah hah. I only came here to while away the time, but it actually looks like things are starting to get entertaining! Fujimaru, prepare yourself for a grand adventure!  
  
   
**Monster:**   
GuyyyyyyyoooOOOOO!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And of course there would be a monster waiting!  
Senpai, this is starting to feel like a stereotypical pattern!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Foolish girl, we are going to hunt down dragons! Then it is only natural to encounter monsters in a forest...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...or perhaps monsters in a cave, or even more powerful monsters in the depth of that cave!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
And that is what makes any adventure a tale worth telling for! Do not be mistaken about that!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
We finally made it through the forest, and now we're facing a labyrinth? ...Master, I'm sure you understand by now...  
  
   
**Monster:**   
...Mah.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Interesting, golems constructed using the language of dragons is quite a rare sight. It seems there is a knowledgable one amongst the dragons fallen here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Those are powerful golems standing in our way.  
We have no choice but to defeat them. Right, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash... Are you mad?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
C'mon, let's enjoy this, okay?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't have time for that! I shouldn't worry because both Senpai and the King are by my side, but fighting golems made by dragons is scary!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Dragon:**   
Welcome, and how are you today?  
This is my magical workshop, Vortak's Dragonbones.  
  
   
**Dragon:**   
An underground labyrinth was slated to undergo construction to lure some unlucky humans in so I can slaughter them and take their money but...  
  
   
**Dragon:**   
...We're actually still a month away from our grand opening, but your timing couldn't be more perfect: I was just looking for some helpers.  
  
   
**Dragon:**   
Therefore, as much as I want to let you go, I guess I can't really do that. Especially now you found out about my grand plan.  
  
   
**Dragon:**   
Get roasted by my breath and succumb to your fate. I'd like you well-done and working a 60-hour week as my bone-cushion.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I didn't have my hopes up, but this is just terrible.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If King Gilgamesh is invovled, either we get something really scary or really weird!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hahahaha, your praise is music to my ears, Mash!  
But even I am at a loss for words!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I came searching for a dragon so I may test my Master's worth, but to think I would find such an idiot here!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fujimaru, accept this as your fate.  
Minds that think alike attracts each other.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
It seems your lot in life is to have idiots as your worthy opponents.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't think that statement applies to me...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I know. I'm like a weirdo magnet.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I hate to interrupt when you're having fun. Despite that dragon's behavior, that thing there is the real deal!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It has more magical energy than an A-rank Servant!  
It might be even more powerful than Fafnir!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No way! It looks like it has such a dreadful brain though!  
  
   
**Dragon:**   
My brain is not dreadful.  
My thoughts are dreadful. Nay, evil!  
  
   
**Dragon:**   
It costs you nothing to enter, but everything to leave! I'll suck your bones dry and throw you away like a pile of trash!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Dragon:**   
Guaaaaaaarrrrrgghhhh!  
To be defeated even before my grand opening...  
  
   
**Dragon:**   
It can't be... Are you the Counter Force that will eliminate any threat to the world before it occurs&ndash;The Seventh Guardian!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...The battle is over... Who knew that idiot of a dragon would be so powerful... It really was the worst...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Whoa... Not only that, this guy is dirt poor!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Dragons are generally known for hoarding treasure, but this one's lair is as empty as its skull!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There's nothing good about this dragon!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Is that true!? I cannot believe my eyes... His treasury is completely empty...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
It must have wasted everything on trying to build its labyrinth...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Couldn't even scrounge up some treasure to leave at the finish line, the worthless fool...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, our goal here was never this labyrinth to begin with...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right. My King, you said earlier you wanted to test Senpai's worth...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is that just you being considerate? So that Senpai can be acknowledged as a proper Master?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fool, do not utter such nonsense.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
A proper Master? The day this [♂ boy /♀️ girl} becomes a proper Master, this world shall no doubt be saved already.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I simply came here to sharpen the edge of my treasured sword, Ea. I was sure Ea would end up in a good mood if it faced a dragon.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
However... Hm... Fujimaru, you have done well for a mongrel.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Our enemy was the worst this time, but I shall find you worthy prey next time.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Accept that as the proof of your own growth. You have become a mage worthy of hunting the most exquisite prey.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're right.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thank you for your gracious words, O King of Heroes.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hmph, it was but a trivial matter. No need to thank me. Now then, it's time to go; I have no more use for this miserable place.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
My King, wait! ...He went on ahead. Was he trying to hide his own embarrassment?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I don't think so. He might just be bored of us. Ultimately, that man has no concept of embarrassment or sympathy.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Either way, there's no doubt he has acknowledged us.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I was a little nervous and unsure of what's going to happen when he formed a contract with us... But his arrogance and self-righteousness is rather reliable now.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou!
