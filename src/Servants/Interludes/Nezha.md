# Nezha  
  
## The Feudists  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I was just reading.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I wanted to learn more about Nezha,  
so I was re-reading her story.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I had read “Journey to the West” before, but I learned of “Investiture of the Gods” only recently.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Have you heard of it?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Both novels are pretty popular.  
   
**Mash:**   
Really?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't think that many people have read the original text...  
   
**Mash:**   
So there are many spin-off works from the original text.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Human culture never ceases to amaze me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The frequently mentioned Chinese classics are: “Journey to the West,” “Romance of the Three Kingdoms,” “Water Margin,” and “The Plum in the Golden Vase.”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Though many of the passionate readers switch the “Golden Vase” with “Investiture of the Gods” to insist that it is one of the great classic Chinese novels.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And some say that the “Investiture of the Gods” is one of the great Chinese classics, along with “Romance of the Three Kingdoms” and “Journey to the West.”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I also took a brief look at related Chinese texts...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But it appears that the lore for Nezha greatly differs from work to work.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Really?  
   
**Mash:**   
It appears that she has Taoist,  
Buddhist, and even Hindu origins.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Although, that isn't really unique,  
even among the Servants we know...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There's just one question (read: gender) to clear up.  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, here's your coffee. I believe there are certain topics that are best left alone.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
The Nezha that we know appears to be the most similar to the version from “Journey to the West”...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Nezha of “Investiture of the Gods” seems like a better fit for a Berserker than a Lancer...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But Nezha is...hard to define. So many characteristics and aspects are jumbled together.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In “Investiture of the Gods,” many supernatural beings and spirits of various time periods assemble and participate in a bloody melee.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's like Chaldea.  
   
**Mash:**   
If you're likening “Investiture of the Gods” to an all-star battle set during the Ming Dynasty, you would not be far off the mark.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Though, I would prefer to not use the word “melee”...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Both Heroic Spirits and humans have hidden sides.  
   
**Mash:**   
True...it's not right to judge others by rumors or titles alone.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
On one hand, Nezha is enshrined as a god in China and Southeast Asia, even in modern times.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Don't you think it's odd for a god to be depicted as a youth?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I was very curious about that,  
and that's why I went to the library...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why don't we just ask Nezha?  
   
**Mash:**   
Wouldn't...that be too...bold of us?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
With so many aspects, maybe there are some she would prefer be left alone? Still...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Long have I awaited this day...  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is that legendary drink called “coffee.”  
It's black, so please drink it all down.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Everyone is my teacher in life,  
and they are also my friends...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Even were it necessary for a mission,  
I'd like to avoid anything that could hurt them...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Though...my curiosity may be winning out over all that...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um...Nezha's schedule for today is...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It appears that she is participating in a meeting run by the “Buddhist Club.”  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's new. Where do they meet?  
   
**Mash:**   
This is the first I heard of the group, as well.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I've heard of groups like “Old Men Seriously Reading Fairytales” and “Air Basketball Club”...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How do you know about this club?  
   
**Mash:**   
Because I'm aware of all the clubs that are active in Chaldea!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well...at least I wanted to be.  
I may have exaggerated a bit...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So actually, an anonymous Japanese Lancer came to me to discuss something, and that's how I heard about it.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
The meeting is held...in the simulator room, it seems.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can even hear the sounds of battle all the way out here. I can only assume that an extensive training session is underway.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Forcing my way in.  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, Senpai!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'd like to join the club.  
   
**Mash:**   
If it's a Buddhist Club, would the conditions to join the club be renouncing the world and becoming a monk?  
  
   
  
  
---  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Nezha:**   
Master!  
Have. No need. For assistance. Or strategizing.  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
This is training!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I know!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's why I wanted to join.  
  
  
---  
   
**Benkei:**   
Wonderful, Lord Nezha.  
Such superb fighting technique!  
  
   
**Benkei:**   
My naginata is certainly getting a workout.  
Your mystical spear is especially ravishing!  
  
   
**Benkei:**   
And this is called the Fire-Tipped Spear?  
  
   
**Benkei:**   
Well, you are more than qualified to join our Buddhist Club!  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
...??? Do not. Understand.  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
Buddhist Club? More like. Feudist club!  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
But. You helped me train...  
You were. Enthusiastic. Thank you. For that.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Huh? When did this turn into a club admission test?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Actually, we welcome anyone and everyone to our Buddhist gathering.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
But honestly, I was beyond excited when I learned that Nezha had come to Chaldea!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I'd be happy to spend time with you!  
Not just when we're training, either!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
From eating vegetarian sweets, picking out a priest's stole, temple hopping...I'm game for anything!  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
You just want. Me to indulge. Your desires.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...Um...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I'm all for being wrapped in the warm embrace of friends old and new...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
But I do not remember...EVER...joining such a club.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
What I DO remember is being grabbed and dragged in here. Isn't this kidnapping!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...R-really? I was wondering why you were here.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Well, I'm relieved to know that at least SOMEONE is concerned about me!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh, but if Master is considering joining, I may be more inclined to do so, too. So, all's well that ends well!  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
Don't go. Near...Master! Evil fox spirit!!!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
MIKON!?  
The end of my poor tail is on fire!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Nezha!?  
She just used her Fire-Tipped Spear!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's going on!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're not in the simulator anymore!  
  
  
---  
   
**Benkei:**   
If I may explain...  
Lord Nezha requested a match with Lady Tamamo.  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
No. Not just a match.  
I am going. To kill her. KILL!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
WHAAAT!?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
No wonder it felt like you were just going after me!  
I don't understand this sudden assault against me!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let me guess...does Nezha see Tamamo as the character from the “Investiture of the Gods”...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That is, the fox spirit, Daji, who is said to have caused the decline of the Shang dynasty!?  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
Yes! Correct!  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
She is. The unparalleled trickster. Brutal. Conniving fox! She will. Surely cause. Chaldea's downfall!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Oh, really?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
So, so...were you also Lady Huangyang from Tianzhu all that time ago? She was pretty foxy, too.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Hmmm...hmmm...  
Tamamo doesn't know♡  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I can neither confirm nor deny such a thing... I'm a little fuzzy when it comes to my past life and stuff...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Even so, that has nothing to do with the Tamamo in Chaldea.  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh, Master...!  
  
   
**Benkei:**   
Ah, that's our Master. Your acceptance and generosity toward others is more vast than any ocean!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Yes! That's my disciple you're talking about!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
But...I will have a word with you later,  
Benkei, for starting this whole kerfuffle.  
  
   
**Benkei:**   
Hmgh!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Fight, and whoever wins shall be my consort!  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Mikon!? I heard something just like that in my previous life! Ah, that brings back memories... Now I'm all fired up!  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
C-consort!?  
I-I refuse! Why ME!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right, Senpai!  
Please do not tease them like that!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
That's right, my disciple! If we're going to do it, it'll have to be fair and square! Like in a tournament!  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
X-Xuanzang!  
You half-witted monk!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Leaving the consort issue aside...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Fated enemies... Such encounters are bound to happen in a place where Servants assemble.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Nezha's grudge would probably have come up at some point.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
But since she came by seeking help from our club...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I am not asking for help, not this shrine maiden♡  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Leaving the source of the dispute alone would likely affect future activities for Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Now, you two...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Since we have the simulator here, why don't we banish our worldly desires here?  
  
   
**Benkei:**   
Hm...what are you suggesting?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A one-on-one all-out...battle?  
  
  
---  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Yep. That's right.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Personally, I prefer not to believe that Tamamo is a bad Heroic Spirit...  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
Xuanzang...  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
That. Is quite. A grand sentiment.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...One-on-one!? (Ears twitching)  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...Teehee. That's the spirit.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
You started this, so you won't mind if I hit back full-force, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Tamamo is quite riled up.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Very well. I accept your challenge!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
And then I will assume the position of reliable consort, once and for all! Please watch, Master☆  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
I thought. We dropped. The idea.  
Of becoming. Master's consort?  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Now, this will be a fair and square one-on-one fight! And your opponent will be ME!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Don't you dare say you've never seen anything like this in Chaldea! Just come at me!  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
Body clones!? Divided Spirits!?  
Oh, yes!  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
Even I. Know. Three-faced. Six-armed. Battle techniques. I shall. Be your. Greatest Opponent!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Nezha:**   
I won! It is my! Victory!  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
Even if. The evil. Fox spirit. Goes mad.  
Everything should. Be fine. Since I. Am here!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I...lost...unnnghhh... The path to becoming the perfect Servant...cannot be walked in a single day...  
  
   
**Benkei:**   
But it was a grand battle.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
You think so? I think Nezha needs more training.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Growing is good, especially for Nezha,  
who will always remain in her childhood form.  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
I once. Sealed away. Ninety-six demons.  
So three. Or even. A hundred. Demons&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm counting on you, Nezha.  
   
**Nezha:**   
Oh...Master...  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
Okay! Got it!  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
I will focus. And work. My hardest!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thanks for holding back, Tamamo.  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Master... Of course...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
As the shrine maiden with a permanent spot reserved at Master's side, it's the least I can do☆  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
So it appears that Nezha not only possesses memories from “Journey to the West,” but also from the “Investiture of the Gods.”  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
Yes. That is. Just another. Part of. My past.  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
The “me.” From then. Always sought. New enemies.  
And I was. Violent... Dangerous...  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
I was. Like...a Berserker. I had. No right.  
To bad-mouth. The Great Sage. Heaven's Equal.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What kind of person do you want to be now, Nezha?  
  
  
---  
   
**Nezha:**   
Master...  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
I...I...honestly...  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
Rather than. A strong god. Of martial arts. I want to be. A good god. One who. Is kind. To children.  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
I hated. And cursed. My parents. Especially Father.  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
Even now. Even with. My soul. Wandering so. The flame. Within me. Has yet. To be. Fully extinguished.  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
And so. I wish. To cherish. The young. I want. To Protect. Children. And save them. From going through. What I. Once did...  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
My desires...may not. Match up.  
With other. Strong people's...  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
They may. Not fit. A Servant. Of Chaldea...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No! That's not true, Nezha.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We welcome Nezha with open arms!  
Right, Senpai!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There is strength in kindness.  
  
  
---  
   
**Nezha:**   
...I see.  
Then...I'm relieved. Master...thank you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hey, by the way...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There's something I've been curious about...  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There's a subject we haven't addressed...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Take a look at this list, and tell me which one you identify with...  
  
  
---  
   
**Nezha:**   
...Hm?  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
“Male,” “Female,” “Both,” “None,” “Beep-boop,” “Astrodroid,” “Non-binary”...  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
...HMMMMMMMMMMM!?  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
NO, Master! Understand that. There are. Some topics. That I. Do not. Wish to. Talk about. Even at. My Master's. Earnest request!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai! Please have this scalding hot cup of coffee!!!
