# Romulus   
  
## Guardian of Septem is Here  
  
**Nero:**   
Umu!  
My Rome is alive and full with people as ever today!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
We no longer face the threat of the United Empire, smiles have been back on Rome's, my dear Romans' faces.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
How wonderful. I'm in a great mood today.  
Indeed&ndash;  
  
   
**Nero:**   
It's sad I won't see Fujimaru and Mash ever again, but I'm the emperor of Rome!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
As long as my people have smiles on their faces, all I need is to reign over and govern Rome with unlimited love!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
My talent has no limit, and neither does my love.  
The applause of roses will always resound in Rome!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I'm so excited!  
Which song should I sing today?  
  
   
**Romans:**   
Oh, I see her Imperial Majesty over there!  
She's as bright as Apollo, and as beautiful as Venus!  
  
   
**Romans:**   
Long live her Majesty!  
Hurray for Emperor Nero Claudius!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Umu.  
Keep on, I'll allow for the applause.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
If there's one thing to be added, I'm also as talented in art as a Muse.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Now let me sing!  
Young girls, come here and hold flowers!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Honor of Imperium is here! I'll sing with my sweet voice to people throughout the capital, no, the whole land of Rome.  
  
   
**Romans:**   
Oh, wow!  
Look, her Imperial Majesty is about to sing!  
  
   
**Romans:**   
We're blessed, but you have to put up with it!  
Don't lose your concentration, otherwise you won't last!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Hehe, even the people passing by are excited!  
I'm so happy. This is the Rome I love!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
...Whew!  
That was a great recital.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
But those orchestra folks that rushed to join.  
Isn't their performance a bit too loud?  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Didn't it drown out my sweet voice and block my singing from reaching my people?  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I understand that they get excited, but I need them to remember to be patient.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Anyway, I spent the whole morning singing. I should work on some official business in the afternoon&ndash;  
  
   
**Burrus:**   
Your Majesty.  
I bring news.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Oh, my Knight Burrus.  
What's the matter?  
  
   
**Burrus:**   
From the provinces ruled by the United Empire, we've received letters from the viceroys and director-generals who went missing.  
  
   
**Burrus:**   
I'm sorry to bother you, but I'd appreciate it if you can read it.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Umu, Burrus.  
What you just brought in is nothing less than good news!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Hand over their letter to me.  
I've been concerned about them.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
(If what Mash and others said was true, all the matters associated with the fake United Empire)  
  
   
**Nero:**   
(will disappear without a trace at some point.  
But, umu. For now I should just read the letters.)  
  
   
**Nero:**   
(My dear vassals. How did they survive from the attack of the United Empire?)  
  
   
**Nero:**   
(I should learn that.  
I'm already someone who's killed her own mother&ndash;)  
  
   
**Nero:**   
(All that's left is to continue to be the Emperor.  
I believe my love will reach both my vassals and my people)  
  
   
**Nero:**   
(...Isn't that right, O Romulus?)  
  
   
**Burrus:**   
&ndash;Your Majesty?  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Sorry, I think I got a little tired from singing.  
But not to worry.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Give me the letters. I'll make sure to hear what the governors and others must say!  
  
   
**Seneca:**   
...Your Imperial Majesty.  
You seem to be pushing yourself too hard.  
  
   
**Seneca:**   
It's already late at night.  
You should rest soon.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Oh, Seneca.  
Hehe, thank you for caring for me.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I got a stack of official work to deal with. I wish there were a few more of me so it wouldn't take this much time.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
But that wouldn't work either.  
For I am the one and only in Rome!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Hehe. It's okay.  
I'm glad to hear you say that to me.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Once, when my mother was alive&ndash;  
  
   
**Seneca:**   
Your Majesty.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Oh... Well, excuse me.  
Never mind what I just said.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I've noticed my migraines are coming back.  
Indeed this prevents me from finishing my work.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Certainly, I think I'm a little tired.  
I'm going to bed now.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
...Can I ask you to sleep by my side, private tutor?  
  
   
**Seneca:**   
Please stop kidding.  
But I'm glad you changed your mind.  
  
   
**Seneca:**   
Please rest well.  
You are our only Roman Emperor.  
  
   
**Seneca:**   
You should never push yourself too hard.  
Your recklessness will lead to Rome's recklessness.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Umu.  
That makes sense&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...No one is here.  
Nero appears to have gone to her bedroom.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wow, Imperial Privilege EX is incredible!  
It shut off your presence completely!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Besides, not only Romulus himself, but both Mash and Fujimaru as well.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I wonder which skill he used?  
Um, is it possible to tell us&ndash;King Romulus?  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Romulus?  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Excuse me&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you worrying about Nero?  
   
**Mash:**   
...Sure.  
To Romulus, Nero is like a "descendant," I suppose.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Rome?  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh, Senpai?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Romulus:**   
Every Roman is my child. Nero Claudius.  
One of my beloved children.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
With such a tiny body, the fragile girl tries to support everything in the far-off land, Rome.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
I, Rome, witnessed love in her.  
It's not gods' love, and yet not human's love, either.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
It is exactly... One of many forms of love a Roman emperor ought to possess.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Even if that path heads to none other than the Underworld itself&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Right. In several years from now Emperor Nero's political power becomes weak, and she loses the support of everyone under her.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I cannot tell her the truth,  
but sadly, it's just how the history is.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Even if everyone rejects her, even if the gods reject her.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
I, Rome, shall never reject her.  
Nero Claudius is great.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
She is&ndash;  
truly a great "Roman emperor."  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Therefore, leave immediately. The "emperors" attracted,  
gathered by my divine radiance.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What did you just say?  
We just came to check up on her, didn't we?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, I'm picking up something&ndash; It's a extremely powerful reaction, but different than a Servant!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A more vague existence. A ghost-type monster perhaps?  
But this is too powerful for something naturally created.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Augustus&ndash;!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Tiberius, Claudius!  
O, Trajanus! Hadroanus, Severus!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Names of the emperors of the ancient Roman Empire?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah, I got it!  
Those ghosts are the "emperors" themselves!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Those "emperors" were chain-summoned by Romulus's existence, attracted by it.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can sense hostility in their magical energy.  
Senpai, this is going to be a battle!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's get ready for battle!  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master!  
Your orders, please!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Rome!  
   
**Mash:**   
What!  
S-Senpai?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Romulus:**   
Emperors from the past!  
Emperors from the future!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
You must all leave now! You certainly are Rome,  
but now is the time of Nero!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
The short-lived United Empire is no more!  
Hence, O, my children, gathering in the void!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
&ndash;Behold my spear!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
This spear I hold is Rome.  
Hence, you shall&ndash;  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Return to Rome through my spear.  
O, O, Magna Voluisse Magnum!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
&ndash;Rome!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
The battle is over.  
All hostile targets were destroyed.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
...Rome will never collapse. Even if all the Roman emperors end up crawling on the ground.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Rome will continue to shine in the past,  
present, and future. I, Rome, can see that.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Look, heavenly gods.  
Behold my Rome, no&ndash;  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Behold Nero's Rome, one that lasted longer than mine.  
Beautiful. This moment of beauty is infinite.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Okay.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I think I can understand, or maybe not.  
Hmm. What exactly is he saying?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's Rome  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's Rome  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh, sure Senpai.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait a second. Mash, you just gave up on thinking, didn't you? And Fujimaru, you've been&ndash;  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Rome...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Rome...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. Rome, it is.  
Somehow&ndash;I started to understand it.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, wait, wait!  
I still don't get it, what is it?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor. No matter what history says,  
at least Nero is shining at this time.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So, she's all right as she is.  
I think he's saying...something like that.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, that is...  
what it is?  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Rome...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou...  
  
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
It's right here, Lord Seneca! We've sensed an unusual presence from the Throne Room!  
  
   
**Seneca:**   
Build up the defenses around Her Majesty's bedroom.  
I need four soldiers to follow me to the Throne Room!  
  
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
Yes sir!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Uh-oh, they'll find us!  
Now, let's Rayshift out of here!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Rome!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai!  
Rome!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
&ndash;Rome forever!
