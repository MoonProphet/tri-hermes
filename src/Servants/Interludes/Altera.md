# Altera   
  
## The Beast Inside of Me  
  
**Altera:**   
...I was waiting.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I was waiting for you to come Fujimaru.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where are we now?  
   
**Altera:**   
I don't know exactly.  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Am I, in a dream?  
   
**Altera:**   
Yes.  
You have a good intuition, Master.  
  
---  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I can't be certain, but I can guess to a certain level.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
This is&mdash;"inside of me."  
  
   
**Altera:**   
It's not something physical, but psychological.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Inside of me. I still can't say that for sure, but it's my memory. Of me, who fought as the great King of Huns.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...Inside of the memory of myself "as a hero."  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
As a hero?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't really get what you mean  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Altera:**   
It means exactly what I said. The memory of "me,"  
who was once called King of Destruction, Attila.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
One who kept on destroying every civilization like a thoughtless, wordless machine.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
It's my memory.  
That's why in here...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...there's nothing.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I didn't think "like a human being."  
I didn't feel like one either.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I couldn't think, and couldn't feel.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...To you, what do I look like?  
  
   
**Altera:**   
To me, only the sky and the earth stretch endlessly.  
It's the end of a star that was leveled with no feeling or purpose.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
To you...I suppose, it looks like a view "closest" to what you've seen.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
How you see it might be different, but this dark wasteland is indeed me.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Even though I'm supposed to be looking at my memory,  
I see nothing. No friends, and no family...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I can't hear anyone's voice.  
Nothing but gusty winds.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...Heh, talk about empty.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Despite the fact I've led many into battle, how come not even a single person is in my memory.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think it's quiet.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This is pretty calming.  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Altera:**   
You're kind.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Well, I suppose that's how people would call someone like you, kind.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I never...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...I never wished to destroy lives. Still, I always kept destroying civilizations far as the eyes can see.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
You see the contradiction?  
I can't help myself from choosing this way.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I deviate from this planet's absolute principle&mdash;  
that its purpose of survival is breeding.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
"Destruction" is implanted deep within my heart.  
I don't want to willingly kill, but I want to destroy.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
As a result people die. I killed many of them.  
The earth was always soaked with blood.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...However.  
What is left for me is this dark wilderness...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Look&ndash;  
it's coming.  
  
   
**???:**  
&mdash;  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I said there's nothing, but well, it wasn't true.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I've got ones like them.  
Those who have unclear names, with no faces.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Those whom I fought against and killed. I simply fought and killed without recognizing them as individuals.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Now it's time to use your power, Master. Though only if that summoning system of your works.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
You have no choice but to fight, if you don't want to die.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...I'm not sure if death exists in this place, though.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Altera:**   
Splendid job, Master. You managed to stay alive because of the summoning system.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...This is a dream, right?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I feel like I am using a lot of magical energy.  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Altera:**   
This indeed is a dream, but our minds here are real.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Magical energy exists as a link between your mind and body, right? In that case, it's only natural you use it.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Have you used it all up yet? No, that's good to hear.  
You see, it's not over yet.  
  
   
**???:**  
&mdash;  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...This time, it doesn't even look like a human.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I wonder what that was. I feel like I have a dim memory of having killed a monster.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Or, maybe that is formed by some sort of concept?  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Whatever that is&ndash;  
  
   
**???:**  
&mdash;!!!  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...Hmm. For a mere concept, I see it's ready to kill.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...I'm so ashamed I could pass out.  
I can't believe I even envy such a thing.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Feelings, emotions.  
Things that I lacked, but now gained.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
However, I can't control these feelings well.  
I've understood joy, but I don't how to express it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
L-Let's just focus on the monster before us!  
  
---  
   
**Altera:**   
Of course, you know your priorities, Master.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think you're just awkward.  
  
---  
   
**Altera:**   
...That's a problem.  
Many of my allies would tell me that back then.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
It makes me happy, but I'm sad.  
I really wish it was true.  
  
   
  
   
**Altera:**   
At any rate, we need to defeat that thing first.  
Come on Master, try to pull it off again.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
You'll actually die if you die here.  
If that happens, our contract will end.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I'll be free from this subordination, and you'll be free from life.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
But that won't be fun.  
So, try not to die.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I'd like to talk to you just a little longer.  
  
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Altera:**   
...I'm impressed, Master.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I have a better opinion of you.  
I expected you'd stand frozen or something.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Apparently I underestimated your way of existence Fujimaru, the one trying to save the world.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...It's time for you to go back.  
This place isn't appropriate for you to stay long.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
It only needs me.  
This place&ndash;  
  
   
**Altera:**   
&ndash;This darkness, belongs to "me".  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You didn't come out at the scheduled time, so I came to see how you were doing&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But I can see that you overslept. Are you okay?  
You seemed to be troubled by your dream.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It wasn't a bad dream.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I was fighting a real battle.  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is that...so? If you don't mind,  
can you tell me more...no, it's nothing.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Breakfast is ready.  
Let's go, Senpai.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, Foooou!  
  
  
## My Memories  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm&mdash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Based on my observation, I couldn't detect anything. Um, maybe I should expand the range?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmmm, you are in 1st century Gaul, within the second singularity that's being corrected.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Are you sure it's around here, great hero of destruction, Attila&mdash;I mean, Altera?  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Don't call me Attila. Yes, I'm sure it's around here.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Someone is calling me here. I'm certain that I felt it.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
It's a destructive...impulse. What's worse, it's extraordinary.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Even if it destroys everything in sight, it still won't calm down... That's what it is.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
An impulse, huh? I don't know how to understand a phenomenon that can't be observed with numbers.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She probably meant she sensed something similar to that of magical energy.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Magical energy, hmm? I see, I won't deny that, but...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
It's more like a forced command, one more powerful than Command Spells. That's what I've sensed.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you sure about that?  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I am wondering the same.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Forced command, huh...  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Right. It might be best for us to be prepared for combat.  
  
   
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, Fou Fooou!  
  
   
**Altera:**   
It seems like it is already approaching us. A collection of destructive impulses.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's a Servant! If we're just picking that up now, that means...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...it's hiding in spirit form until our arrival! Senpai!  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...I am troubled.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Oh, no... See, I knew it. I am troubled because of it...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
I can smell that person... No wait, it's a smell similar to that person...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Why do I sense it? Why do I think like this?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...That woman...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
She must be one of the women... Who tried to get close to my...Sigurd...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Oh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're Brynhild...right? A woman who tried to get close to your Sigurd? Who are you talking about?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
She's looking at me. So that destructive impulse is directed to me.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
But I don't remember anyone named Sigurd. Hm...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah! No, Altera, try to remember!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
How do I explain this... It's not Sigurd per se, but someone who shares the same origin and legend as him...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You've already met him, Altera. That's right, this has happened before...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wait, I'm sorry. I'm getting confused so let me get this straight.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In other words...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Siegfried and Altera married "the same woman?"  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Yes, that's right. After I died, my wife Kriemhild remarried Etzel&ndash;  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
In other words, the great king of the Huns. I heard that the great king also lost his wife.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Kriemhild...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
My wife, huh?  
Wife...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Wife...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't you remember?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I didn't know you had a wife.  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Altera:**   
I'm familiar with her name, but it feels unrealistic to have a wife.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I know nothing except for war and destruction. I never directed my attention to anything else.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
So...it's possible that woman was there for me.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh I see, one of Altera's retainers probably played it smart and had them married for diplomatic reasons.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How business-like...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oh, I-I see.  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...I do have some thoughts on that, but this is not the place to talk about it.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I heard Kriemhild used King Etzel for her revenge.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
What led her to seek revenge was my death. So, I'm in no position to accuse the king.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Etzel&ndash;  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Etzel, huh&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What's the matter, Altera?  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Well, the name Etzel isn't bad.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It does sound cute.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think the name fits you.  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Altera:**   
...It's not...what I meant.  
It's not...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
It's not that.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Seems like it is.)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Yes, it is.)  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
(Indeed.)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
(Fou, Fou Fou♪)  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...It's not...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Do you remember now?  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Indeed, I do. But I suppose he is a different existence, or hero, than Sigurd.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Siegfried and Sigurd. I hear both of them are heroes with the same origin...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Oh...  
Oh my...how can that be?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
That's exactly what I thought.  
Taking...a wife... There's no way it can be...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
&mdash;Forgiven.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's not getting through to her!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Whoa, this seems dangerous!  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes, Senpai!  
She's obviously gone into battle mode!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What, a Servant battle!?  
Now?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...Fight me with everything you have.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Hmm, she wishes to fight.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Very well, I shall answer that wish. All I can do is wield the sword of destruction.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Come.  
The sword of Mars shall crush you&mdash;!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Brynhild:**   
...Oh... What...was I...doing?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Don't tell me... Was I fighting?  
Me? Against you?  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Yes.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
I-I see, so that's what happened.  
I wonder why...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
It's odd. Sometimes I attack men, but usually not women.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It sounds horrible, but yes, most of Brynhild's victims are men.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Her Noble Phantasm feels like it's that way, too&ndash;  
E-Either way, I am happy we could clear up that misunderstanding!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes.  
It was just a matter of pressing the wrong button!  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Hmm...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Oh?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, Fou...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...Anyway, I was lucky to fight such a powerful individual. It helped adjust the aim for my Noble Phantasm.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, Fou.  
Kyao?  
  
  
## My Sword of the God of War  
  
**Altera:**   
   
...So we meet again.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Rather, do you still remember?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course I do.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It was in a dark and stormy wasteland...  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Altera:**   
I see. So you...remember that.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
How strange... Or perhaps not. I have come to understand that human memories are unpredictable.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I may be repeating myself, but I shall explain the bare minimum...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
We are within my memories.  
The memory that equates to a dark wasteland.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Regardless, this place has nothing of value.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
To rephrase, this is the memory of my birth.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
If this dark wasteland was formed using memories of my life...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...then my life was...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
No, this place was given shape by memories created before I walked my so-called life.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is this your birthplace?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Were you born here?  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Altera:**   
This is where I was discovered, where I awakened&mdash;this cave.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
A darkened ruin. Remnants of a civilization thousands of years ago...or so I hear.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
How do you see it?  
I can only see it as a dark cave...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
This is an ancient ruin left in the Sahara Desert.  
Within, the Hun elders sought me out.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
To be exact, I was not born a Hun.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
But the ones who raised me and made me into their king were undoubtedly the Hun elders.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
In my youth, after killing a soldier for the first time, I was told...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...That I exist to fight.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
This crest of war on my flesh, and this sword of the War God... I had them from the very beginning.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I had no father or mother. I was simply discovered by the descendants of the Huns.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I was asked to become destruction itself.  
So...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
That is what I did. I became destruction incarnate.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...I did not want to kill. Yet I did not and still do not understand the so-called value of life.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I do not know many things. Oh, how I do not know so very much of this world's matters.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
If things are taken, broken, killed...what becomes of it?  
  
   
**Altera:**   
These things simply vanish from this land for eternity.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
It's simple. It's plain and simple.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Destruction is...something easily accomplished, yet irreversible.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
However, my existence adapted well to the act.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Did it pain you?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you sad?  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Altera:**   
Who knows. That is a difficult question for me.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
It's what you call emotions, correct? I know.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I understand that others possess them.  
However, I cannot feel.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
What exists within me is only...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
No. Let's speak of it later.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I might have worried too much over small matters...  
It looks like that thing from the wasteland has come to pursue me.  
  
   
**???:**  
...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Now, let us battle, like we always do.  
I won't mind if you just step aside and watch.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll fight.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can't leave you like this.  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Altera:**   
...I see. Then let's go.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Altera:**   
That does it. Hmm.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I must apologize. It seems my idle chatter has attracted something unnecessary.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Keep telling us the story.  
  
---  
   
**Altera:**   
...You sure are curious.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't think it's idle chatter.  
  
---  
**Altera:**   
...Is that so.  
  
   
  
   
**Altera:**   
...Okay.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Then I'll continue. Let me tell you what is inside the vessel shaped as I am.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I do not feel the emotions&ndash;the sadness, the happiness&ndash;that you people do.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Instead, there is only destruction.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
All that these hands can do is destroy, shatter, and kill.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Yet...sometimes I think...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
With these hands that bring nothing but destruction...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...just like you humans who live honestly on this earth...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...I want to feel affection.  
I want to embrace something, someone.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I want to acknowledge everything on Earth, not destroy it. I want to gain emotions and become a woman...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
That is what I sometimes think.  
That is what I dream.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Had I chosen a life different than that of a soldier of destruction...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
What would I have become? What would be the makeup of “me”? I could have read books. Sing. Perhaps cooked.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Or&mdash;  
  
   
**???:**  
...It's futile...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who's that!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That voice...!  
  
---  
   
  
   
**???:**  
...You are the incarnation of destruction...  
  
   
**???:**  
...The Sword of the War God is proof as such...  
  
   
**???:**  
...Destroy, destroy, destroy...  
  
   
**???:**  
...Your existence is nothing but that...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
You don't have to remind me.  
I already know.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...You're a meddlesome one, aren't you.  
  
   
**???:**  
...You have no other choice...  
  
   
**???:**  
...Admit it, acknowledge it...  
  
   
**???:**  
...Altera, no matter what time period you are in...  
  
   
**???:**  
...No matter what kind of world...  
  
   
**???:**  
...You...will...destroy...  
  
   
**???:**  
EVERYTHING!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's not looking good!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Get ready to battle!  
  
---  
   
  
   
**Altera:**   
Indeed. That voice is starting to get on my nerves.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
It's time to destroy it.  
Master, there's no need to hold back.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
That is me, but it's just me.  
Even if that dies, I will not vanish.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
So...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
So let's destroy it, Master.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Altera:**   
...This is...fine.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
How many times is this now?  
How many times have I destroyed like this?  
  
   
**Altera:**   
No, there's no way I could keep count.  
Then again, it felt a bit different this time around.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
It wasn't bad.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
If I were to express myself like a human...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
It was...fun. I suppose.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
   
I don't remember ever showing weakness before...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
However, even though you may not remember when you wake up...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I'm sorry for getting you caught up in all this.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...No. Thank you. This was the first time I was able to reject my memory by means other than my own will.
