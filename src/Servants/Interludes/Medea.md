# Medea  
  
## Witch's Backyard  
  
**Mash:**   
So, you want us to defeat the Doll King?  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Well, to put it simply, yes.  
I am requesting your involvement.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
"The Doll King?"  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't quite follow you...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medea:**   
...Must I explain it again?  
I brought a 50-centimeter diorama.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
It's a miniature garden I've made. To put it in terms you'd understand, it's a kind of Reality Marble.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, well... I mean it's just a small model of a house with figures lined up in it...  
  
   
**Medea:**   
What a rude human you are. This diorama is something that, little by little, day by day, with layer upon layer of precise spell...  
  
   
**Medea:**   
I finally succeeded in creating. The ultimate Bounded Field. Well, I guess the likes of you wouldn't be able to comprehend it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're right, I don't get it at all. My studies have been insufficient. I must reflect on this.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Caster, you like things like this, don't you?  
   
**Medea:**   
Oh, is it that obvious? I enjoy bottle ship models the best, but isn't it nice to try your hand at something grander?  
  
   
**Medea:**   
This time I got excited and made it without considering the profitability. Hehehe.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't think anyone could understand, Mash.  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, I was beginning to feel that way.  
This appears to be Medea's special hobby...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Holed up in her room, concentrated yet gloomy.  
I guess you can call that a nerdy hobby in a sense.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Please refrain from calling it a nerdy hobby.  
Some people might get hurt by that comment, like me.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
True. I take back my words.  
This isn't just any model, it's an exquisite diorama.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Well then.  
Is the "Doll King" perhaps&mdash;  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Yes.  
I'm referring to inside this small world.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Inside this diorama is what one might call another dimension. To put it into terms amateurs like yourselves could understand...  
  
   
**Medea:**   
...you could even call it the world of dolls.  
The dolls inside this house are literally alive.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Of course, this is because these are dolls I personally take the time to create.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How capable is this Witch from the Age of Gods...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She's got a lot of free time.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medea:**   
You there, what did you say?  
  
   
**Medea:**   
I already said this, so I'm sure you got it.  
I want you to perform some maintenance for me.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
The doll I gave administrative rights to over this world is ignoring my orders and has begun to act without permission.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Seriously! He has forgotten the debt owed to me as his creator and bitten the hand that feeds him!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Ah well. I don't fully understand, but couldn't we just remove that doll from the outside?  
  
   
**Medea:**   
If I could have done that, I already would have.  
If we intervene from the outside, everything will break.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
It may be easy to add or alter, but removing takes several times more skill and sense.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
There are many people who can revise a completed novel, but very few would erase the characters, no?  
  
   
**Medea:**   
That is what it means to draw elements from things that have been completed.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Even by removing a single doll, the damage would be far greater.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
This is why the beings that humans think of as gods have not laid a hand on the world since it was created.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
No matter how much damage spreads, the creators can only look on from the outside.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
In order to minimalize damage, it is best to go in and involve oneself.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Quite right, but...  
how would one enter...  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Rest assured, I will show you the way.  
Now, calm your minds...hehehehehehe.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's not reassuring at all...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I-I feel kind of light-headed...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai!?  
...Senpai!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai!  
Are you awake?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is this place?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where are we now?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank goodness, you're all right. I lost consciousness and the next thing I know, we're here...  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Well?  
Rise and shine.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Medea! What just...  
I mean, where exactly is this?  
  
   
**Medea:**   
I TOLD you. Inside the box.  
How is it, the world I so carefully constructed?  
  
   
**Medea:**   
"Imaginary Earth: Social Plan World"  
For short, "Jason World: Japan!"  
  
   
**Medea:**   
I have prepared a variety of attractions here!  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Basically, any man with a pretty face is set to meet with a terrible fateâ™¡  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, Senpai?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Talk about a hostile theme park.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How did things get so complicated?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Medea, putting aside the explanation of these "attractions," could you tell us exactly how we got here?  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Oh, you still don't understand?  
I prepared some dolls here to be used by guests.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
I shifted your consciousness here.  
Just think of it as a consciousness-only Rayshift.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Just our consciousness...  
Isn't that a big deal?  
  
   
**Medea:**   
It's all right, I've set it so you can return once you've defeated this world's administrator.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Oh, don't worry about the entry fee.  
It was my idea, so this time it's free!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Uh. It looks like there's no choice but to give in to Medea's request.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;  
Senpai, someone carrying a sword is approaching!  
  
   
**Medea:**   
That's a Level 10 general soldier, a Jason Hunter.  
It's programmed to attack normies on sight.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
There are also Jason Killers who rampage when they see couples, those who bring friends, or more than two people.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
And Jason Aces who challenge any girl under twenty on sight.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Not to mention, Naked Jason who won't rest until he destroys anything and everything around him.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Medea, that's overkill!  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Oh, and if you die here, you'll be able to return to your body... But some of the pain will carry over, so be careful.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
If you receive enough damage and die, you'll feel pain worse than death when you wake up.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Simply outrageous...  
Anyway, Master, prepare for combat!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
...Whew. We managed to defeat them,  
but those aren't just soldiers, they're monsters...  
  
   
**Medea:**   
How strange... The dolls I made are mutating?  
...I wonder what happened?  
  
   
**Automata:**   
Eradicate... Eradicate all outsiders...  
Eradicate! Eradicate! Eradicate! Eradicate! Eradicate!  
  
   
**Medea:**   
What? When did I ever make anything like THIS?  
No, this attention to detail, the smoothness of their movable parts&mdash;  
  
   
**Medea:**   
They've achieved a level superior to my own...  
I-I haven't been this embarassed in a long time! How mortifying!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Pull yourself together, Caster.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How about changing from Caster to Modeler?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I completely agree, but for now, let us concentrate on the battle! The enemy is formidable, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Whew... We managed to hold them off,  
but there'll be no end to it if we can't cut off their head.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
...It seems you won't have to worry about that.  
Here comes the head... Wait, wh-what is this?  
  
   
**Doll Princess:**   
&ndash;You dare to trample my dream?  
What kind of rude human are you?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's...Medea's shadow?  
...But doesn't it look a bit smaller?  
  
   
**Doll Princess:**   
&ndash;Now, my cute dolls. Exterminate these pests who seek to destroy this world of dreams.  
  
   
**Shadow Servant:**   
&ndash;For our Princess Medea.  
&ndash;For our Princess Medea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um... Can this be...  
Medea's...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So this is...Medea's miniature garden.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So this is Medea's wish...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medea:**   
N-NO! That's just a doll!  
It has nothing to do with me! NOTHING!  
  
   
**Medea:**   
I mean what is this "princess" nonsense? Wanting to be a princess... I mean, I am not an adolescent child anymore...  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Y-You understand, don't you Fujimaru? I'm not such a hopeless woman, right?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh... Right...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Dolls are your friends...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medea:**   
NOOOOOO!  
DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THOSE EYES!!!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Medea:**   
It's over... It's all...over...  
  
   
**Doll Princess:**   
&ndash;Curse you, ganging up on an innocent princess like myself and causing me bodily harm!  
  
   
**Doll Princess:**   
What do you take a maiden's flower garden for?  
Can you really live with yourselves if you kill a sweet princess?  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Rule Breaker!  
  
   
**Doll Princess:**   
AAAAHH!  
You princess killers! (Flop)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It looks like...it's over.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, everything...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medea:**   
...(Glare)  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Nothing happened! Absolutely nothing happened here!  
None of you saw ANYTHING! Understood?  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Fujimaru, UNDERSTOOD?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Now that's asking a little too much...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well, I guess some people are into that kind of thing...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medea:**   
What? You have a problem with that?  
I can't dream of being a princess?  
  
   
**Medea:**   
No matter her age, every girl is a princess!  
What's so wrong with that? Huh? WHAT?!  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Yeah, that's right! I'm a poor, pathetic, lonely girl who has dolls for friends!  
Kill me! I'd rather you just killed me!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, I believe that, someday, you too, Medea, will find someone to love.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Spare me your worthless sympathy! Just you watch,  
someday, I WILL find happiness, no matter what!
