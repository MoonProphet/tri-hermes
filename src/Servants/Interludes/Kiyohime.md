**Kiyohime:**   
M. A. S. T. E. R.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
!?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yes!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, please don't cry out so!  
It is I, your Kiyohime, Master.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...I too have just woke up.  
Do you know where we are?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
At any rate, let us walk.  
Look, Mash is here as well.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I can't get in contact with the Doctor.  
Anyway, let's take a walk around.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes, you're right. Let's wander around. This too is one of the delights of travel&ndash;Or so it seems.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Well, to be honest, I have never taken a real trip.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
When I chased after Lord Anchin, that most certainly could not be called a trip.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Now, then. Shall we begin walking?  
I wonder what sort of things await us.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
It sure is a little exciting, isn't it?  
Hehehehehe.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Enemies!  
Kiyohime, get ready for battle!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Umm, Kiyohime?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, my! Just when I was expecting romance, such a horrid encounter! Dear god! What have I done to deserve this?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Oh, right. I do have a vague idea of what it might be.  
Most of my behavior in life could be the cause.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hmm... I do deserve this. But for this trouble to be imposed upon my Master simply won't do...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Our trip has only just begun.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't be so hard on yourself.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Thank you, Master!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...If Elisabeth were here, she'd probably joke about this.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
Ahh, such a magnificent view.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, yes.  
...About that trip.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
The only thing that I saw was his back. That dreamy back. He abandoned me and simply ran away&ndash;  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...But just so you know.  
I did think back on my actions.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yet, still, even so.  
Why didn't he utter a single word of apology.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
If he can not do that, he could at least yell at me&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That would be tough.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's never happening.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
But why? I am not the type that would slit her wrists at the slightest reproach.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
However, my chat-room friend, Tamamo, told me,  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
"You know, your understanding of why Anchin left you is wrong at the most basic level."  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
"He didn't want to stay away from you, in fact, he liked you a little, just a little."  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
"However, your love for someone who only liked you a little is too heavy. Too much is as bad as too little."  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
"With you it's either love or hate, one or zero.  
You really need to change your digital way of thinking!"  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
That is her opinion of me...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You were too lovely.  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Because I'm lovely&ndash;  
So he didn't want to say anything harsh to me?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I see...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's a man's pride.  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
A man's pride?  
That is a matter that I am unable to comprehend.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Such a pathetic man.  
Putting on pride and running away...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Well. I am still completely unable to comprehend the heart of a man.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Tamamo tells me to trust her on matters between men and women. She says she can give me the perfect answer because of what she's been through&ndash;  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Those are the kinds of things she says...  
But for some reason, I just can't trust her.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
It seems to me she's the type that would turn to mush the moment a handsome man gazed at her seriously.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
She's usually open about her feelings, but once the man makes a move on her, she'd freeze up and get swept away.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
She always says, "It's so easy to control a man."  
But in reality, it's more like, "Serving obediently is true happiness."  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
In the Holy Grail War that we're in right now, perhaps it's a good idea to have an offline party sometimes.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Everyone knows she's a shut-in, so I don't know if that Osakabe-hime would show up.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, dear me! I'm sorry.  
I'm doing all the talking.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, I'm quite fascinated by what you're talking about.  
Chat-room buddy... Offline Party...?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I want to hear more about Master.  
How were you born, and how you've lived your life&ndash;  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
What's your favorite food?  
And what's the food you dislike?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
What's the type of woman you like?  
What's the type of man you like?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
What your schedule is like every day?  
Where do you wash first in a shower?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Your height, weight, eyesight, grip strength, speed, endurance, lung capacity, whether you've run a marathon...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh! I forgot one very important thing.  
Are there any temples that you're acquainted with&ndash;  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
If possible, I'd like to hear about them.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What would you do if I told you that?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
It's a secret.  
Hehehehehehe...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, your face has become stiff...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, my!  
Such a nice aroma.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...But wait, it seems there're some creatures who would dare to splatter the stench of blood in this beautiful forest.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Come out!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Lamia...!  
Be careful, Master!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
My, they're snake monsters.  
How hideous.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Wait, you and I both have a similar appearance.  
Then the hideous thing here is&ndash;  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Your nature as a mere beast.  
Perhaps it's because you only care about your appetite...  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
...Ahem!  
Master, would you mind averting your eyes?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You see, I'm not used to being looked at.  
Thank you so much.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, my! Such a large cavern...  
It's so mystical.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...A cavern like this seems like the best place for a dragon to keep its treasure in...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But obviously there's no dragon here.  
Yet, I do sense something.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, be careful.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
It's exactly as Mash says.  
Please stay behind me.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Do not fret. No matter what sort of monster it may be, I shall protect you.  
  
   
**???:**  
&ndash;I wouldn't be so sure about that.  
Excuse me, my dear self. May I ask you a question?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Wha...  
  
   
**Kiyohime (?):**  
Do you really think you're qualified to be a Servant?  
  
   
**Kiyohime (?):**  
You who killed the man you loved out of hate, spite, and fury? Can you really swear to protect your next Master?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You're...me?  
  
   
**Kiyohime (?):**  
Impossible! Utterly impossible!  
Because you are just a lowly beast.  
  
   
**Kiyohime (?):**  
Quit showing your pretty self, and expose your hideous form. If you think you'll be loved then, you're kidding yourself.  
  
   
**Kiyohime (?):**  
Does a soldier show the one he loves what he's like when he cruelly slaughters on the battlefield?  
  
   
**Kiyohime (?):**  
People express their love by hiding something.  
But in your case, it is deception&ndash;  
  
   
**Kiyohime (?):**  
By deceiving, don't you think you are forcing a human to love a beast?  
  
   
**Kiyohime (?):**  
It's true, is it not? You, even after revealing your true identity, shamelessly&ndash;  
  
   
**Kiyohime (?):**  
You pursued him!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
No... I never... Did...  
  
   
**Kiyohime (?):**  
Now then, Master.  
You must discard this creature.  
  
   
**Kiyohime (?):**  
Someday, this woman will reveal her true self over some petty lie, and sink her fangs into your neck.  
  
   
**Kiyohime (?):**  
It is much more sensible to reject that woman.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Never!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I refuse to.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Master...  
  
   
**Kiyohime (?):**  
I see. You are very kind.  
Just like that Anchin was.  
  
   
**Kiyohime (?):**  
But can you look upon Kiyohime's miserable, hideous form and still say that&ndash;Why don't you try?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, stand back!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Master ...I will protect you!  
That's the truth, it's not a lie!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I trust you.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I know.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Thank you!  
Here I come, impostor&ndash;!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Kiyohime (?):**  
&ndash;Hmph! You will regret it someday.  
These are my own words, so you know it's the truth.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Whew.  
Master, may I ask you one question?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Please, I beg of you. Do not lie about this.  
Master&ndash;Am I, hideous?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not at all.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Not one bit.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
What?  
But, I mean... When I transform...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I transform into a hideous dragon.  
I thought it might be a hideous sight...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's so reliable.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's so cool.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
&ndash;My, how cruel!  
You certainly are not lying...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Ah...ha, ahahahahaha!  
Me? Reliable and cool?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Those are not words of praise for a maiden!  
You are such a cruel Master!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
But, I'm fine with it.  
I can't stand a lie&ndash;  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
But the words of that imposter, I will turn them into lies.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
A girl&ndash;who accepted no lies and burned her love with crimson flame. I will show you just how determined that girl can be.
