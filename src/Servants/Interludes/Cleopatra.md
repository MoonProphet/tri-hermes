# Cleopatra  
  
## Where Beauty Lies  
  
**Cleopatra:**   
Hello! As ever, you have that sad puppy look on your face, Master!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
But that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, after all. Everything is!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Besides, it's the common crossbreed pups with that doe-eyed sad look who stop passersby at the pet shop windows.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Too many expensive breeds with bright eyes and shining coats could intimidate people passing by!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
That's why you shouldn't feel ashamed and actually be proud of being a hot ticket item.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
After all, no matter how much you flail about,  
you can never change the essence of who you are.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
O-okay... To be honest, I do not really understand what you're saying.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But anyway... Welcome, Cleopatra.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You are quite the beauty today, as usual.  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Tee hee. I tire of such praise.  
You're only stating the obvious, you know.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
But at least you never fail to acknowledge those around you. Let's go eat some fruit together later.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hello.  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
You have the gall to address me like a mere friend!? I should be adored like the queen that I am! This is a disgrace that I, Cleopatra VII, have never experienced!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Such disrespect! And yet how refreshing! Whatever should I do!? What kind of reward would you like, for offering such new experience to me!?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
So, Cleopatra, we seldom see you around here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What brings you here today?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...?  
But you just mentioned my reason for being here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wha...?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...(Sigh) I suppose I'll have to spell it out for you, won't I?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
As a special favor to you, I'll explain everything.  
Clear as day.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Listen. It's been quite a while since I was summoned here.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Right.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I use your fighting technique all the time.  
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
But I realized that I had forgotten something crucial.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
It's something that should have been done much earlier, and I feel that failing to do so has caused certain complications to arise.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...What is it?  
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
... You do realize that you summoned me, the ultimate beauty of the world, Cleopatra VII Philopator, right?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
And thus, I am able to make time, without any warning, and without opening up anyone's schedule and do this...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Which means, there's only one thing to do...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
We must have a photo shoot!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I'm sorry, Cleopatra.  
I don't quite follow...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
What was unclear in what I said?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I can't imagine I need to explain what a photo shoot is, do I?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I do not visit Master's room that often...so I wish to immortalize this moment with a photo shoot!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
If you still don't understand now, then you will just have to come and see for yourself.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Now come, Master.  
It's time to head out!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
A professional photo shoot obviously requires a talented photographer. We must first recruit a cameraman!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, wait, Cleopatra!  
Cleopatra!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There's no use arguing. Let's go.  
   
**Mash:**   
...I suppose we can't just leave her alone like this.  
Who knows what she has in mind, though...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All right, Senpai. After you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's play along. Sounds like fun.  
   
**Mash:**   
Fun...? Do you think so...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Either way, we can't just leave Cleopatra to her devices. All right, Senpai. After you.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
You should be honored. You have been selected as the gifted artisan who will immortalize my beauty!  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I'm terribly sorry, Georgios.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sure Cleopatra's beautiful, wonderful greeting has you so dumbfounded that you've just stopped in your tracks, and can think of nothing to say.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Allow me to explain what she was talking about.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She is asking you to be her photographer, Georgios.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Well, if it isn't Master and Mash.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
I see...so you seek my talent.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
If that is what you require, I'd be happy to accept...  
But I was actually on my way to the Saints' Club...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Saints' Club?  
  
  
---  
   
**Georgios:**   
As the name entails,  
it is a meeting of the saints here in Chaldea.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
There's no official agenda, but I believe there is a purpose for me in joining such a club.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Yes... For example, should a saintly woman with excessive strength start shadow boxing all of a sudden...  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Or should a mysterious, saint-like individual from the Far East chuckle menacingly...  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Or if a precocious young saint asks where babies come from...  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Or if a dark saintly woman who shows contempt for sainthood mistakenly gets captured on film...  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
When such a time comes, I will need to be present.  
Oh, my Lord...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-you seem to have it tough...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Then this is exactly the time you're waiting for!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Unlike that obscure and unfulfilling labor that you mentioned, the job that I am requesting you to do is quite simple. Rewarding. Coveted, in fact.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
In better times, my worshippers (read: fans) would have desired even the tiniest reminder of my beauty to keep and gaze upon lovingly in their homes...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
And they would have gladly waited in long lines carrying their expensive memory-preserving machines that were purchased with their life savings!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
As I said, you are being freely offered this great honor. You have no cause to hesitate!  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Yes, but I am not hesitating.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
I have prior commitments, and who knows what kind of hellish scene the Saints' Club may be without me there.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Ungh... He cannot seem to grasp my simple logic. Even a child would have understood. He really must not know a thing about beauty.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
He must have lived an abstentious life, which led to him forgetting what it even means to love beauty.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
So obsessed with sainthood.  
How sad...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, he IS a saint...  
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
It's fine.  
I have found our directive.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
The reason why this man is not accepting the honor of being my photographer is because he is a sad, sad man who does not appreciate beauty.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
In order to regain such appreciation, words will not suffice. Rather, he needs a shock to his system to free him of his silly notions.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Yes...yes. If that is what is needed,  
then we have no choice.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I shall personally beat an appreciation of beauty into this man! My own beauty knows no parallel, after all!  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
...Mm, what do you mean by “personally”?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Georgios!  
What is that expression on your face!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It looks like he's imagining something unsaintly!  
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Hm? What do you mean, “unsaintly”? I was just going to show that nincompoop what beauty is with my body...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
There...there is absolutely no way I would have shown my skin to a man I do not love!!!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
People may have called me a seductress who manipulated men to further her country's interests...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
But I did what I did because I fell in love with all those handsome men!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...Ahem. I digress.  
It's hard to convey your true feelings to others...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Let's try this again, without any misunderstandings.  
Let's demonstrate with actions, not with words.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Basically, I'm going to beat a sense of beauty back into you myself!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Brace yourself, saintly photographer!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Cleopatra:**   
You'll take the job? You said you'll take the job, right? Ohoho, you should have said so from the get-go!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Are you sure about this?  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Yes. If she needs me that much, I cannot refuse.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
To be honest, her dazzling form was quite blinding.  
In fact, I was nearly blinded several times.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Georgios...does that mean...are you actually blind now...?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What about the Saints' Club?  
  
  
---  
   
**Georgios:**   
I've arranged it so that King David will be there as a special guest.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
He has many moving stories to tell. He has the power to make his listeners go into a trance. So he should be able to carry the meeting for now.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
How the other saints will listen and react to King David's story is intriguing in itself...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But everything has been arranged.  
Now let us head to this photography session...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
(Gasp!)  
No, I forgot one other crucial detail!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Now what!?  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
The background! There is absolutely no way we are doing a shoot in this dingy cave!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...Actually, I wonder why the Saints' Club meets in a place like this. But let's leave that aside for now.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's about the shooting site, isn't it?  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Exactly. Of course my Master could figure that out.  
I want a photo shoot to match a Hollywood star!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
If my beauty is to be preserved in a photo,  
there must also be a suitable background!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
So there you have it. Let's continue our Rayshifting in search of the perfect background for the shoot!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Mash, go ahead with the preparations!  
If you're shorthanded, use all of Chaldea's staff!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
There's no need to pay them extra for this!  
The privilege of looking upon me is reward enough!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Oh, but my bright and dazzling form will cause some of the staff to go blind. I guess I would have to offer them extra pay to compensate them.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Why can't she just agree to pay them part-time wages?)  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, basically everything she's doing just shouts “Cleopatra”...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway, it appears that I need to make some preparations.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm going to grin and bear it and help out in Cleopatra's photo shoot!  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Georgios:**   
Hm. Now that I've connected the instant photo processing device specially made by Da Vinci...  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Okay. Not bad. Here's how it turned out...  
What do you think?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Hmmm. Not...terrible... Maybe it's that I'm alone...maybe it'll be different when we do the shoot for real...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She seems to be muttering about something. I think she's being particular at something, but I can only imagine how high her standards must be.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Master?  
Come over here. Next to me.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Yes. Direct your face over there...just like that. Got it? Now don't move. Come on, photographer, take it now!  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Moving on to taking the two of you? Understood.  
Three, two, one... Say “cheese.”  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
What do you think?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Honestly, it's bad.  
One subject totally outshines the other.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(I'm sorry...)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(This is what happens when an ordinary Masterpairs up with the world's greatest beauty...)  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
N-no, I don't think that's true!  
I like this photo...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So there's no need to be so disappointed...!  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
If the client is not satisfied, I fail as a photographer.  
I can retake as many as needed.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
We obviously need a reshoot.  
Maybe the background just isn't working.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
If the photo's not turning out right even after so many takes, maybe we're just in the wrong place. Let's head to a different location!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Unacceptable! You say there's something lacking, but I say EVERYTHING'S lacking!  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Ugh...!  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
I may be able to retaliate should the comment just be an emotional outburst, but this is coming from a pharaoh who left her mark on history.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Even I know that this photograph does not accentuate the subject matter to its true potential.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
I cannot call myself a photographer and say this is my best work!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Those two are very serious.  
It's like a heated battle of some sort.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's fine, but why do I need to be in the photos?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
(The question is whether Master's psyche can withstand every photo that gets criticized.)  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Now, I would like to do another shoot,  
but we're starting to lose the light.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Isn't there anything you can do?  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
I never imagined that this photo session would take so long...and go to so many different places...  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
This problem would be solved if we just had a reflector, but I didn't bring one this time.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
This oversight is absolutely my fault.  
I'm terribly sorry.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Reflexer?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
No, Master. He means a reflector,  
a device that redirects light...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
During a photo shoot, it can adjust the intensity and direction of the subject's lighting.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I hear that photographers have many uses for them.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
It's exactly as Mash explained.  
What I need right now is a white reflector.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Hm. Maybe I should go back and retrieve it...  
Well, some white cloth might get the job done, but...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A white cloth... Is there one around here?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry, I don't have one, either.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There couldn't be one just conveniently lying around...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-you're...!?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
...A-ahem.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
I am...a mysterious...Medjed-looking...being.  
You...two. Come...here...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
A-am I dreaming!?  
Is a life-sized Medjed talking to me!?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...And where are you taking Master and Mash!?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Are you going to give just the two of them some kind of special protection or something!? I'm almost jealous!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ummm, what are you doing here, Nito&ndash;  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Shhhh!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
...(Whisper, whisper)...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
O-okay. You're saying that even though you prepared a swimsuit, you couldn't go swimming much in it...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And so you came here to this beach to try to make use of that swimsuit...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But that's not a very regal thing to do, so you don't want us to let Cleopatra know you're here.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
And so...right now...I am not...this Nito-something. Under...stand?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-yes...so you just want us to keep this a secret. Understood.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Now that I think back,  
Cleopatra wasn't around during the summer races...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wasn't she on her honeymoon?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wasn't she stalking Caesar?  
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Hey, over there!  
How long are you going to be chatting behind my back?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
It would be nice if you would introduce me to this person with the exceptionally godly aura!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
I...am. Just a...god...who's passing...by.  
Nice to...meet you...Cleopatra...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
My...what wonderful manners!  
And it is quite knowledgeable.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
But then, it is the great Medjed!  
I knew you would know my name...!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Oh...this is the first time I've spoken with the great Medjed, so I'm a bit nervous!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
My heart is racing like the first time I met Caesar... Could this be...love...?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Ugh...but the great Medjed possesses beauty that could even stand alongside my own unabashed!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I mustn't take a photograph now...not with such greatness present. I know better than to show disrespect before a god.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
By...the way. What...were you...doing?  
Photo...graph...?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You see...  
  
  
---  
   
**Georgios:**   
...That's what happened.  
These are the photos we have taken so far.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Unfortunately, none of these have met with my client's satisfaction.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Hm...I...see...  
  
   
**D：???:**  
...  
  
   
**D：???:**  
I see...what her...intent...her purpose...is.  
Then...I shall...assist...  
  
   
**D：???:**  
If you need...something white...I can...be...of help...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
The great Medjed is going to act as a reflector!?  
We are not worthy!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
But this may be what is necessary to make my special photo shoot worthy! Ah, what a conundrum!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
How...ever...  
It comes...with a...price.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Show me...your beauty...  
Do so...and I will...help.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
I'm thrilled that you will help us out, but...whatever do you mean?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That is a fair question.  
Let me ask. U-um...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
“Look at me. If I helped freely, appreciation of the great Medjed would diminish.”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...That was Medjed's response.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I see. I understand.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
This is a trial. I am being given a divine revelation saying I am to receive the blessings of Medjed, and that I shouldn't be satisfied with my current state, and that I must continue pursuing beauty further!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...Then I shall happily undertake this trial!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Georgios:**   
If you would, please move a bit more to the right.  
Yes, right there. The lighting is just perfect.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Now here we go. Say “cheese.”  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait, how come I'm in this picture, too?  
  
  
---  
   
**Georgios:**   
Hm, what do you think?  
I believe this is one of our best yet.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Yes. There's nothing wrong with the photo.  
But...  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
You're still not satisfied?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
No... You know what, we should try thinking about this differently.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
If we're not getting the result we want even after all these attempts, it means we're not lacking something... But maybe there's something...conflicting...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
The issue is...pinpointing what exactly it is.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe it's because I'm in it...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe it's better if it's just Cleopatra...  
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Nonsense. If that were true, there would be no point in this endeavor in the first place.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
The key...is...the point...of this...endeavor...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Yes. You're right.  
Great Medjed, you read me like a book.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
We should have never tried to match the background to me.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
The most beautiful subject in this photo is undoubtedly me, but I should not be the photo's focus.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Huh?  
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Then I will focus on matching the background with the main subject. Let me ask you, Master.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
What backdrop do you think would be the most fitting for you?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, I didn't think it was going quite this way...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But I believe you just have to think of the most fitting place for a photo shoot, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Where would that be?  
I will go wherever you like.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hmmmm, let's see...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Eh? This is Chaldea's Command Room...  
Here?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course. Let's take it with everyone else too.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
If you insist, then I don't mind letting the other staff members join in. But why here?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm here thanks to everyone's efforts.  
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
So that's why you think this is the most fitting backdrop for you. ...Well, that's fine.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Then let's see how this one goes. I want everyone to get closer to the middle, closer to Master.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Yes. That's it. Here we go...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Let me see how it turned out.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...I see.  
So this is how it was supposed to be.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
This is fine.  
I believe it turned out splendidly.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I inadvertently got into the picture next to Senpai, too...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But it looks like this photograph has finally satisfied Cleopatra.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Yes. I'm satisfied. Now take a look at this picture,  
Master. Now do you understand?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
About, what?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm sorry I still don't understand...  
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...Do I have to spell everything out for you?  
Don't you get it?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
This is a picture that encapsulates my eternal beauty, alongside you...who are also beautiful.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Weren't you always saying that it was ill-matched the whole time?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I was never talking about the matchup between Master and me.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
My captivating beauty, and while [♂ his /♀️ hers} could never be a match for mine, my beautiful Master...and a background that embraces the two subjects.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
That was what was badly matched.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Eh? But I don't think I'm beautiful...  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...No, Senpai. If you look at that photograph, Cleopatra and I are both in agreement.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This photograph taken in the Command Room with you, Cleopatra, and all the staff...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Everyone's smiling...and in the center of all that, you're smiling, too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not able to properly put it into words, but the photo has a very warm feel, and it's dazzling.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
You've always been like that, Master.  
From the moment you summoned me, to be exact.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
But...it seemed like you yourself didn't realize it.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
And so I thought, if you had just one photograph of yourself standing beside me, you would realize just how beautiful you are...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
And yes, you would understand.  
That's what I thought.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Hm... So you went through all this trouble just so you could make Master realize that.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Not exactly. That was just the process.  
What I truly want to tell Master is beyond that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
???  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
You said it right from the beginning, Mash.  
I rarely visit My Room. And that's the problem.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
What I mean is...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
WHY DON'T YOU INVITE ME OVER MORE OFTEN?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Yes, it seems Master is afraid of me, or is keeping [♂ his /♀️ her}  
distance from me out of reverence.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
It's true that I am a beautiful pharaoh. There is obviously a great disparity between our ranks, so being somewhat intimidated is understandable.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
But that should not matter.  
Take a look at the photograph once again.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
You can see the beautiful Cleopatra and...and the less beautiful, but still very beautiful Master.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
So, you should have more confidence! At the very least, know that I have absolute confidence in myself.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Which means...no matter how plain they look or how boring they act, a human who is able to summon someone as beautiful as me must surely be beautiful!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's...true. Self-centered and maybe unfounded, but true, Cleopatra...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But I think the thought behind it is meant to be complimentary to Master...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Or rather, now that I think back,  
perhaps it's always been that way...?  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Hm. A truly noble beauty like her may only be able to compliment people...  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
...in roundabout ways that are bound to sometimes lead to misunderstandings.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Listen, Fujimaru. I know very well that you're the plainest of all plain people.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
But the mere fact that you are my Master gives you a leg up over all the other boring people out there.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
That's why you don't have to be so afraid of me, and should interact with me more. I may even listen to some of your requests, too.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Of course, this all assumes that you show the utmost reverence and respect for my beauty!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Now, is there something you'd like to ask of me? Why don't you grovel at my feet and beg a favor like the powerless human you are?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Ultimately, I believe she wanted to let you know that she wants you to rely on her more.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Teehee. I guess that's the only way she could convey such a sentiment.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, got it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I feel like we're closer now.  
  
  
---  
   
**E：???:**  
Yes. Hearing that from you...  
  
   
**E：???:**  
While I'm not even close to being as capable as she is, and though saying this may be overstepping my boundaries, I'm relieved.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
She can be difficult and may be misunderstood quite often...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Oh? I thought I heard a familiar voice...  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Getting...along...beautiful...  
My job...here...done...  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Farewell...  
May the pharaoh...be blessed...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Oh! Great Medjed! Please wait! Even I acknowledge your form as the embodiment of beauty!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Actually, I love you, so I want a photo!  
Can I take a picture with you!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Teehee... Until now, perhaps I was keeping my distance from Cleopatra.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
After all, she's a queen, the world's most beautiful woman, and a pharaoh.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But after this ordeal, I feel like I understand her a little more.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She may have odd ways of saying things,  
but she still lets those she approves of know it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In some ways, she's quite fair.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She believes her standards are absolute, and never compromises. She's a pure, strong-willed person.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That may be what makes her the ultimate beauty.  
  
  
## Where the Heart Is  
  
**Cleopatra:**   
...The ideal body! That is what I seek!!!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Indeed, has there ever been anyone in history who has not endeavored to sculpt their body into a monument to absolute physical perfection?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Of course not! And that's why we're here!  
Is that clear, Master!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
C-crystal?  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
No! I can tell your heart isn't in this!  
I don't need hollow reassurances!!!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The ideal body...  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
That's right. The ideal body.  
Do you know what I mean?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...No, I can see you don't.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
(Sigh)...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
So I have to explain this whole thing again, do I?  
Well, I won't! Besides, as my secretary, you should already know what I mean!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
You only get to be a pharaoh's secretary because you truly understand them!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Now, begin the preparations!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Preparations?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
To help me get in shape, obviously!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
You have my permission to activate the simulator!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
After all, there is no better way to get in shape than exercising, and there is no exercise more effective or beautiful than my Pharaoh Fighting Style!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I already practice for an hour every morning to maintain my looks and my health, of course, but that's not the same as using it in live combat.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Which is why now is the time for live combat!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...Or at least, it would be, if something would attack us. (Sigh) Where's a pack of marauders when you need them?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Anyway, since I can't count on actual enemies to invade in accordance with my workout schedule, I decided to compromise and use the simulator with some help from other Heroic Spirits here.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I trust you understand all that now?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
More or less!  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Good! That was a beautiful answer!  
Now, let us be on our merry way!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What if someone's already using the simulator?  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Oh, right. I hadn't thought of that... Well, if that turns out to be the case, that will just mean fate has chosen to aid me by providing me with an opponent!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...Yes?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I was just using the simulator to check up on my battle summons...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Is there a reason you came all this way?  
I don't want to be rude...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...but couldn't you just set the simulator the way you want for your own training?  
Cleopatra, what are you&ndash;  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
No. No, Pharaoh Nitocris.  
No more words.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
What I need right now is not talk, but exercise. Hard, strenuous, fat-burning exercise! I can't possibly get that from mere NPCs.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Now go on, don't hold back. Hit me with your best shot! On my honor as pharaoh, I can take whatever you throw at me!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
(Sigh)... All right, if you insist...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...Are you sure about this, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's okay. Please spar with her.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm her secretary right now, so whatever she says, goes.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Nitocris:**   
V-very well then. I'll admit, fighting another Servant should help with my own training too!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
All right, here goes!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...Come forth, my armies of the dead! Come forth from my mirror, and show my enemies the power of a pharaoh!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Cleopatra:**   
Phew! Not bad!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
But, it still seems like something's missing...  
You weren't holding back, were you, Pharaoh Nitocris?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
No, I was taking it fairly seriously.  
But I see that wasn't enough for you.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Hmm, I'm afraid not! Between this place and the minions you summoned, this just wasn't what I needed!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
This is not what I had in mind for my ideal exercise routine. Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I know. You want to try a different place?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You want to try the next area in the simulator?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Right!  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Paracelsus:**   
Well now. I certainly didn't expect to see you here.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
What's that? You're looking for combat training partners? I see.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
In that case, perhaps my homunculi and golems would do the trick? I was just trying my hand at some automata as well.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Very well. It will be interesting to see how much of a sweat these creatures can help me work up.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
All right, come at me!  
I'll take you all on and look beautiful doing it!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Cleopatra:**   
...Well, they were certainly worthy opponents, but I'm afraid they just aren't beautiful enough for my tastes.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Hmm... Finding the ideal exercise routine is a lot more difficult than I expected...  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Cleopatra, last of the pharaohs, I apologize that my creations failed to meet your expectations.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
No, it's all right.  
I am the one who should apologize.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Forgive me for simply moving on without properly rewarding you for your efforts.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I'll make it up to you by throwing you the finest banquet you will ever see. Oh, I'll have to invite Pharaoh Nitocris too.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Now then...  
Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yup, I know.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Time for the next area?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Come, let us be on our way!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Cleopatra:**   
That was most satisfying. Just what I would expect from an area modeled after my own Egypt.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
But, I'm afraid it all feels a bit too familiar.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
They were certainly strong enough opponents, but it just wasn't quite exciting enough to really make my skin glow!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...This really is difficult, isn't it?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I guess the ideal workout, and the ideal body aren't things that can be obtained overnight...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
But I'm not going to give up! Not after I've already come so far! Right, Master!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're definitely not one to give up, that's for sure.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
On to the next area then?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Yes! This time, I'm going to find what I'm looking for!  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Cleopatra:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
This is...the ocean.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...Why am I doing all this?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Why am I putting myself through so much strenuous exercise? Why couldn't I be satisfied with Pharaoh Nitocris's workout, or the desert's?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I'm sure those questions have crossed your mind at least once or twice, my secretary.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Why am I working so hard to improve a body that is already perfect?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I don't blame you for wondering. You must find it more intriguing than any of the Seven Wonders of the World. I doubt even that famous detective could understand.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
The truth is&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're looking for the ideal body, right?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Is this about Caesar?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Hehe, you really don't understand.  
I don't blame you.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
But my search for the ideal body is not for me.  
I seek it for another.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Namely&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Caesar?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Uh, y-yes, that's right.  
...Wait...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Ho-how did you know!?  
Are you some kind of genius!?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I knew you were a hard worker, Master, but I didn't think you were actually one of the greatest sages of all time... You might even be wiser than Diogenes.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
A-ahem. I suppose it is obvious by now, but yes, you're right.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
This is all for my darling Caesar.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
The ideal workout routine is not to help me achieve an ideal body, but to help Lord Caesar slim down!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
What sort of arduous battle will best ensure he gets into shape?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
That's why I've been going to such great lengths...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...And now (sigh) I've ended up at the ocean. A virtual ocean that can't possibly lead back to Alexandria.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You really want him to lose weight that badly?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't you love him just the way he is?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...This isn't just about looks.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Though that's not to say looks aren't part of it! They're super important, you know! But I never chose my dear Caesar for his looks alone!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...It's my son, Caesarion.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
My child who faced down Rome all on his own,  
and died just a few days after me.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
The true last pharaoh ever to walk the earth.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I...I want my dear Caesar to accept him as his rightful son and heir...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...and to do so in the same beautiful body he possessed on that fateful day.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I know it's too late to change history. I know the past will stay the past, no matter what he says now.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
But, even so...I still want him to say it.  
Both for my beloved son's sake, and for my own pride.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
It's the only way my son and I will ever be able to rest in peace...  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Are you sure that's what you want?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Wouldn't being at peace mean that you would no longer have the need to materialize in the present world?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Lord Caesar!?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
You've finally found a Master you trust enough to accompany you wherever you choose to go.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Do you really want to throw that beautiful bond away just because of something I said?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I...!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Oh, Caesar! Please don't say things like that. I just had this idea when I was washing my face this morning!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Please don't make me second-guess my amazingly beautiful decision to see it through now.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh, yeah, we can't have that...  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
No, we can't! I'm reminded yet again of just how very good Caesar is with words!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I get ideas when washing my face all the time too.  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Exactly! They just...come to you, as though they were a revelation from the heavens or something!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Caesar:**   
(Hmm, you really are second-guessing yourself now.  
Ahh, what a good woman you are.)  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
(Being around you makes me want to be a better person, and that is no mean feat. But right now, love of my life, I must bite the bullet and tell you what you need to hear.)  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Cleopatra, Master there is the only person you have ever known that you are willing to accept as your secretary.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Unlike us, you two had no existing bond to speak of.  
It was destiny that brought you two together.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I promise, I'm not going anywhere. So I urge you to cast your mind back and remember once again.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Surely you don't need to hurry to your death so quickly, do you? Yes, when you were alive, your beautiful light was snuffed out all too soon...  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
...but does that mean you must do the same now?  
No, it absolutely does not!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Lord Caesar...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I didn't know you cared so deeply for me...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Or for Master...!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
That is why, my beloved Cleopatra...  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
...I will never lose weight!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
That is all. Master, I will allow you to continue to shine bright by my Cleopatra's side.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I understand the bond you share is special,  
and not at all akin to cheating. So I will allow it!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
In turn, my dear Cleopatra...I trust you will allow me a little freedom of my own.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
My eye may wander juuust a bit from time to time, but that's not cheating either. Really. I'm talking just a teeensy little bit of ogling.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Hell no!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Curses!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
That request would be enough to ruin a romance that lasted a hundred years, but fortunately, my determination stretches back over two thousand years!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
It may have taken approximately two thousand and one hundred years, but at last, your time has come! Prepare to die, Lord Caesar! And to finally lose some weight as well!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
   
Never!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
That's the one thing you refuse to back down on, is it! Well, there are some things I won't compromise on, either!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Master! My secretary! I'm fairly tired after all that exercising, so it's time for the FP Fighting Style!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Don't look at me like you have no clue what FP stands for! It stands for “Final Pharaoh,” of course!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Fortunately, my makeup is already perfect for a beachside backdrop! Are you ready to shine bright with me, Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ready!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll shine as bright as I possibly can!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Very well then... Let us begin!!!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Caesar:**   
I-impossible...!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I can't believe you saw through my golden sword!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Hmm, maybe you do have a point. As impressive as my swordsmanship is, my body does limit how I can employ it.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Well done, Cleopatra.  
And, Master? If I may make one last request?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Please...take care of Cleopatra in my absence!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Ahh... Wait for me, Caesarion!  
I'm coming to join you, my son!  
  
   
**Caesarion's Voice:**   
(Uh, that's okay. I'm fine on my own. Really.)  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Wha&ndash;  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
   
N-no! No, no, no, no! Caesar is...g-gone...?  
This can't be happening...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Ahh...! Ahh, ahhh...!  
I... I...!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
What have I done!?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
   
Caesaaaaaaaaar!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
So, um, it turns out I've been here all along, but never mind that. I don't think you have any reason to worry. He didn't disappear; he just changed into his spirit form.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Besides, this is the simulator. Nobody disappears in here unless there's a really, really serious accident.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
What!? B-but, but he was shimmering and everything!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I thought the only time Heroic Spirits shimmer like that is when their Spirit Core has been destroyed and they're about to completely disappear...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Well, um, I'm guessing that's because he also has the kind of sparkling charm that you do?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Maybe just spending so much time with you was enough for it to rub off on him...? Or something like that.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I don't believe it...  
Then, this means...!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He ran off on you again.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sorry, Cleopatra! It sucks, I know.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
   
Grrrrrrrrr, I can't believe it! He was shimmering so much I just assumed he was truly disappearing!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...Well, there's no point crying about it now. Besides, pharaohs don't get discouraged. Devastatingly depressed at times, maybe, but not discouraged. Besides, that was a long time ago.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Anyway, Caesar was right about at least one thing.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Master... My very first secretary.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Now that I've promoted you to such an esteemed position, I would be a failure as a pharaoh if I didn't ensure you enjoyed each and every day you spent serving me.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Wouldn't you agree? Yes, of course you would.  
No need to answer that!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I want you to feel overwhelming joy and pride in being my secretary, and in having summoned me...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...So it's all right if you hold off on completely fulfilling my wish until you do.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Does that mean you're okay with Caesar not losing weight then?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Absolutely not!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
That is an entirely separate issue!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Now then, let us go for a walk on this beach until the sun has set! In fact, we should call Mash and have her join us as well. Oh, and Pharaoh Nitocris!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Yes?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I would like to demonstrate the glory of the Double Pharaoh sparkle to my secretary. I trust you don't mind!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Ah... Must I?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I. Trust. You. Don't. Mind?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
(Sigh) Fine, fine. If you insist.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Wonderful! I knew you would understand,  
queen of the heavens!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Very well then...first, I'll need to change into a swimsuit. The finest swimsuit ever made that is sure to suit me per&ndash;  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Oh, in that case, I have an idea. Why don't you try this Medjed outfit made with a new kind of&ndash;  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
No, thank you! I don't have the courage to wear something imitating Lord Medjed!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
At this moment...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
   
(Shock)  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...I'm looking for something on the cutting edge of fashion, such as an outfit from Paris Fashion Week!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I always shine bright in all my endeavors,  
and that's not about to change anytime soon!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Now, let us all be on our way!
