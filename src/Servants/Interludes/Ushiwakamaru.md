# Ushiwakamaru  
  
## Love is Not Free  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Yawn... Good morning Master!  
What's wrong?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where are we?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Now that you mention it... That is strange.  
Did the Rayshift fail?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Where are Mash and Fou?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Over here.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Mash, Fou!  
I'm glad you're safe!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Are you hurt?  
If something happened to you, Master would be sad.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Nnn, kyu.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm fine.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...It seems there was an accident during Rayshift.  
Please wait while I ask the Doctor to bring us back.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry everybody. I don't know what happened, but I have your signals here.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There's no data on where you jumped, but it's spatially stable.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Give me a minute.  
Once the repairs are done, I'll bring you back.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Understood! Master, I'll go look and make sure there's no danger!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Actually, we should stick together.  
Is that all right with you, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No problem.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's do that.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Okay!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, Ushiwakamaru, watch yourselves.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I-I'm fine... Hyaaah!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I-I'm sorry. Thank you! I was raised by the Kurama Tengu and I still slipped...  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Still, this forest&ndash;  
It seems different than the one in my country.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right. From the look of that coast...  
Are we on a deserted island?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
You're probably right, Mash.  
There's likely no land bridge.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
If we're trapped here, should we chop some wood and make a raft?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If we can Rayshift back, we probably won't need a raft.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Too bad.  
I'm quite good at chopping wood&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What's wrong?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
&ndash;Be quiet.  
I sense an evil presence.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Me too.  
Fou, be quiet.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Kyu.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
...  
S-Sorry.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Fou's so cute, I feel like my heart skipped a beat.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
The presence&ndash;is starting to approach.  
Master, shall we launch a surprise attack?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's do that.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Got it.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Right, I'll go around the side.  
Mash, you intercept them.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wow... Her "Presence Concealment" is Assassin level.  
Let's do this, Master stand back.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Here they come!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I trapped them!  
Let's go!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Whew! That was good exercise!  
By the way, can we eat them?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Probably not a good idea to eat the Lamia...  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
A shame. If you carefully drain them of blood, snakes can be quite delicious.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I used to eat them all the time during war.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I see...  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
This island is pretty small, huh?  
Doesn't look like there's much to see.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
...A bit of a shame, really.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, hello? It's the Doctor. It's going to take me a little longer to adjust the Rayshift.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's just refusing to stabilize...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. ...I'm sorry.  
Looks like it will take a bit more time.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Anyway Master, I want to hear a story about you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
About me?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Is it strange to want to know about one's Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm boring.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm not interesting...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
No, I want to learn about you, Master.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I might not be the best listener, but I'll try my hardest. So please, go ahead!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
...I see, I see.  
Thank you, Master!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
...Looks like the Rayshift's not ready yet.  
It's so quiet.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
...  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Master, um...  
I have a question&ndash;  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Am I useful to you?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Obviously.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I see. Glad to hear it. I...I'm used to people telling me they don't understand me.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
When I tell them I want to fight for someone else's sake, they all seem confused.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Is my reason that strange?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I fought for my brother's sake, but he never believed me, even until the end.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
It's true that there were misunderstandings, but I never thought of hurting him even once&ndash;  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I'm not angry. It's just strange to me.  
Why can't people understand how I feel?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I'm sorry. This isn't something I should be talking about with you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't worry about it.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I want to hear more.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
...You're a lot like Ise Yoshimori, you know?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Oh, I don't mean that you look like him.  
He had a face like a wicked fox.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
But he was easy to talk to.  
About serious things, or just joking around.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
You have many Servants. But you take time to talk to them one-on-one&ndash;  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
It's a little embarrassing, but I'm very grateful.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is it ready? Doctor?  
I think it's time for us to go back&ndash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, sorry.  
I have bad news.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Go ahead with the bad news, Dr. Roman.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Just so we're clear, this isn't my fault, okay?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Until you can stabilize that area, even if you try to return, you'll just end up somewhere else.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The cause of the instability circles around the island. Any ideas?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Around the island?  
Could it be&ndash;that ship?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I thought it might be a ship... Yeah.  
I'm picking up magical energy coming from it.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Can you go there and remove the source of the instability?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I think so.  
Let's jump aboard when it gets close.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-At this distance?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Mash, I once jumped across eight ships.  
This is nothing.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
...I think it's about time. Mash, once I'm aboard I'll bring the ship close.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Just watch me. Master, take this&ndash;  
"Dan-No-Ura Eight-Boat Leap!"&ndash;Here I go!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
S-She jumped!  
She jumped over eight boats in length!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I did it! Okay guys, sorry!  
But I'm taking this boat to shore!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I promise I won't kill you&ndash;  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I won't kill you&ndash;  
Oh, no! They're already dead!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
U-Um, Ushiwakamaru seems to be having a hard time!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's wait and believe.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She'll be fine.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I'm getting this boat to shore&ndash;  
Tch, get out of my way!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Okay, got it! Mash!  
I'm turning the boat around!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's getting closer.  
At this range I can do it too&ndash;!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ushiwakamaru!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Oh, Mash!  
Sorry, it took me a while!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see. It was a ghost ship!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
U-Um, Mash?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Was Master disappointed?  
It did take me a while...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Don't worry.  
Master believed in you.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I see!  
Okay, then nothing can stop me!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Come, you ghastly creatures!  
My name is Minamoto&ndash;No, Ushiwakamaru!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
As a Servant of Fujimaru,  
I shall defeat you!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Yup, that's most of them.  
Master! Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Wave to her.)  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Good job!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Mash!  
Master praised me!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm so happy for you, Ushiwakamaru!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Right!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hey guys, the readings from that ghost ship isn't totally gone.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If you don't hurry up, you won't be able to come home.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Huh? Really?  
But&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't see anything else...  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
A mist? Rising from the bodies?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see, the vengeful spirit driving the ship was the source of the instability!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
&ndash;Okay Mash, this time let's finish it.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Evil is destined to fall.  
Especially, wicked demons...  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Your grudge shall be slain by me  
&ndash;Ushiwakamaru!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I defeated them!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay, you all can come home now.  
Let me know when you're ready.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood.  
Let's meet with Master first.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Master, I have slain the vengeful spirits!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
It's a shame you couldn't see me since we were fighting on the decks...  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
But next time, I promise to fight somewhere you can see!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
And um...well.  
If you wouldn't mind...  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Oh, no...  
Never mind, I guess...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is it?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
D-Do you think you could maybe pat me on the head?  
I'd really like that.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sure.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Thank you!
