# Valkyrie  
   
## Die Walküre  
   
**Thrúd:**   
I think you have to go with  
“Want to come back to my place?”  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Oh yeah, that's totally the right move!  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
True, we could talk a lot if they were willing to come back to my place. But, I don't know if I'm comfortable with proposing that myself...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Why not? They say love is war, and in war, whoever makes the first move has a clearer path to victory.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Yup! You can't have a victory without a battle first!  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
True... B-but then again, this isn't actually a war.  
This is a video game meant to simulate dating.  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
So I'm not sure the usual rules of warfare are necessarily the way to go in this case...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...Wh-what do you think, Tomoe Gozen?  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
Ahh, this tea is so good.  
Hm? Did you say something?  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
Ahh, I see. Branching dialogue. Personally, I believe choosing whichever option sounds best to you is the way to go...  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
...but I have also heard from Lord Zhuge Liang that characters in games like these do tend to have distinct preferences.  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Well, if it's a Japanese game we're talking about, they tend to cover all the bases pretty well. What's that? A dating sim?  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Those aren't the kinds of games I usually play, but if you want my advice, I'd say make sure to get a bead on your target character's likes and dislikes.  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Honestly, it really isn't much different from gauging a battle. If the enemy has a certain inclination, all you have to do is focus on it and plan accordingly.  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
As Sun Tzu once said:  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
“If you know your enemy and know yourself,  
you will never be defeated in a hundred battles.”  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
Does that help?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
“Know your enemy...”  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
“Know yourself...”  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
“And you will never be defeated in a hundred battles.”  
No wonder he was such a revered tactician.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
He might not quite be the kind of brave warrior we're always keeping an eye out for, but he sure was a smart guy.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Know your enemy and know yourself...  
Hmm...  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
Hehe. All that aside, I never expected to have an opportunity to play with you all in the recreation room in such a manner.  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
This is wonderful! There are a number of four-player games I have been wanting to try that would be perfect to share with my three new gamer friends!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...Gamer friends?  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
Oh, did I misunderstand?  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Nah, I think you can call us your gamer friends no problem. I mean, we do hang out here all the time these days.  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
And you've been a huge help to us ever since we were summoned. Oh, please help yourself to the snacks we brought.  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
Thank you. They look delicious. Oh, where are my manners? I haven't even made you tea.  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
Oh, no, you don't have to go to any trouble for us.  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
Not at all. It's the least I can do.  
Wait right here; I'll be back in no time.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Gamer friends, huh...?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
I hadn't realized it before, but I suppose that is what we are now, isn't it?  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Well hey, considering how much we come here nowadays, it was bound to happen.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
I suppose you're right.  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
Of course she is, Thrúd.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
You know, I hadn't given it much thought until now...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...but we really have become accustomed to all three of us materializing at once, haven't we?  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
I know we do our best to keep [♂ his /♀️ her} magical energy consumption to a minimum...but there's no way we could all actually fight together like this, is there?  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
We used to take turns being summoned, but at the moment, Thrúd is the only one of us materialized in an official capacity.  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
And even though we always reintegrate into one Heroic Spirit whenever we're fighting for Chaldea on Master's behalf...  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
...having all three of us materialized the rest of the time has got to be...well...  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
...Yeah. It definitely takes a toll on Master.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
I've already talked to the technical advisor about this, but...  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
I remember. She said our simultaneous materialization wasn't having any noticeable effect on Master's vitals...  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
...and that this sort of thing isn't all that unusual at Chaldea, so it wasn't a big deal.  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
True.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Really, when you get right down to it...we still don't even know why we all want to be materialized simultaneously.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Strategically speaking, we know it's a waste of resources, and yet...  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
For some reason...  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
We all just naturally end up materializing together.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
I also tried talking to our sister in the hope that she could help us get to the bottom of this mystery, as she knows even more about being a Valkyrie than we do. But...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Utilitarianism may have its uses, but it is far from all there is to life. That is just as true for Heroic and Divine Spirits as it is for humans.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Even if our transient bodies are merely made of ether instead of flesh and bone...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...we still have things that make our fleeting existence worthwhile.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Pride. Honor. Fate. Love. We may not always know where they are, and we may sometimes stumble on the way to finding them, but they still give our lives meaning all the same.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
And since that is surely the same for all of you as it is for anyone else, I don't think there's anything mysterious about your situation at all.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Love!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
L-l-l-love...  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
O-o-oh gosh, oh gosh. Y-y-you think we're in love?  
You think we can love?  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
D-d-d-don't be ridiculous, Sister! Y-you know as well as we do that we're just automated machines the Allfather made.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Right!?  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
......  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
.........Pshhht.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Aah! Ortlinde is overheating!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Thrúd!  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Hehehe.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Ahh, this takes me back.  
You three remind me of myself when I was younger.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Sisteeer!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
After that, we tried talking to all sorts of other Servants in an effort to learn just what love truly is...  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
...but none of their answers really clicked for us.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
And that brings us to now.  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
Dating involves romance, so if these games simulate it, I think we should be able to use them to learn about love.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
I think so too. Man, humans come up with the most interesting ideas sometimes, don't they?  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Don't you agree, Thrúd?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...I see no need for me to give voice to my opinion, seeing as we synchronize our thought patterns at regular intervals.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
I know, but still... Hmm.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
At this point, we should forgo sleep in order to play this game as much as possible. Er, not that we need to sleep in the first place, of course.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Well, in for a penny, in for a pound. We might all be thinking along the same lines, but three heads are still better than one!  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
That's exactly what a famous Eastern proverb says. And it's right. With all our wisdom pooled together, there is no conundrum we can't overcome.  
  
   
**Valkyries:**   
Yeah!  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
(Nnn... It seems I was right to wait before offering them tea.)  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
(Hmm, I see. So that is why they are here...)  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
...So that is the story.  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
I am happy to have new gamer friends no matter what their reasons may be, of course...  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
...but the way they are spending almost every moment of every day staring at a screen, well...  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
I could not help but worry about them...  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
It was very difficult for me to come to you about this, Master, but I am afraid I did not know what else to do.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks for telling me, Tomoe.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm glad you told me about this.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
Of course...  
  
   
**F：Voice:**   
Beautiful. I see the spark of true friendship in your concern for your peers.  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
For after all, what is friendship without regard for our fellow person's well-being?  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
I know you!  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
Forgive the intrusion, Tomoe Gozen and Master, but I couldn't help but overhear your discussion.  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
Allow me to handle this.  
For you see...  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
I have an excellent idea!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Are you all right, Master?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
I can handle a trek across a snowy mountain like this just fine since I am able to fly, but it must be much more difficult for you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't worry, I'm fine.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's okay. I'm used to walking.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Thrúd:**   
This is quite a lot of snow, even by my standards.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
This is supposed to be a recreation of the Scandinavian Lostbelt, correct?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
While all these mountains and trees made up of ice and snow are certainly beautiful to look at, I can't help but find them a jarring sight.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
That aside...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Why did we come to the Scandinavian Lostbelt?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
If you only wished to have us simulate combat for training purposes, we Valkyries could do so just as easily in our own mind space.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Of course, if you wish to have us practice coordinating with you, then I can see the value in training like this...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...but it still seems wasteful to use your precious magical energy resources on a, um, o-one-on-one session...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
I-I, um... I'm sorry, Master.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Considering how my sisters and I are forcing you to let us all materialize simultaneously, even if only during downtime, I have no right to say that...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's fine. I knew the Valkyries were a package deal going in.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't worry about it. The magical energy it takes tokeep you all around is barely a blip on the radar.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...Thank you, Master.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
The wind just picked up...  
  
   
**F：Voice:**   
Hehe.  
  
   
**F：Voice:**   
Since when do you care about the well-being of a measly human? Now you're just embarrassing yourself, puppet.  
  
   
**Red-Eyed Swordsman:**   
That aside, you sure do talk a lot for a damn doll, don't you?  
  
   
**Red-Eyed Swordsman:**   
Tell me, Valkyrie, just how far are you and your sisters going to fall over a damn human?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
It can't be...  
Surtr!?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
N-no... You aren't the Fiery King of Giants...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
You are Sigurd, the man Sister Brynhild loved!  
But... Aah!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
I know I have no records of this Lostbelt, yet every circuit in my body is telling me that when his eyes glow red, Sigurd is a threat to the very planet itself!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Your eternally burning hellfire would consume all of reality if left unchecked! Why are you here of all places!?  
  
   
**Red-Eyed Swordsman:**   
Heh. You ask me why, puppet?  
  
   
**Red-Eyed Swordsman:**   
Why? Why, you say!? Hehehehe. That is exactly the question I have for you, Valkyrie!  
  
   
**Red-Eyed Swordsman:**   
Why do you mimic your predecessor and degrade yourself by serving a human? What could you have possibly gained by doing so!?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
!?  
  
   
**Red-Eyed Swordsman:**   
Exactly. The answer is “nothing.”  
  
   
**Red-Eyed Swordsman:**   
The only thing you obsolete automata are good for is deceiving brave warriors who died nobly in battle and taking their souls with you to Valhalla.  
  
   
**Red-Eyed Swordsman:**   
No more. I will destroy you and stop you from embarrassing yourselves any longer.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Master, I don't know when or how,  
but we've been surrounded by giants!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
It is still unclear who this man is or what he wants, but it does seem clear that peaceful negotiation is no longer an option!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then we'll just have to stay calm and take them on.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's okay. We can handle them as long as we keep our cool.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...Understood.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Initiating combat routines.  
Preparing to eliminate all enemy targets.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
O Great Allfather, lend me your strength!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Yaaah!  
  
   
**Red-Eyed Swordsman:**   
Well, well!  
  
   
**Red-Eyed Swordsman:**   
Not bad spearmanship for a Valkyrie who's lost her way!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Yes, that's right! I...we, are lost!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...Before, we would have just diagnosed ourselves as broken, and asked the Allfather for repairs.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
But now, I&ndash;we, know Sister Brynhild.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Both the Allfather and Sister herself said that she was broken...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
But we hesitate to agree...  
  
   
**Red-Eyed Swordsman:**   
Oh?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
After all...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
After all, Sister Brynhild is so beautiful when she smiles like that.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
We just cannot believe that she only does so because she's broken. No...we don't want to believe it!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
That is why we remain lost! That is why we refuse to reject our own half-broken selves!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Even if, by remaining broken, we irrevocably set ourselves on a path towards oblivion...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Even if learning about love brings us nothing but a tragic, fiery death, we will still&ndash;  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
That's enough!  
  
   
**Red-Eyed Swordsman:**   
...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Sister...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Huh? Sister...Brynhild?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Yes. It's me.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...?  
  
   
**Red-Eyed Swordsman:**   
And me.  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
My dear sister-in-law, Thrúd.  
No...  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
My dear sisters, Thrúd, Hildr, and Ortlinde.  
I am overjoyed to see your resolve for myself.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...Sigurd?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
(Gasp)  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
M-M-Master! Is this about what I think it's about!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sure is!  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Oh gosh, oh gosh...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yup! I'm impressed how quickly you figured it out.  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Th-then...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
You, Sigurd, and Sister were so concerned about me&ndash;er, us...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...spending so much of our time on d-d-dating sims...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...that you decided to trick us like this?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
I'm sorry, Thrúd. I knew such a deception would be profoundly shocking for you.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
But you three have been so obsessed lately that I figured, if you didn't get it out of your system like this...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...you'd never be able to take a step back and see the larger picture.  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
As usual, Brynhild is being too modest. All she did was nod in mild agreement. The responsibility for this deception lies entirely with me.  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
Sisters, I apologize for what I said to you behind my mask. Even if the goal in doing so was ultimately to help you, I cannot deny that they were still terrible things to say.  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
I won't ask for your forgiveness. I will only ask that you direct all of your ire towards me.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Beloved...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Th-then, this must mean...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
We were acting in such a dreadful manner that we caused our dear sister to worry about us...  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
Sister. Sisters. I trust the other two of you can hear me through Thrúd?  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
I want to tell you all something very important.  
Something your sister once told me.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...?  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
Get lost!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Huh!?  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
By which I mean, if there is some piece of knowledge that remains beyond your grasp, or you are unable to find what it is you seek...  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
...then go ahead and stray away from the path you know to look for it. Go ahead and get lost in the proverbial woods.  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
You need not worry that you will lose your way forever, for Brynhild and I will always be there to stop you from going down the wrong path.  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
So let yourselves be lost. Let yourselves agonize and search for solutions as much as you need. In doing so, you will all learn and grow.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Grow...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Don't be ridiculous, Sigurd. How could we ever grow when we are nothing more than transient ether?  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
That is where you are mistaken, Sister.  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
As long as we exist in this world, regardless of what form that existence may take, we are still resolutely ourselves.  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
At least, that is how I see it.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Me too.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Same here.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think that's a fine way to look at it.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Thank you, Fujimaru.  
I'm so glad my sisters have you for their Master.  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
As am I, beloved.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Indeed.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Master...  
Sister...  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
Brynhild?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Beloved, I don't think I'll be able to hold my spear back much longer...  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
I see. Then I'd better wrap this up quick.  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
Thrúd! Hildr! Ortlinde!  
I have an order for you on Master's behalf!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Y-yes!? What is it!?  
  
   
**Sigurd:**   
No more than one hour of gaming per day!  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Begin Ortlinde's personal memory log.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
As for what happened next...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Thanks in part to Tomoe Gozen's impassioned argument that one hour per day was too short...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...we were permitted to play video games for up to two hours per day. And today...  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
Dating simulations are all well and good!  
However!  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
As Heroic Spirits, we must not neglect our feelings towards the battlefield either.  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
Which is why today...  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
...I've brought a different game for us to play!  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
This is a true masterpiece! Even Lord Tajima has given it high praise, saying it was, “Not bad.” And since it has all manner of challenge modes built-in, I think it will be right up your alleys!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
What is this?  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
It looks very Eastern.  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
Do we get to control this person with the katana?  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
In this game, you go around fighting enemies as either a samurai or a ninja. Oh, but you don't always have to fight them head-on. You may always utilize stealth kills.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Samurai! Ninja!  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
(Itching to get started)  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
I-I suppose that doesn't sound too bad. Eastern warriors can probably hold their own just fine against the Vikings.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Come on, let's try it!  
I call first life!  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
Then I'll go second.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Ah.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
I-I mean, that's fine. I am the eldest, after all, so I have no problem taking my turn last.  
  
   
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
Don't worry, it has a multiplayer mode as well!  
Hehe, come on, let's all play together!  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...We're still stumbling as we try to find our way,  
but at least we had another enjoyable day.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
By the way, Master?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I have no intention of ever letting you see this,  
but I thought I would try addressing you while I write it anyway.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
So,Master.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Why do you think we became so obsessed with dating sims in the first place?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Is it because we asked Sister Brynhild what love is?  
That is certainly the main reason.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But admittedly, it is not the only one.  
You see, we also...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
On second thought, never mind.  
Okay, see you later then.
