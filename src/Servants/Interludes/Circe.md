# Circe  
  
## Curse of the Argo  
  
**Circe:**   
...(Turns page)  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...(Munch, munch)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(What's going on here...?)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Why are Circe and Atalante lounging around on Senpai's bed...?)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Well...maybe not exactly lounging so much as relaxing...)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Circe is reading a book...and Atalante seems to be lost in some video...)  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...(Turns page)  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Holy crap, seriously...?  
What's wrong with people these days...?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...Hey, can you grab those for me?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Absolutely not. (Toss)  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Thanks!  
Man, these sticky note things are great.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Hey. What was that person's name again?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Huh? How the hell should I know?  
I'm the Queen Witch, remember?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Maybe Hermaphroditus?  
Oh, I bet it's Clytemnestra.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
That's it. I could not remember for the life of me.  
...Mm.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
What is this stuff?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Apple chips. They are quite good.  
If you eat two at once, it changes the flavor.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Oh please, don't be ridiculous.  
There's no way that could... (Munch)  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Whoa... You're right. (Munch, munch)  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Here Mash, you've gotta try these. You get a whole different flavor if you eat two at a time!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
O-okay, thank you.  
I'd be glad to try some.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Munch, crunch...)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(...I know I have no real basis for thinking this, but...)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(...is this what most teenage girls do when they spend time together?)  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...You there, witch.  
What spell tome are you reading?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
It's Queen Witch.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
What a garish cover. The cover's array of pink fluorescent hearts makes my eyes water.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
And why is it so thick?  
Is it meant to be used as a bludgeon?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Remember that weird field trip we went on the other day? I just happened to find this when we stopped by that convenience store. Hehehe!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Check out all the bonus stuff they give you with it!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Matching aprons, adorable oven mitts,  
and a selfie stick with Cupid wings!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
And...ooh, I'm sensing a lot of magical energy from this special marriage registration in the back!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I see. Good for you.  
Enjoy your reading, then.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...Circe! Get up already!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh... Hello, Nitocris.  
Thank you for helping Senpai out.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Of course. Though I must say, I didn't expect to come back to such a sad state of affairs.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
How can you still call yourself a teacher,  
wallowing about like a pig?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
It's deplorable... All the other witches from the great Age of Gods would be ashamed of you!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Ugh, lay offa me! What are you, my mother?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
O-of course not.  
M-more of a conscientious younger sister.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
At any rate, I know Medea already talked to you about this too...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...but make sure you fill out the Caster bulletin and put it back where it belongs like we asked you to!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Yeah, yeah, I got it already.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Hmph...

**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Who's turning into a pig now?  
  
  
---  
   
**Circe:**   
   
Aah! (Frenzied cleaning)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, hello, Senpai. We were just changing shifts.  
You have a break now too, right?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You okay, Circe?  
   
**Circe:**   
H-hey there, Piglet! I'm doing better than okay!  
What a coincidence, running into you here!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
If you're tired, I've got some kykeon all ready to go for an afternoon snack!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
I've also got a remedy that'll double your fatigue now but make it all go away like magic in a few days if you like.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
When are you going to figure out that administering it in small doses only ends up increasing your target's poison resistance?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Everything okay, Circe?  
   
**Atalante:**   
I believe she is panicking about being compared to all the new Greek additions that have shown up as of late.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Please do not be too harsh with her.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Stop that! Don't you look away like that just 'cause you're feeling awkward, Mash!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
H-here, Senpai, why don't you have a seat?  
I'll go make some tea.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks, Mash.  
  
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What're you watching there, Atalante?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...I couldn't help but notice you've been watching it very intently.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I also noticed you tearing up at times,  
so I wasn't sure what to say...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
O-oh... This?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
This is an old video I found in Chaldea's library.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
It is so painful to watch that it took my breath away.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
It tells the story of children still too young to attend school who are forced by their cruel parents to go on a trip to procure supplies.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
It has everything. Trials, tribulations, tears,  
twists, triumph... I could watch it forever.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Jason's journey to find the Golden Fleece was nothing compared to what these poor children endured!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's...really saying something.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Aw come on, that's not fair to Jason.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
You should know that, Atalante,  
seeing how you were one of the Argonauts.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Hmph... You have always been too soft when it comes to sailors.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
That is why you are always so put upon.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Ghh...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Haha...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Were Circe and Atalante always such good friends?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Good question.  
It does seem like they get along very well.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Did you hear that?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Well, maybe they have a point.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
We didn't have a lot of contact in our own time,  
but that might have been for the best.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't suppose you'd tell us about the time you two met?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
A story from Greek mythology?  
I'd love to hear that as well.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Hmm. A story about the good old days, huh?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I... I would rather...  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Fine with me! Anything for my darling Piglet!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Though it was nothing grand enough to be recorded in poems or stories passed down through the ages.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Let's see... Our story begins long before the Trojan War was a glimmer in anyone's eye...  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
		– Aeaea Island –  
  
   
**Piglets:**   
Oink, oiiink! (Squealing and sobbing)  
  
   
**Circe:**   
There, there. I know it hurt.  
You must've been so scared. But it's all okay now.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
Circe, tell me, what business does a famed witch have with us?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
A warning! What else!?  
Listen up, Jason, captain of the Argo!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
As long as you're staying on this island, you're free to fish anything you want from the sea, or to pick any of the fruit of this land.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
But do not lay so much as a finger on this island's animals!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Remember, this island is my domain. If you, or any of your Argonauts, should break my rules...  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...you'll be lucky to escape with your lives,  
let alone a repaired boat!  
  
   
**Jason:**   
...Duly noted.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
Damn, and here I thought I'd finally get some steak for the first time in ages... Guess it's back to wyvern jerky.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
Hey! You two!  
Put those pigs back where you found them!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Huh? Are you talking to me?  
   
**Jason:**   
That's right.  
You're Fujimaru and...Mashaea, was it?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Long time no see, Jason.  
   
**Jason:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Jason:**   
The hell're you talking about, creep?  
We just saw each other this morning.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
That goes for you too, Mashaea,  
or whatever your name was. Got it?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Mashaea? Senpai, when did we become sailors?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Does this mean we've joined Jason and become members of the Argonauts now?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
That is correct.  
Still...it is quite a shame...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Had I known what would happen,  
I would have strangled this prey on the spot...  
  
   
**Piglets:**   
O-oiiink!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
So... You're the one who set a trap for my precious piglets!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...Wait. Why would you even do that after I made some kykeon to welcome you all!?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
How stupid do you think we must be to accept a gift from the witch of Aeaea Island at face value?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Hehe, I believe you mean QUEEN Witch!  
  
   
**Jason:**   
Exactly.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
We didn't sail all this way just to have you poison us and make off with our treasure.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Hey, I wouldn't do that! For one thing, I'd never lay a hand on my own brother's treasure.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Treasure...? Do you mean the king of Colchis's most prized possession?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No way... The Golden Fleece!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Jason:**   
None other.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
After everything my crew and I have been through, you'd better believe we're going to be on our guard.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
Though I guess it's no surprise you two wouldn't know that, since you only just joined us.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...So then, we must be in the middle of the Argo's voyage to bring the Golden Fleece back from Colchis.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As I recall, during that voyage, Zeus got angry and hurled a tremendous storm at the Argo...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Correct.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Med&ndash;Queen Medea killing her younger brother, Prince Apsyrtus, was the catalyst for his wrath.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Once he learned of this crime, Zeus flew into a rage.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
He struck the Argo with lightning, battered it with great waves, and plunged it into a storm so fierce the keel was nearly torn apart.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
The only reason we managed to barely survive was my mastery of the sail and rudder...  
  
   
**Jason:**   
...as well as the courage of my loyal Argonauts.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...I expect Castor and Pollux's pleas must have reached Zeus's ears.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...So what happened to Medea?  
  
  
---  
   
**Jason:**   
She's inside the Argo's wreck over on the beach.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
She shut herself up in the cabin after she killed Apsyrtus and hasn't spoken to anyone since.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
The only exception she will make is for our rostrum oak from Dodona.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
...  
  
   
**Circe:**   
The oak from Dodona... You mean the talking wood that's only found in the land of Zeus's oracle?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
So she'd rather talk to a piece of lumber than you or your crew? Aren't you ashamed of that!?  
  
   
**Jason:**   
...Ohhh, right. Technically, you're my aunt-in-law, aren't you, Circe?  
  
   
**Jason:**   
And here I still haven't thanked you properly.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
If you're gonna call me your aunt,  
then you'd better take good care of Medea.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...I wouldn't have even let you near Aeaea Island if she hadn't been on your ship.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Zeus will eventually get over his rage,  
but the Argo will still be cursed.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
It's only a matter of time until you run into more foul weather, or get stranded somewhere else. Just look how beat-up your ship is.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
How many times have you wrecked that thing? Forget repairing it; you should just throw it away and find a new one.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
Wha...!? Don't be ridiculous!  
I can't do that!  
  
   
**Jason:**   
The Argo is my ship! It's going to guide me back to my home of Thessaly!  
  
   
**A：???:**  
...Now, now, easy there, Jason.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...?  
Who's that...?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(A young man in impressive clothing just showed up...)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Is that a human...or a demigod? Who is that?)  
  
  
---  
   
**???:**  
If you continue such drastic repairs, your ship will, in essence, become a new vessel.  
  
   
**???:**  
Should that come to pass,  
would you still call it your beloved Argo?  
  
   
**Jason:**   
Of course I could. It's the only ship worthy of being with me for my whole life.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
I won't let it go no matter what,  
not even if it gets smashed from bow to stern.  
  
   
**???:**  
Of course that's your answer.  
I suppose that is one way for a hero of the sea to live...  
  
   
**???:**  
...Now then. Circe, beautiful ruler of Aeaea Island, goddess of mercy with the wisdom and providence of Artemis...  
  
   
**???:**  
...I apologize for not introducing myself sooner.  
It is a genuine pleasure to make your acquaintance.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Oh? Well now, I can't remember the last time someone paid me the proper respects. Hehe.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
I wonder who that is?  
No...hang on...  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Those Ionian looks...  
That tropical accent...  
  
   
**Circe:**   
And that expensive himation with the pattern reserved strictly for royalty...!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
I know...who you are.  
I think I know your name, too...  
  
   
**Circe:**   
You're...the king of Athens!  
  
   
**???:**  
...Indeed I am. I'm honored that you know of me. But right now, I'm just Jason's friend and fellow Argonaut.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Well no wonder the Argo's cursed if it's got guys like you on board!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
I...I can't believe you have the guts to show your face before me, Theseus!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Theseus...!  
The heroic young king of Athens...!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He's been on board the Argo this whole time?  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I believe so.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I've heard that name before.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes... I'm sure you have, Senpai.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
He's the hero who made his way through the great labyrinth of Crete and defeated the Minotaur.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
A hero, huh... Yeah, maybe.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Theseus did help my sister, Pasiphaë,  
wrap up one of her loose moral ends.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
After he escaped from the labyrinth, I heard he took her daughter, my niece, Princess Ariadne...  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...who was, I would add, the spitting image of her mother, as his bride.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
And yet, for some reason, I haven't heard anything more about Ariadne after that happened. Not a peep.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Instead, all I've heard is how the king of Athens recently welcomed a new queen to his palace.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...Why is that, Theseus? What was so wrong with Ariadne that she couldn't be your queen?  
  
   
**Theseus:**   
...I still love Ariadne, even now.  
I'm more grateful to her than you know.  
  
   
**Theseus:**   
But unfortunately, she had no intention of bearing me an heir.  
  
   
**Theseus:**   
As a man, I could accept that choice and respect it.  
  
   
**Theseus:**   
But as the king of Athens,  
this created a problem that I had to solve.  
  
   
**Theseus:**   
Much as I wish it weren't, that is part of my kingly duty. I am so sorry.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...Ghh...  
  
   
**Circe:**   
I swear! What is it about my family that makes heroes everywhere just wanna mess with us?  
  
   
**Jason:**   
...That's enough, Theseus.  
Step down. I'm plenty calm now.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
I trust you understand why I didn't want you and Circe running into each other?  
  
   
**Theseus:**   
Yes, I do, Jason.  
I'm sorry for overstepping my bounds.  
  
   
**Theseus:**   
I'll get back to supervising repairs on the Argo.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Circe, Queen Witch, it is too soon for you to lose hope and curse us.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
You have Medea.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
She speaks of you often, and clearly has fond memories of you as her teacher.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
And right now, Medea wants nothing more than to see the Argo's voyage completed.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I know she is not here asking you for help,  
but I also know that is what she wants.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
Indeed. Atalante is absolutely right, Circe.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
So I ask you now, as the leader of the Argonauts:  
please, help us return to the sea.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
For my wife's&ndash;for Medea's&ndash;sake as much as ours.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...I guess my bloodline was just fated to be the plaything of gods and heroes alike.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I actually did not care a great deal about all of that.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I only wished that Medea's twisted romance would hurry and end, so she may find happiness again.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...So then, Circe did go on to honor Jason's request and help the Argonauts.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm impressed Jason pulled that off. Talk about a model hero.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So, that's how you shamelessly sweet talk someone intogiving you what you want. Good to know.  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
So...what happened next?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
According to myth, the Argo continued its voyage for quite some time after that, right?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Indeed. And that is exactly what happened.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
However...Circe was dead set on getting Medea to resolve the situation for herself.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
She kept trying to wake her up to the disaster she had invited and face up to it.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...At least, that is what you were trying to do, was it not?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...Yeah, it was. Not that it did any good.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
My former pupil refused to see me,  
even after I came to the Argo in person.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
She refused to open up, and wouldn't let anyone besides Jason come near her.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Honestly, I'm not even sure Jason's attempts to console her got through.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Eventually, I just ended up waving my wand to dispel the Argo's curse.  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Circe:**   
...All right, listen up, brave Argonauts.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Let's go over the dispelling ritual one more time.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
This elixir I whipped up will make ephemeral concepts corporeal for a short while.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Once you sprinkle it over the hull, it'll make its curse something you can touch&ndash;or, more to the point, hit.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
If you can defeat the curse before the elixir's effects run out, the Argo should then be free of it for good.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
But be warned: if you fail to defeat it, it'll get even stronger and come back to haunt this ship with a vengeance.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
So the curse will take the form of a monster, huh.  
I suppose it being only one monster would be too much to hope for?  
  
   
**Jason:**   
If not, that's where Theseus'll come in!  
  
   
**Jason:**   
Now that Heracles is gone, there's no one else on the crew who can match his might. Haaahaha!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Are you nuts?  
I'd rather die than ask Theseus for help.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
So, before it comes to that...I'm willing to lend a hand myself.  
  
   
**Jason:**   
You? For real?  
Are you sure you even know how to fight, grandma?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
You're the last person I want to hear that from!  
  
   
**Theseus:**   
I think it's wonderful that you'll be joining the fray.  
  
   
**Theseus:**   
I only hope that the ship doesn't get wrecked again now that it's almost repaired.  
  
   
**Theseus:**   
Also there're some ominous clouds making their way toward this island. If the seas start acting up, there's no telling what might happen to the ship.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
It's the curse pulling those storm clouds here. How is that a surprise? Of course the gods aren't gonna be thrilled about this, you jagoff.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Nonetheless...I swear to Hecate that your sails will be filled with wind again.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Now come on, Jason, grab your sword and help us!  
  
   
**Jason:**   
Grab my sword? I've got my hands full just keeping Medea's cabin safe!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Are you serious!? This is YOUR ship! You are sincerely dedicated to being a complete dick, aren't you?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
It is nothing new for him.  
If any monsters try to escape, I will take care of them.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Fujimaru, Mashaea, I would appreciate your help as well.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
R-right...!  
I'd be glad to!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't think I'll be any help whatsoever, but I'll do what I can.  
   
**Circe:**   
...Good to hear.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...I'm worried about Medea.  
   
**Circe:**   
...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Jason:**   
There, now that I've finished off this bottle of wine,  
let's get to the beach and do this thing!  
  
   
**Jason:**   
Okay Argonauts, go forth and get our home back!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Atalante:**   
Haaa!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
There, that takes care of all the monsters on the deck!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Now we just need to take care of the ones in the hold. What are your orders, Jason!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, uh, I'm afraid...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jason got hit by a barrel of apples and knocked out...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Jason died a hero's death in defense of his ship, I hear.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Atalante:**   
Again, hmm. Very well then,  
we will just have to finish this ourselves.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Circe...?  
...Ah...  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...So, you've finally shown yourself before me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? Medea's...commanding the curse monsters...?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
What... What is the meaning of this, Medea...!?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Hello, Circe, Atalante... Did you come here to laugh at me while I was bawling my eyes out?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Or perhaps to admonish me for my sins...?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...Medea...  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...No, nothing like that.  
I'm here to celebrate this new chapter in your life.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
New chapter...?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Just as I will never again be seen merely as a priestess...  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...Medea, you too have become a woman to be feared as a witch.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
So of course you're gonna mess other people's lives up something fierce. You can't help it! You're a witch!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Go ahead and seduce any man you want,  
then toss him aside when you're done!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
That's one of the best parts of being a witch, you know. You should be proud that you're worth that.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Although, I gotta say...you don't look all that happy about this to me.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
I can see you're smiling while we stand here, but I can also tell you're crying on the inside, and I have to say I don't like that.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
These curses come from me...  
They're my sins made manifest.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
So I'll take them with me when I go.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I cannot let you get away with that, Medea.  
Those curses will not stop until they sink this ship.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Medea...  
  
  
---  
   
**Circe:**   
(Sigh)... How many times did I tell you to learn the medicinal arts too, Medea?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Hecate's medicinal arts don't just heal the body.  
They have a powerful effect on the heart, too.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
But only if you spent time devoting yourself to the study of how the heart works while learning them.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
If you do that, it's a wonderful way to tame the monsters lurking in your heart.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
For a disciple of Hecate, I gotta say...I'm disappointed in myself for releasing such a half-assed witch into the world.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...This is exactly why I didn't want to take on an apprentice in the first place.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
But, now that we're here, I guess this scuffle's as good a time as any to teach you one last lesson!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
...(Gulp)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So...what happened to the Argo then?  
  
  
---  
   
**Circe:**   
Nothing, Piglet. There were no more mishaps, happenings, or even minor inconveniences worth mentioning after that.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
The Argonauts defeated every monster on board the ship and dispelled Medea's self-destructive curse.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
After that, I thanked them, threw them a big kykeon farewell party, and sent them on their merry way.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
And you already know the rest from the myth.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
All right, you have your own stuff to take care of, right, Master? Go on then, get out of here.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
That's it for today's kykeon party.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, Circe? I really do appreciate you telling us that story, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...you're sitting on Senpai's bed...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hey! Where do you think you're going with that pillow!? Put it back! Don't you click your tongue at me!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...(Sulk)  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I have rarely seen your lips so loose, falcon witch.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I never expected you to discuss your past in such detail.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...Well, so what? Felt like it, so I did.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
That's all water under the bridge for Medea and me anyway.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Hm...? What is it?  
Why're you looking at me like that?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Let us say...hypothetically...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...you encountered the hero of your dreams once more. What would you do?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Wh-what kind of stupid question is that?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...I am merely curious.  
I have no real experience in romance myself.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
And as such, I cannot imagine what it is to be driven mad by it, as Medea was.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Granted, the odds of that happening are vanishingly small, and so likely not worth considering...  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Hehe, oh, I wouldn't say that.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
I'm not the same old Circe I used to be. You don't really think I'd make the same mistake all over again, do you?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
In fact, you've got the whole thing back asswards. He's the one that would end up falling for me, the Queen Witch.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Who's falling for who now?  
  
  
---  
   
**Circe:**   
Bwaaa!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
P-Piglet! Where the hell'd you come from!?  
Don't scare me like that!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Huh? You're just going to the bathroom? You can't go in your own room 'cause you feel like someone's watching you?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
K-kind of an overshare, isn't it!?  
Go on, get out of here!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...Phew...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
So, you would make him fall in love with you...  
You are nothing if not confident, witch of Aeaea.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...Hell yeah I am!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Hehe. Still, that said...  
  
   
**Circe:**   
If I'd just stayed a hermit out on my island...I'd never have learned to be so recklessly confident.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
So I'm grateful to Pig&ndash;I mean, Master for that.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Hmm. That's nice. (Munch, munch)  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Wha...  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Hey, you're the one who started all this.  
Isn't it kinda rude for you to just shut down like that?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
I guess you didn't really care after all...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
...The Oak of Dodona once told me something while it let me listen to the ocean wind through its knothole.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
It said love would paddle in from far overseas and drop an anchor deep within your heart.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...Hmm...  
A divine prophecy, huh.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Whoever heard of a piece of wood being an oracle? Is it a dryad with a direct hotline to the gods or something?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Anyway, that said...I hope it's right! Wherever the tree gets its info from, I am definitely a fan of this prophecy.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
I know there's a much better guy for you out there.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Jason might have the makings of a hero,  
but he's got a long way to go before&ndash;  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Um, Auntie...?  
That prophecy? It was about you.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Bwa?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...H-hey, tree, who told you you could go making predictions about my future, huh!?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
The Oak also said...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
...that a hero you would never forget would come visit Aeaea Island one day.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
...Stop that. I'm the Queen Witch, remember?  
  
   
**Circe:**   
This isn't funny. I'm a disciple of Hecate herself.  
No way I'm letting Zeus pull that kind of stunt!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
...Of course.  
  
   
**Circe:**   
Hey, Medea, look!  
  
   
**Circe:**   
The sailors are praying to Zephyr as we speak.  
It won't be long before you set sail again.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
...I know.  
  
   
**E：Circe:**   
...Well, my defiant disciple, this is the last piece of advice I have for you.  
  
   
**E：Circe:**   
Stay on my island.  
  
   
**E：Circe:**   
The Argo's curse is gone.  
I've washed away its stain.  
  
   
**E：Circe:**   
The Argonauts can handle the rest of their journey without you.  
  
   
**E：Circe:**   
And nobody from Colchis would ever come looking for you here.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
I'm sorry, Auntie, but I can't do that.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
You saw what happened for yourself, right?  
Jason needs me.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Besides...  
  
   
**Medea:**   
...I don't want to be just a footnote in history like Ariadne.  
  
   
**E：Circe:**   
...I see. Well then, I guess there's nothing left to say but goodbye.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
I guess not.  
Take care of yourself, Auntie.  
  
   
**Medea:**   
Even though I'll be staying on, I pray you'll find the kind of love that would make me insanely jealous.  
  
   
**E：Circe:**   
...Hehe.  
  
   
**E：Circe:**   
You never change, do you!
