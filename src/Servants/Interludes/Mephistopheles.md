# Mephistopheles  
  
## Tick Tock, Bang!  
  
**Mephistopheles:**   
&ndash;Now then, now then.  
I have a hypothesis for you, my Master.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
I know this is sudden.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
But this world is ruled by an oppressor.  
Yes, a bad person. A very bad person!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
And so I've taken it upon myself to fix this.  
By blowing things up!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
And I want your help, you see.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Stalk the streets of London at night with me,  
and we'll set bombs!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Huge, amazing explosions! Dreadnought-class disaster!  
Come, let us travel to London!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Oh, Mash? Would you like to come with us?  
You're more than welcome.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
If you can? If you've nothing better to do?  
If you want to spoil the fun?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'll go with you no matter what, Master.  
Being alone with him seems like suicide.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Hehe, hehehehehe! Yes, of course!  
You must be ready for anything!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
And off we go, everyone!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...He dragged us off so quickly I didn't have time to object.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I guess we've got no choice. I can't contact the Doctor, so we'll just have to follow him.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!  
We start with golems, it seems!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
This must be a test of our abilities.  
Come, Master.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Let's tear them apart!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mephistopheles:**   
Heheh, too easy! Too easy!  
Weaker than the weakest of insects.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Golems... So our opponent is a mage, is that right, Mephistopheles?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
...Indeed!  
Well, basically.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Basically...?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Now, now, don't worry about it! Let's go!  
Let's fight!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Now we have to set up the bombs.  
Beep, beep, beep!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Begin&ndash;the countdown!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
And look, more enemies!  
Oh, how boring, just so boring.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Ye who possess no Command Spells, no arrogance, no pride, and no greed. My past Master!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
As your Servant, I shall finish you off without any hesitation!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mephistopheles:**   
And now, time for our next bomb.  
Let's go, Master.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, Master.  
Something...seems strange...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, sorry.  
Either way, it's clear that the enemy is trying to kill us.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
For now, let's cooperate with Mephistopheles.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Hehehehehe.  
The next bomb goes here.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
And look, the enemy arrives!  
Just what you'd expect, right?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Another homunculus?  
That Alchemist never changes, does he?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Master, let us kill them!  
For justice! Hyahahaha!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Alchemist?  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mephistopheles:**   
Two more bomb sites left to go. This right arm here is incredibly important to him, isn't it?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Now, then, shall I finish him off?  
Setting the bomb!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
And now here comes the enemy!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
...Whew!  
Mephistopheles, this is the last one, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...You can tell us now.  
The enemy was your former Master&ndash;  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Indeed! Indeed!  
Dr. Georg Faust!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
He forged me, he raised me, he feared me!  
And these bombs are a present for him.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
So he can live and die with a smile on his face.  
Now, time for the last battle!  
  
   
**???:**  
&ndash;So you're here, Mephistopheles.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Of course I am, Faust!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Oh, oh! What a pathetic joke you are!  
How comical and beautiful!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
You're so ugly now I can't bear it!  
  
   
**Faust:**   
Shut up, you failure of a project.  
It was foolish of me to grant you self-awareness.  
  
   
**Faust:**   
And now you've even betrayed your master&ndash;!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
How could I not, when you're so boring?  
  
   
**Faust:**   
You bastard...  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Yes, it's because you're boring!  
You were such an ordinary mage!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
You sacrificed others as if it was ordinary and yet reaped no results at all!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
You pretended to chase distant, unseen dreams and yet wasted your time on your ordinary life!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
How boring!  
What a boring mage you are!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
So why should I be blamed for taking a boring, average mage and making him famous throughout history?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Poor little Mephistopheles just doesn't understand.  
  
   
**Faust:**   
You... I'll kill you!  
I'll kill you, Mephistopheles!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Come on and try it.  
Now, my entertaining Master!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
This is the last battle!  
Shove that bomb up his butt!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Faust:**   
Gahh... Aggh!  
...You...traitor!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Oh no no. I granted your wish to never be forgotten, did I not?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Without me, would Goethe ever have written Faust?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
And without Faust, no one would have ever heard of you!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Hehehehehe! If you want someone to blame, blame Goethe! ..Bwah, ahahahahahaha!  
  
   
**Faust:**   
Damn you! Damn you! My curse upon you!  
My curse upon you, Mephistopheles!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
You're such a fool. A curse?  
Curses are like power-ups for me.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Now then. The bomb is set.  
And it's time to flip the switch.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
&ndash;My thanks for playing along with that entertainment.  
Master, as long as you entertain me&ndash;  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
I will never betray you.  
Probably... Ahahahaha!  
  
  
**--SECTION BREAK--:**  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning, Master. What's wrong?  
You're soaked with sweat.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Did you have a bad dream?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's nothing.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...?  
What do you think happened, Fou?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...?
