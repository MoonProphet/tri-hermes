# Osakabehime  
  
## Hikikomori Milky Way  
  
**Narration:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Dear Ma-chan.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I was officially summoned to Chaldea some time ago...or maybe a long time ago.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Now that I'm here, I want to live up to what's expected of a Servant.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But the thing is...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Ah, there truly is something to be said for keeping one's head cool and one's feet warm. I can't remember the last time my quill flowed so freely!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Somebody grab me one of those tangerines over there!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...  
...Oh, were you talking to me?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Here you go.  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Thanks, Purple Shikibu!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
(Gulp) Mmm, deelish! There's nothing better than tangerines. Fresh or frozen, they're always tasty.  
Talk about the fruit of the gods!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Oh, wait, I'm the god here, aren't I! Between the tangerines and the kotatsu, I thought I was turning Japanese! I really thought so!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Does Japan not have its own share of gods, Jaguar Warrior? Could you not be both a god and Japanese?  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Hm? (Casual whistling)  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Oh, never mind!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yo, let me get in on this!  
Turns out it's still kinda early for surfing!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Not that the seasons ever change 'round here!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I'm surrounded by so many strangers that I'm not quite sure what to do...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
(Well, I guess I've met Murasaki Shikibu before, but that writerly aura is still a lot for me to take.)  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Chotto a minute! Why are all you Servants hanging out in my room again!?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Where else're we s'posed to go?  
You've got the only kotatsu in Chaldea!  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Honestly though, I have to wonder if leaving it out all year is really the best course of action, meow.  
  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Then again, I guess I used to do the same thing. There's something to be said for leaving your kotatsu out even in the summer. Something dark, I mean.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was intruding...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Waaaaaah! How am I supposed to make any progress on my manuscript like this!?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Oh come now, I rather doubt you would have made any progress even in our absence.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Urk.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
It's okay, Lady Osakabehime.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Senpai...?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
If you just let your hair down and be yourself...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...your story will eventually take wing of its own accord...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
That only works if you're a genius!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Waaaaaah!  
Help me, Ma-chaaaaaan!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Okay, I'm in Batty's room now, but where's Batty?  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Ugh.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I've lost count of how many times she's gone into hiding at the first sign of trouble. It's a terrible habit of hers, isn't it, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Guess Batty isn't home...  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Batty? Not home? That is simply not possible.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
No, she's definitely in here somewhere.  
I'm sure of it.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Come on, let's search the room for her.  
Huh? How do I know she isn't actually out?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hehehe, oh Master.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You saw for yourself how eager Osakabehime was to use Musashi's absence as an excuse to shut herself in, right?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
There's no way!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
She would ever leave!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
We have been friends for a long time, so I know her well enough to say that with one-hundred-percent certainty♡  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Now come on, let's look for her.  
Baaatty! Where aaare yooou!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Come out now, while neither Master nor I is upseeet!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Olly olly oxen free!  
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh? Did you just hear something, Master?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hmm. Now where could that voice have come from...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Under the kotatsu, maybe?  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Under the kotatsu?  
...Ah, yes, I see.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Go away!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It came from over here...  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
So it did. Well done, Master♪  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Huh... It looks like this kotatsu is connected to an alternate dimension.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
What do we do now, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Simple. We dive in headfirst!  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Understood. Okay, Master, here I go!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We go get her!  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes, I'm sure Batty is waiting for us to retrieve her.  
All right then, let's go!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nooooooooo!!!  
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Master. Master! Please, get a hold of yourself!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Of all the places I thought the kotatsu could lead, Csejte Pyramid Himeji Castle was not one I even considered!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I've heard you go on about isekai before,  
Batty, but this is ridiculous!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Urushaddup! Just go away!  
I'm shutting myself in and working on my damn book!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Huh? That sounded like it came from...the castle keep?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
This is MY kotatsu now!  
Nobody gets in or out unless I seiso!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You said that as if you're just calling dibs, but I'm honestly impressed you made this place its own separate world. You're more skilled than I thought, Batty.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Right?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I've gotten a lot more used to fighting as a Servant than you'd think!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Heh heh heh, and on that note...byeanara,  
Ma-chan and Kiyo-yo!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're back again...  
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I guess Batty must have complete control over that Csejte Pyramid Himeji Castle.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I'm not sure what we can do if she can send us back here with just a flick of her finger...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Bye now! I'll come back once I'm done with my final draft!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...I don't know about this, Master.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Batty is lying. I don't think she really means to come back at all...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
No, that's not it. I think that SHE thinks she can't possibly come back.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hmm, now what are we going to do. I do feel bad that her kotatsu kept getting taken over...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...but that doesn't mean she can just run away from her responsibilities as a Servant.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
And I think Batty knows that better than anyone.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Which would mean her lie about coming back after finishing her final draft is actually...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Well, Master? What are you going to do?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What else?  
  
  
---  
   
**Narration:**   
...In short, I can live here in peace and tranquility.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Kotatsu, kotatsu, I'm so into you, kotatsuuu♪  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Don't come to get me, 'cause I don't wanna leeeave♪  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Besides, who'd even want to go out when it's raining? Everyone knows rainy days are the perfect excuse to stay in.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Exactly.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I'm not cut out to be a Servant.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...No, no. No, no, no.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Of course I know that's no excuse. I get it.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But just like a Berserker can't help but go berserk,  
I can't help the fact that I'm a shut-in at heart.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
So it shouldn't be a problem if I shut myself in for just a little bit now and then, right?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Let's see... I think I should be okay for twenty...thirty...fifty years or so?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I'll still be happy to serve Ma-chan even when [♂ he's /♀️ she's} an old [♂ man /♀️ lady}.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
That wouldn't bother me at all&ndash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It might not bother you, but it sure as hell would bother me!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't I get a say in this!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Huh?  
I... Wha...?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Gyaaaaaa!!!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Wh-wh-wh-what are you doing here again, Ma-chan!?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
What do you think, Bats-for-Brains?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Where do YOU of all people get off insulting my intelligence, Kiyo-yo!?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
What do you mean "of all people"? I'll have you know I could demonstrate my own intelligence in any number of ways.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...But that is not what is important right now.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I guess the fact that you'd casually consider shutting yourself in for fifty years just goes to show how ridiculous your innately inhuman sense of time is.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I, on the other hand, acquired my inhumanity later on, so my sense of time is so finely attuned I was able to match my breathing to Master's down to the second. I'm keeping count, so there's no mistake!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...(World's longest awkward pause) Right!  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hmm. I'll have to get to the bottom of what that long silence meant later.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you now. Gee, what a coincidence.  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
(Sniff) You can be so cold sometimes, Master...  
But I won't let that bring me down!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Hey! What do you think you're doing!?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
That's just what we came here to ask.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
As if turning your room into a separate world wasn't bad enough, now you want to shut yourself in it for fifty years!?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
From one hime to another, I refuse to let you get away with this!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Nooo! I don't wanna! I'm too scaaared!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Forget it! If you think you can drag me out of here, go ahead and do your worst!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Ugh. I'm sorry you had to see my friend behave so disgracefully, Master...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Still, she was at least being truthful in what she said.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
She truly is frightened, and does really want to shut herself away.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
But she's also determined to put up a fight to make that happen now. She never had that kind of confidence before.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
To put it simply, Master...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...she's just as proud to be your Servant as any of us.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes, that pride may have led her to be weirdly confident about all the wrong things, but that's just Batty for you.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
All right, Master, let's make our way straight to the castle keep, shall we?  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are those the monkeys we saw on the mountain?  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
They must have taken a liking to this place.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
But I'm afraid they'll just have to move to the Enma-tei, whether they like it or not.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This place reminds me of Mecha Eli-chan...  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my! Talking about another woman when you're here with me!?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Well I never!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
At any rate, my nose is telling me we should keep heading up.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Unfortunately, there's a limit to what my Stalking Skill can track when I'm not using them on you...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
But, hehehe, the good news is, I don't need them to know where she's hiding.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she's in her room again...  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Agreed. Now come on, let's head straight up to the top of this castle.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Haha, maybe the kotatsu in her room here leads to yet another alternate world.  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
So a world inside a world, like a set of Matryoshka dolls? That does sound like an interesting idea.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hehehe. All that aside, we haven't had many chances to be alone lately, Master.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
We can't let this one go to waste!  
Now come on, let's take it niiice and slow.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Like, three steps forward, three steps back slow♡  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's not slow, that's literally going nowhere!  
  
  
---  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Chotto a minute! Are you just using me as an excuse to get your own fun in, Kiyo-yo!?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I sure am♪  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Waaahhh! I thought we were besties!  
Have you no kokoro!?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Me? Heartless? How rude.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I'll have you know there is no Servant in this entire world whose heart burns hotter than mine.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Right, Master?  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Narration:**   
...All sorts of Servants have started visiting my room.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I know it's probably a good thing.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I used to be sad and mopey all the time.  
Now I think I'm leading a fuller life.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Every day here is great. The work, the training, the small talk... It's all so refreshingly straightforward.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I have old friends here I can be myself around, and I've made new ones, too.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
If someone asked whether or not I liked this,  
my honest answer would be that I do.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But every time I come to that conclusion, I can feel the gears in my heart creaking against the strain.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
No, no, no.  
This isn't who you are.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
That's when I start to feel bad again. Not at how wrongly I'm behaving, but at how right.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...I want to be left alone.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It's just as hard now as it was before. Being around people is tiring, all the smiling gives me a cramp, I can't get any work done on my book...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But at the same time, I can't pretend to be a proud lone wolf. I still get lonely.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Unlike a certain king I could name, I can't really say I'm okay just being all by myself.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It sucks. My feelings are all over the place, and I can't put them into words in any kind of way that makes sense.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I half-ass everything... I can never choose a side...  
I'm a bat, a snake, a castle monster...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...I don't know WHAT I am.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Is something wrong, Master?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You looked as though you were dreaming even while you were walking.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry, I guess I spaced out.  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hmph. I can't believe you'd space out when you're here with me!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think...I just saw one of Osakabehime's dreams...  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Well, this is Batty&ndash;Osakabehime's domain. It's no surprise something like that could happen here.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
It's nothing as strong as a Reality Marble, of course. It's just a big papier-mâché delusion stretched as far as it'll go.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I could burn it all now and this would be over in an instant, but Batty really would shut herself away if I did that.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
So I'm afraid I'll need you to join me for at least a little while longer, Master.  
  
   
  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
What is this writing?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Ah! That's my&ndash;!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is something wrong?  
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...No, everything's fine. Now that its magical energy is gone, it's just a plain old bit of text.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I'll just put it in this box over here and leave it by the wall.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Phew.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You owe me one, Batty.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...I'll do my best to make it up to you.  
  
  
**--ARROW--:**  
  
**Kiyohime:**   
This hall is very long...but my Stalking Skill is never wrong.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
And right now, it's telling me it won't be long until we see Batty in person.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Grr. So you finally made it, Kiyo-yo and Ma-chan...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
But I'm daijo... I'm okay. You can leave now. I'm essentially just hiding out in my kotatsu, anyway.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You need to go outside sometimes, Batty.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
No I don't. What's wrong with staying in?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You're only being halfway honest about this. You want to go out, but you also don't want to go out.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...It doesn't make any sense, does it?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I have been enjoying myself here,  
thanks to Ma-chan giving me the push I needed.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
But...it's also so exhausting!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I understand. Okay then, let's fight it out.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...Uh, why?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Master wants to help you,  
and you want to turn [♂ him /♀️ her} away.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
We could talk it out for days and never get anywhere. Violence, on the other hand, is a much faster solution.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I think you might be spending too much time with Tomoe these days, Kiyo-yo! You're starting to sound just like her!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can we at least try talking this out first?  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
N-no! There's nothing I want to talk about!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Are you hiding something, Hime?  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
N-no! Not a damn thing!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Now that was just an outright lie.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You have something you want to talk about,  
and there's something you're hiding.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
But you're too embarrassed to share.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Gnnnh...! You big baka lie detector!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Fine then! If that's how you want to play this, then kakatte come on!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
If that's what I gotta do to maintain my hiko lifestyle for a while, I'll meet violence with violence!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Osakabehime:**   
Yeooowch! Hot, hot, hot!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Mmm, roast bat♪  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I knew you were a dragon,  
but I didn't think you were a demon too!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Ugh, fine! You win! I give up!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Good. All right, Batty, tell us what's really going on.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Gnnn...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...(Sigh)  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Here, Master, I'll give you two some space.  
That's two you owe me now, Batty.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I know, I know.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...I felt us syncing up earlier.  
You saw something, didn't you?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I saw what life in Chaldea has been like for you.  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Then I shouldn't really need to say anything.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I saw the same you I always do.  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...That isn't who I always am.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I could never live with myself if it was.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Basically, I guess...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I've been having a constant stream of visitors in my room lately.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
They're loud, and annoying, and exasperating...but I don't have the guts to tell them to leave.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
And even if I hole up on my own like this...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...it just doesn't feel like the amazing paradise it used to...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I can't make up my mind how I feel.  
I don't make any sense.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
When I'm alone, I want company.  
When I have company, I want to be alone.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Pretty selfish of me, huh.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is it...?  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Yes! It is!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I wouldn't really call that selfish.  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Well it is!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...That said, this really isn't that big of a deal. Honestly.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I just need to try a little harder.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
If I'm alone, I can just go hang out with someone.  
And if I'm with someone, I can just go be by myself.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
The only problem is, I can't find the courage to do that. I mean, how could I?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
The only one who inspires me to be brave like that is...well...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who?  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
How can you be such a baka!?  
I'm talking about you, of course!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wait. You don't mean me, do you?  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
You're really just starting to wakarunderstand!?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Between last winter and this spring the frequency of you visiting me considerably dropped!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
This is a huge problem, Ma-chan!  
Now look me in the eyes and tell me the truth!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Did you stop visiting because my kotatsu is too hot?  
Have I been getting in your way somehow?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
(Gyaaaaaah! What am I even saying!?)  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
(Yabe! I can barely believe what I'm saying,  
and I'm the one saying it!)  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
(Still, there is no arguing [♂ he /♀️ she} hasn't been coming to my room lately!)  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
(Whatever [♂ he /♀️ she} tells me,  
I have to be ready to handle it!)  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
(At least this isn't a normal Holy Grail War,  
so I shouldn't have to worry about getting fired!)  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
(Although, I guess [♂ he /♀️ she} could force me to go into my spirit form... Iyaaaaa!)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I didn't want to get in the way of your writing...  
  
  
---  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...Huh? What're you talking about?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...  
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is everything okay?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe you should take a little break...  
  
  
---  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Sorry Ma-chan, but would you mind being shizuquiet for a bit!?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Rrgh, none of this is working!  
I can't seem to get my thoughts in order!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I, uh, I see.  
  
  
---  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Done! It's all done!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Congratulations!  
  
  
---  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Now to ride this high and get started on my next book!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm just gonna get going, okay?  
  
  
---  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
(Humming happily)  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I... I... I...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I was so focused on my books that I didn't even realize how much of a jerk I was being! I'm so soooooorry!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Well? Is everything better now?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
If by “better” you mean “deeply hazukashii at how badly I treated Master and my completely dumb misreading of the situation”...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...then yes, I guess you could say things are better now.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's okay. I should have said something sooner.  
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Ugh. You really need to stop coddling your Servants so much, Master.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Still, it's obvious that you didn't do this out of malice, Batty.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
So if Master is willing to forgive you,  
I'll at least hold off on calling in Musashi.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Okay, would you mind not just going from zero to nightmare scenario like it's no big deal!?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Whenever Musashi shows up, she's always smiles and positive energy, and she absolutely destroys my entire gloomy shtick!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
But anyway...I'll go back now.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
As long as you're with me, Ma-chan,  
I can deal with just about anything.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
So, um...do you think you might be willing to come visit me again?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course!  
  
  
---  
   
**Narration:**   
...And so, my selfish attempt at running away&ndash;or running and hiding, in this case&ndash;ended just like that.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Once again, my room became a popular hangout spot...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...but thanks to the little pipsque&ndash;Ms. Beni-Enma's advice, I decided to make a “Do Not Disturb” sign.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It turns out people here can be surprisingly respectful of each other's privacy.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Now, when I need to focus on my books without interruption or intrusion, I just put up the sign.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
And if I feel like having company again, I just take it down and the place becomes lively in no time.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Of course, I told Ma-chan [♂ he /♀️ she} can ignore that sign and come in whenever [♂ he /♀️ she} likes.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I don't usually notice [♂ him /♀️ her} coming in when I'm focused on my book...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...but whenever I turn around and notice [♂ him /♀️ her} sitting nearby, just cheerfully reading manga...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...it makes me feel both incredibly happy and incredibly apologetic all at once.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I'll probably need to come up with a name for this feeling someday...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...but for now, I'm content keeping it tucked away inside my kokoro...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
All right, time to put up the “Do Not Disturb”  
sign and get to work on my&ndash;  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Gyaaaaaah!  
Did I just kick something soft!?  
  
   
**Low Blood Pressure Kunoichi:**   
Zee zee zee... Zee zee zee...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Are you really asleep? 'Cause you're just saying the letters in “zzz” instead of actually snoring!  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Oh well. This sort of thing just comes with the territory now. And for the most part...I'm really enjoying my life here at Chaldea.
