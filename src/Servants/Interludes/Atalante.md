# Atalante  
  
## Smile of the Goddess  
  
**Atalante:**   
Master, I need to talk to you.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
You see, I want to go out to sea.  
There's something that I left on that Island.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
If it's no problem, I'd like to leave now&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We're lucky we have a ship, but what did you leave behind?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Oh, a statue of Artemis&ndash;the Lunar goddess.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I made it by hand, but I couldn't take it with me during the battle.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
We were born from the gods, and they give us power.  
We must never fail to be grateful.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Well, despite their great power, some of them can be a little strange.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
It's their charm point, and their weakness.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, you've had a rough time because of it&ndash;  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
There should be a cave on the other side of this forest.  
Let's go.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...The stench of animals. Mash, ready your weapon&ndash;  
and prepare for combat.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is&ndash;a chimera!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
A demonic beast left behind in this world...  
Its luck ran out when it met a hunter, though.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I will make good use of its meat and pelt.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Atalante:**   
What a headache...  
Let's keep going.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Are we almost at the cave?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Yeah...Okay, this is the entrance.  
Let's go.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Hey, Master, do you have any wishes for the Grail?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not really.  
   
**Atalante:**   
Hmm.  
I see...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Well, given the state of the world that makes sense, I guess.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
But the Grail's power is omnipotent.  
Perhaps you should come up with a wish.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
To restore the world.  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Hmph. That's exactly the right wish.  
But it's also the wrong answer.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
When you get the Grail, that wish should come true on its own.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
A greedy answer isn't necessarily the wrong one.  
Keep that in mind.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Atalante:**   
...To tell the truth, I have a wish of my own.  
It's a simple wish, and I know it will never come true&ndash;  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
But I still can't give up on it.  
That's why I pray to the gods.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I protect my vows to the gods.  
...Or so I thought...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Atalante is looking off into the distance...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, that goddess was pretty...  
impactful.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Enough talking, I suppose.  
It's time for combat.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Master, stay back.  
...Let's go!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Atalante:**   
We should be almost there...  
Oh, good. This is it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's the statue of the goddess?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Yes, it's handmade.  
Impressive, right?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
If you just add Orion there.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Needs more Orion.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Atalante:**   
Y-You want me to make one of him? Hmm...  
He's the type of person I hate most.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
He's lazy, lustful, and never learns. He's only interested in having fun, and doesn't care for others.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...He did look like he was having fun, but that fun is far too different for my tastes.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Not my type of man at all. If I had to pick between him and Jason, I don't know what I'd do.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-It's that bad?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Let me ask you, Mash. If Jason and Orion were the last two men in the world, who would you marry?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? I'd um...  
Well...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
See what I mean...huh?  
  
   
**???:**  
Hehehe, that's not a nice way to talk about someone's boyfriend, is it...Atalante?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Hyah!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
T-That voice!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Hey guys!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Hello, I know this is a surprise but I am back...  
Speaking of which, Mash are you busy later?  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Hehehehe. Even if it's the truth,  
denying it is proof of my love!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
So let's do this!  
If I win you'll never get my blessing again.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
I don't know about my Brother, though!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
That's crazy!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Artemis:**   
Ugh, I lost.  
I guess my love still isn't strong enough!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Huh? You've got more love? Seriously?  
What you've got is already crushing me...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Well, if I lost, I lost.  
You may retain my blessing!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Thank you Goddess, I will continue to treasure this statue.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Okay Orion, let's go back!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Mash, at least hold me tight against your chest...  
BRWRAH!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Well. That was an unexpected interruption,  
but we made it through...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Thank you, Master.  
I owe you.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Now let us return.  
Want to take that chimera meat with us?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
You must be sick of rations.  
No? I see...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Then this boar pelt... No, huh?  
Hmph. This is difficult.  
  
  
## London Child  
  
**Atalante:**   
I'm sorry, Master.  
May I have a word?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...  
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is it?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You look depressed.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Atalante:**   
...I want to go to this London place you visited. Will you help?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;We're here, but why are we here?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I heard there was a child Servant.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Jack the Ripper.  
Yes, she WAS a child... I think.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
To think that's who she really was... What a shock.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
That's not exactly right. She's simply one aspect of Jack the Ripper.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Jack the Ripper is a black box, filled with the beliefs, hypotheses, and ideas of people everywhere.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Even without knowing the real killer, as long as you know the name you can summon the appropriate Servant.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...In that sense, she's similar to Hassan-i Sabbah.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
In a normal Holy Grail War, one of almost 20 of them can be summoned via the concept of “Assassin”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You sure know a lot.  
I am surprised.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I've crossed paths with them.  
I hope that child disappears completely...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? She should've disappeared already&ndash;  
  
   
**???:**  
&ndash;Hehehehe.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!?!?!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's weak, but I'm picking up a reading around you! Be careful!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
What...was that?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Remnants of a Servant.  
Best to destroy them.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Hehe, hehehe, heheheheh.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
There's more!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This feeling... It's her!  
Fall back, Master!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
&ndash;Rest in peace, Jack!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
...The reading in this area is gone. Doctor, are you picking up more?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hold on, I'm expanding the search radius.  
...Ah! Yes, I've found something similar...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Let's head there, then.  
Master, Mash, follow me!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
For a Servant, past Holy Grail Wars are more like hazy dreams than distant memories.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
No matter how strong a past bond might be, it will inevitably fade.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Of course it will. Fighting a hundred Holy Grail Wars is like leading a hundred lives.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
More than anything, it ceases to feel real.  
You stop being able to cling to just one life.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
It doesn't mean we're choosing a noble death.  
We're simply abandoning a pallid life.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
So we forget them&ndash;like they were the dreams we once had. But some things cannot be forgotten.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
That battle, to me, was one of them.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Hehehe! Hehehe!  
Mommy! Mommy!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
&ndash;Mommy!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This voice!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I thought you might not have completely disappeared... Jack the Ripper.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Yup. I mean, this world is wavering.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
So even we, who should no longer be here, can look for her once more.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Stop it, Jack.  
You won't find your mother in this world.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Even if she did exist, she wouldn't accept you as her daughter.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Shut up!  
You don't know anything about us!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
You're wrong. I do know you... However...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I don't understand you. I can't understand you. You don't want to be understood.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
You will try to fulfill your wish.  
I will stop you. That is all.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Okay, got it. Then&ndash;  
it's time to die!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Here it comes!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Sorry, but I must finish you off.  
I truly am sorry.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Jack:**   
Wah...wah...  
That's so mean...so mean...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
&ndash;You're right. I'm mean.  
Still, I wanted to save you.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I really, really wanted to save you.  
No matter how broken you were.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
...I see.  
Hehe, you're weird, Mommy.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We were...saved...already&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Whew... We beat her.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...No, we didn't.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
As long as London exists, she'll keep coming back.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Until we restore history to its proper form.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?  
But she&ndash;  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Jack is special. When history is restored, she'll pass on as she should.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...That's what I want to believe.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Master, my wish is to save all the abused, unhappy children in this world.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
What do you think?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's a good wish.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's a hard wish.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Atalante:**   
Thank you for not laughing.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
It may be hard.  
No, it may be close to impossible.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
But still...  
I can't give up on my wish.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Even if it becomes an eternal chain which binds me forever&ndash;  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I will keep fighting.  
Let's go, Master.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
First, we have to save the world so that the children can live.
