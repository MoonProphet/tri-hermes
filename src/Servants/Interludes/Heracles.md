# Heracles  
  
## Oath of Hercules  
  
**Mash:**   
Master! This is bad!  
The nearby village is being attacked by wild beasts!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And it happened quite suddenly, it seems.  
Are you awake, Fujimaru?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We must hurry to that village!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go, Berserker!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Heracles:**   
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&mdash;!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm not sure that Berserker is well suited for rescue efforts. I hope it will be all right...the village, I mean...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Not just the fields are being destroyed, the buildings are as well... Doctor! Get us details on the enemy!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I am, already! What? Whoa! Their numbers are incredible! It's completely surrounded!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, we'll just have to take them out as we see them!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You got it! Let's do this!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm counting on you, Berserker!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Heracles:**   
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Nice work! We're done on this side.  
Oh, no! That girl!  
  
   
**Girl:**   
Waaaah! ...Mommyyyyy!  
  
   
**Heracles:**   
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is going to be bad! Berserker doesn't see the child! You've got to stop him somehow!  
  
   
**Heracles:**   
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!  
  
   
**Girl:**   
Waaaah!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Halt, Heracles!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Stop right there!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Heracles:**   
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I-I'm so scared, I can't look directly into the monitor...  
Fujimaru, was the girl...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, Doctor. She's all right.  
He's going after what's behind her!  
  
   
**Werebeast:**   
Gyarrrh!  
  
   
**Girl:**   
Waaaah!  
That scared meeee...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Now, now. It's all right.  
Run off somewhere safe, all right?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Whew!  
Thank goodness the girl is fine.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, that's right! Berserker must be directing his hostility toward large foes first. That's why he&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, how many survivors are left?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, man! We're surrounded by enemies!  
You're in an even worse situation than before!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then let's go nuts!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Crush them, Berserker!  
   
  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Heracles:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, Fujimaru, I figured out why Berserker did what he did earlier.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Earlier?  
Oh, you mean when that girl was spared by Heracles.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, that. I thought there was something odd about it, so I did some digging and found out the Madness Enhancement on Heracles,  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
is actually rather weak.  
It leaves a tiny bit of his reasoning intact.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So, earlier, thanks to that bit of reasoning, he didn't attack the girl.  
  
   
**Heracles:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, I see. But why is Heracles's Madness Enhancement so weak?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, that's because Madness Enhancement was originally a skill meant to forcefully strengthen weak Servants.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But when it comes to a Servant like Heracles, driving him mad consumes massive amounts of magical energy.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In other words, the Madness Enhancement level is reduced, enabling him to manifest by using less energy.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyway, the fact that you don't have that much magical energy, Fujimaru, also plays a role in that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You mean to say, Heracles's current status is much weaker than what he could've been?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But even at that, it's far stronger than most Heroic Spirits.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Rather, I am kind of scared to find out what he could've been.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, I see...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So, he'd be even stronger than now.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Heracles:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...But I'm sure that even at Heracles's original state of madness, that girl still would have been safe.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, no. I really doubt that.  
He's a Berserker, you know. A Berserker!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're right. I'm sure of it too.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Heracles wouldn't do that.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm not so sure about that...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, for sure...!  
  
   
**Heracles:**   
...  
  
  
## The 13th Labor  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry, Master.  
Look what's happened...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's not your fault, Mash.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Now is when things get good!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You only meant to exterminate the beasts. Who knew that it would become a fight for survival...  
  
   
**Heracles:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even Heracles is wiped out, thanks to him going rampage for three days and nights...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is this...a labyrinth?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yep, Fuyuki's underground labyrinth... Where the Massive Cavern located. I'm picking up an odd response at the far end of the labyrinth.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's either remnants of the Singularity, or a dimensional disturbance. Either way, we can't just ignore it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We have to eradicate it while its roots are still small.  
Let's get going right away, Senpai.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And, we fell right into a trap...  
It's a parting present from Professor Lev, dammit!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Not only there's no singularity here, there's nothing here period. And the way to the exit is packed with enemies.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And it looks like you're being trapped inside a magical dimension, keeping the communication up is the best I can do, let along interfering.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
Here they come again! Let's do this, Heracles!  
  
   
**Heracles:**   
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)&ndash;!!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Haa...haa...  
  
   
**Heracles:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A-Are you all right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, we got through it somehow...  
But at this rate, we'll eventually be wiped out...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm not sure I want to say this, but...  
we aren't completely out of options.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is it?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Tell us.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You know Berserker... I told you about it before, right? Heracles's madness is...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's not a true "Madness Enhancement."  
He can be even more powerful...  
  
   
**Heracles:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You mean, his original "Madness Enhancement"...?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes...If we can restore his "Madness Enhancement,"  
there might be...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
a way out of this predicament...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All right! Let's do it!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But it seems like there's some problem with it, right?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Like I told you before, in order to power up a Heroic Spirit like Heracles using Madness Enhancement,  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
we need an incredible amount of magical energy...  
So much is needed, that it would kill an ordinary mage.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Besides, there're many tales of Heracles in his madness. What's more, every time he's enraged, some tragedy occurs as well.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm against doing it.  
I can't allow you to expose Senpai to such a danger.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But, you've reached your limit, right, Mash...?  
There's no other way...  
  
   
**Heracles:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All right! Let's do it!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're never making it out anyway!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So, how do I do this?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Tell me how to do it.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's easy to accomplish. You simply need to pray for it. You just need to change the original summon chant a little.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&ndash;Thy body shall be consumed with madness...  
or something like that.  
  
   
**Heracles:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is bad. The enemy's about to unleash their strongest yet. A phantasmal, worse yet, a dragon.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm not going to force you to do it.  
Fujimaru, you have to decide.  
  
   
**Heracles:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Thy body shall be consumed with madness!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai!!!  
  
   
**Heracles:**   
...!!  
  
   
**Dragon:**   
Gaaaaaarrrrrr!  
  
   
**Heracles:**   
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!!!!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
Incredible...So this is Heracles's true power...  
  
   
**Heracles:**   
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We're in trouble! Just as I thought! It's impossible to control him! At this rate, Fujimaru, you'll...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai!!!  
  
   
**Heracles:**

**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, at least you were able to overcome that predicament, and somehow escaped.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, you do have a look that says "everything's peachy," but they almost died, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At any rate...I'm exhausted...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's pretty amazing that you were able to control Berserker under those circumstances. You're really quite something.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, hardly...I mean, later I...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
To be honest, I fainted.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So, when you activated the Madness Enhancement,  
Fujimaru, your energy supply ran out.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Then Berserker also ran out of fuel and stopped moving...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No. Actually, after that, Heracles alone wiped out all the monsters in that area.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I know it's hard to believe, but...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm, so it's possible we still didn't fully activate his "Madness Enhancement?"  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, way! That's crazy... Even a great Heroic Spirit of Olympus couldn't be that incredible, right?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who's to say?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
At any rate, it was a big help.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Heracles:**   
...(grin)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What?  
Did Heracles just...?  
  
   
**Heracles:**   
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&ndash;!!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Gah!!  
That scared the heck outta me!
