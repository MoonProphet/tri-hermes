# Alexander   
  
## The Beginning of a Trampling Conquest  
  
**Mash:**   
...You want to meet the hero of the Iliad?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Yes, that's right.  
Can you help me out?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
With your summoning system, I should be able to meet that great hero, right?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
The great Greek hero from the greatest of epics! His spear, his chariot, his body...the strongest is the only word to describe them!  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
I love it all. My tutor, Aristotle, gave me a copy of the Iliad a while ago&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(A while ago?)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foufou.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Oh, no, no. In life, I mean.  
In this form, I sometimes get it wrong.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
I'm sure you know this, but I love the Iliad and its heroes.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
You want to read it, Master? It's great! It's like an exquisite fruit, you never get tired of it.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Someday when I go to battle,  
I want to keep it with me at all times.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Someday?)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foufou?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Oh, oops. I got it wrong again.  
Haha, sorry. It just all seems so strange.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
My personality and emotions from when I was young are very strong in this form. Somehow, my memories are being influenced as well.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
I need to watch out for that, huh?  
So, how about it&mdash;Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The hero of the Iliad, huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Achilles, huh?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai. The hero Achilles, the protagonist of the Iliad.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
One of Ancient Greece's greatest heroes.  
But now&ndash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I heard what you were saying, and unfortunately...  
We haven't been able to summon him.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
You haven't, huh?  
Well, that's even better!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? How is it even better?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Oh, I see. Even as his younger self, he still has a heart for adventure? I've got a bad feeling about this.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
That's right, Doctor!  
Now we get to go look for him!  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Let's go in search of the great hero!  
There was an era where you saw the Argo, right?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
If we go there, we might be able to find him.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Do you remember?  
When I met you in ancient Rome&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...You're right. Your presence there seemed to guide other Heroic Spirits too.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I couldn't analyze the data in real time then, but you're right. That big Berserker is your...  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
My rival...or someone destined to be.  
That's what I think now.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Yes, Darius III.  
He was brought there by a “chained summoning.”  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm, it makes sense.  
Even with the Singularity repaired&ndash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It might still be possible to chain summon in the Age of Exploration!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then it's settled!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master.  
But the Third Singularity is&ndash;  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Okay Doctor, get ready!  
We're off in search of the hero of the Iliad!  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
???  
Hmm?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
What? What is...this? This thing in front of me?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(I thought so...)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
What is this?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's gotten into him?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's looking in shock at the sea.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right&ndash; The sea has a special meaning to him.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Okeanos, the end of the world. What he would eventually seek later in life. The limits of his territory.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's said that all his conquests in his later years were to bring him to Okeanos&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Seeing the ocean should be a special thing for him...  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
...It's like there's a haze over it.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
I can't see it, or hear it.  
Hey, what's that's over there?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
What can you hear?  
I can't really hear anything.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
I can see the land, and I can hear your voices, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Maybe young Alexander is unconsciously choosing not to see it.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He can't see or hear it, huh? Maybe Iskandar the conqueror would have wanted to&ndash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But this young Alexander might not want to see it yet.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
&ndash;How romantic.  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, you're right.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's kind of sad.  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. And very like him at the same time.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Alexander:**   
Hmm, I don't know.  
Maybe I should head over there with Bucephalus?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foufou!  
...Kyuu?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
N-No, that's&ndash;  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
I'm fine. Sorry. It was a joke.  
Anyway, guys, looks like we have company.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, you're right... A group of humans is approaching.  
I'm not detecting any trace of magical energy from them.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
They're... You know... Burglars or bandits...?  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
Who are ye callin' bandits?  
We're pirates! Real live pirates!  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
We just stopped here to resupply, and it's our lucky day! A pretty lady and a rich little brat!  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
Ransom 'em for all they're worth!  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
Let's go, men! With our skill and pride&mdash;  
It's super-plunderin' time!  
  
   
**Pirates:**   
Aye aye! Let's finish this quick so we don't have to work overtime&ndash;!  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Hahaha, you guys are hard workers, huh?  
But you shouldn't mix up work and hobbies.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, just think of them as a type of bandit!  
Senpai, enemy group approaching!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Prepare for combat!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They're human, so don't kill them!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Master!  
&ndash;Commencing combat!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Pirate:**   
No way&mdash;!? He's seriously ripped for being a brat!  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
H-he's like a bodybuilder... We are no match for him! Run... Run away!  
  
   
**Pirates:**   
Uwah&ndash;!  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Not a scrap of talent among you. Alright, run.  
I won't kill you!  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
If you run, it's because you're weak!  
A true plunderer leaves with a victory song!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's the future King of Conquerors for you.  
He's very wild.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yup, very wild.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not many boys could say that.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's wild.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**???:**  
Yup, I think so too. I see, the future King of Conquerors, huh&ndash;  
  
   
**???:**  
I heard a kid just beat up some veteran pirates, and since I was sponging off of them I came to check it out.  
  
   
**???:**  
But it looks like you're not an ordinary kid.  
Interesting. And that book you've got&ndash;  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
What about the Iliad?  
It's my favorite book.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
And who are you? You look “stronger” than the others.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
...May I have your name?  
  
   
**???:**  
Wait, you don't know who I am?  
I guess that'd be hard without my Noble Phantasm.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou! Fou??  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Alexander, he is&mdash;  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
I know. He's a Servant.  
So what's your name?  
  
   
**???:**  
So, you're not gonna introduce yourself? You ask my name and you won't even give me yours? That's rather rude.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
That's right. I apologize.  
My name is Alexander.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
I'm the future King of Conquerors. Not that it seems real to me. This form is from before that.  
  
   
**???:**  
Alexander, huh?  
  
   
**???:**  
Man, I bet that lightning geezer would like that name.  
It's a pain, but I'll remember it anyway.  
  
   
**???:**  
My name's “Achilles.” The Greek warrior written of in that book. You know that name, right?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
!!! It's you! You're Achilles!  
Oh, I can't believe this. I&ndash;  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
I found you so quickly! Mash, Fujimaru!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
W-What?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is he getting excited?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Alexander:**   
I can't hold back my excitement!  
Haha, I'm sorry, but this is so wonderful!  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Even now, I feel an overwhelming desire to&ndash;  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Fight him!  
It's okay, right, Master?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
I thought you'd say that.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
I know a fighter by their smell.  
Both you and I are the same type of punk.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
But&mdash;Nah, I'm really sorry.  
I'm just a freeloader, I mean, mentor now.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
I wanted to try copying Chiron for once...  
And so I've been looking after them.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
So I won't fight you.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
My job isn't to defeat you, it's to let these guys beat you.  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
Sir! Sir Spikey!  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
You'd really do that? For a bunch of no-name losers like us with zero attention span!?  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
Did you hear that, men! No running! Gather up, Gather up! Let's show our teacher what we can do!  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
Let's use the Achilles-style technique,  
“Gang up on a lone guy and beat him up.”  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
AKA, “What to do if you see a Lancer with an unkempt beard!” Now is the time!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I think we just heard a name for a tactic that we can never let Hektor hear, Senpai!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Feeling better, you losers?  
Okay, now go get your butts kicked!  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
Aye aye, sir! Let's do this!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, there's no stopping them!  
Resuming battle!!  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
That's fine. If a leader makes them stronger, that makes me happy.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
I just have to defeat them all, right? Once the students are gone, the teacher will be out of work.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
And after that&mdash;  
We can fight, Achilles!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
So you don't even think the pirates have a chance, huh? You're pretty cruel, kid! Wahahaha!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Achilles:**   
Impressive. I'm not a big fan of kings,  
but you, I think I like.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
And that horse, too&mdash;  
It's splendid. Truly excellent.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Actually, I think there are no bad Riders.  
That's my theory, anyway.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Hah, hah... I agree, but I didn't think...  
You'd have this much talent as a general!  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
The pirates' tactics were as messed up as Elisabeth's singing, and you brought them together...  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Fighting with soldiers, not just one on one...is so much fun!  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Someday I'll learn this feeling for myself, although really I should already know it. But I think...  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
I want to... I want to fight you more. I want to share this excitement, and the honor of the battlefield...  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
With more...people...someday...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-Alexander&ndash;?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
...Zzzz.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He has the magical energy to keep going, but I guess he's just exhausted. He fell asleep.  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
...Wow, we just saw something amazing...  
I can't believe we're still alive...  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
The world's big... It's too big...  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
There's flying horses that summon lightning and stuff...  
I think I'm reevaluating my life!  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
Yup, I can't do this!  
Being a pirate on seas like this is suicide!  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
We're better off landlocked!  
Teacher, we're getting out of the pirate business!  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
We'll pay the lesson fees later! Bye!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
H-Huh? Later? If you guys go on land you'll be arrested and thrown in prison...  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Well, whatever. Take care, idiots!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Combat has concluded. No wounded on our side, and no casualties among theirs.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That was a fun fight, huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This is a different kind of fight altogether.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Alexander's charge on horseback and the way Achilles rallied the pirates were both amazing.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The pirates that seemed so dangerous at first...  
They were completely taken aback by it.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
&ndash;Now then.  
You guys fought hard too.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Good work. You're that kid's guardian, right?  
I bet he gets you in all kinds of trouble.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
One day, I'm sure he'll be a great king somewhere.  
Until then, just keep an eye on him.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Right now he's just a little brat.  
Man, look at his sleeping face.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
...Zzzz.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yeah. He looks really happy, doesn't he Senpai?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No matter how cheerful he may seem, his actions and beliefs are filled with power. I can feel it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Even if that path is filled with turmoil and chaos.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The men he commands will probably lead happy lives.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Their lives will be busy.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It'll be hard for those around him.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou.
