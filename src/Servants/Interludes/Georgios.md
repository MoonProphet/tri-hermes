**Mash:**   
Teacher, I have a question.  
What's the difference between a lizard and a dragon?  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Good question. To answer, first we'll have to talk about the phantasmal species&ndash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So, um, what's going on here?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Teacher?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm not sure...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Georgios:**   
You there! No whispering in class!  
This is important.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, right... But we need to get going...  
to the next dimensional distortion.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
True. That's enough prepping, we will continue the lecture as in-field studies.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Our goal this time is to repair a space that became unstable due to the last Rayshift.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The problem should have fixed itself when we restored the timeline, but a little remained.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
My analysis shows that a number of phantasmal species, AKA dragons, have fled there.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If we don't fix it, the distortion may cause a wide-scale dimensional collapse.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So the distortion isn't disappearing because of the dragon's magical energy, right?  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Phantasmal species...dragons in particular generate magical energy just by breathing.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
The output of such energy is capable of maintaining the distortion.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's go then, Senpai.  
Doctor, send us there.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay, this is an irregular Rayshift, but it's all set.  
Fujimaru, go slay us some dragons.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So this is the dimensional distortion...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Looks like you made it.  
But this...It's like another world.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
It's a rare phenomenon, but I'm detecting draconic essence from our surroundings.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Let's take a photo to record this.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is that...a camera?  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Yes, Master let me borrow it.  
There were none in my time.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
It is a truly powerful relic that instantly paints what you see.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
At first, I just collected the paintings, but lately I've gotten into it.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Look at this new lens for instance!  
Photography is a fascinating and endless abyss.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Glad you like it.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Relic...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Georgios:**   
Thank you for this wonderful present.  
I shall repay you with my blade.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hey, no time for talking!  
They're here! Three of them!  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Master, be careful.  
Let's be on our way, then!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Mash:**   
We did it, Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We killed the dragons!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is this all?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Georgios:**   
No, these were a lower subspecies of dragon called wyverns.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
These wyverns lack the magical energy to maintain such a space as this.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, defeating them didn't change anything.  
Hmm, I'll trace the reaction...W-What the heck?  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
...There it is. Prepare the cam...  
I mean, prepare for combat.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This reaction's incredible...  
It's three times bigger than a normal dragon!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I mean, there aren't really normal dragons, but...  
What's going on here?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A mutation...or something like it?  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
No, nothing so simple.  
It feels as if it's absorbed the others.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Absorbed them?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You mean it ate them?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Georgios:**   
Yes, I've never seen a cannibalistic dragon before.  
&mdash;It has power, but little intelligence.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Either way, it's still a rare species.  
Let me take a photograph.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You can do that later!  
But if it ate the other dragons...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A dragon's just a giant lump of magical energy...  
If it ate them all...this thing is crazy!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mr. Geo, how do we deal with this?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mr. Geo...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What do we do?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Georgios:**   
Calm down, Mash. Your teacher's name is Mr. Georgios, not Mr. Geo.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
And it doesn't matter what kind of dragon it is, none shall survive our attack.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Dragons were born to be eradicated.  
Be punished for your sins, dragon!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's go, Master!  
  
  
**--BATTLE--:**  
  
**Georgios:**   
This is the end, take this!  
Ascalon!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
D-Did we get it...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Man, that was one tough enemy, huh?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, now that the dragon's gone, the distortion is starting to close.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'll bring you guys back, get ready.  
Setting coordinates now...  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
&ndash;Nameless dragon of another world, rest in peace.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Teacher...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Aren't dragons sinners?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Georgios:**   
Even if dragons are sinners born to be destroyed, that doesn't mean they deserve to be destroyed.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
&ndash;Sin and punishment should be separate things.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, we need to go or the distortion will close...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go, Teacher.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Georgios:**   
Yes...  
Oh, let me get one last photo...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Forget about that!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou.
