## Prologue  
  
**Mash:**  ───We've reached the hostile Singularity.  
  
**Mash:**  It's just as Chaldea predicted, this Singularity is structurally a miniature world———  
  
**Mash:**  a conceptual universe.  
  
**Mash:**  A microscale model case of the universe, so to speak...  
  
**Mash:**  The fact that there is only one life form present within this universe is of particular note.  
  
**Mash:**  The Beast of Calamity. The Evil of Humanity which manifests in civilizations that have  
  
**Mash:**  reached their height of prosperity and are now past their transitional period. Beast VI.  
  
**Mash:**  Our operational objective is the annihilation of Beast VI.  
  
**Mash:**  We will hereby commence the Last Order!  
  
**Merlin:**  ───Woah there! Looks like I've made it in the nick of time once again.  
  
**Merlin:**  Last Order, now that's a weighty phrase. Yes, that's the spirit!  
  
**Mash:**  !  
  
**Merlin:**  If this battle is to be the final one, then it will truly be the climax of this journey.  
  
**Merlin:**  And in that case, that leaves me no choice but to cheer you on from the front row!  
  
**Merlin:**  After all, your journey is one that I, Merlin, have acknowledged!  
  
**Mash:**  ───Merlin!  
  
**Merlin:**  Hey there, long time no see!  
  
**Merlin:**  I am glad to see you are doing well, Mash Kyrielight and Master of Chaldea.  
  
**Mash:**  Yes, Merlin! No...  
  
**Mash:**  Lady Merlin of another world! It's been a while!  
  
**Merlin:**  Yes, yes. Now there's a good look and a solid voice!  
  
**Merlin:**  You did well to stay true to yourself without bending or breaking,  
  
**Merlin:**  in spite of the harsh journeys you have experienced.  
  
**Merlin:**  I am in awe of that brilliance. So much, in fact, that I ran all the way here on foot!  
  
**Merlin:**  Now then, I'll be helping you out even more than last time!  
  
**Mash:**  Thank you very much! This is very reassuring, isn't it, Senpai?  
  
**Merlin:**  Oh, one more thing.  
  
**Merlin:**  Fufufufufufufu.  
  
**Merlin:**  This is going to be a sight to behold. (Grinning)  
  
**Mash:**  ?  
  
**Merlin:**  (Smiling)  
  
**Merlin:**  ───I'm not the only one who came here today!  
  
## Orleans Pre-Battle  
  
**First Hassan:**  ───Understood.  
  
**First Hassan:**  For starters, we advance and crush the first Demon Beast Incarnadine.  
  
**Mash:**  You're...?  
  
**Merlin:**  Didn't I just tell you? I'm not the only one who came rushing over.  
  
**Merlin:**  He is the one who wanders the boundary of death!  
  
**Merlin:**  The “Old Man of the Mountain”, a title passed down in the shadows of history.  
  
**Merlin:**  He is the first and greatest of them all, the black mask of death!  
  
**Merlin:**  His True Name is Hassan-i-Sabbah───  
  
**Merlin:**  One of the Heroic Spirits who claims the <ruby>Station of the Crown<rt>Grand seat</rt></ruby>, fated to hunt Beasts,  
  
**Merlin:**  summoned here through the Decisive Magecraft: Heroic Spirit Summoning.  
  
**Merlin:**  The Grand Assassin himself!  
  
**First Hassan:**  I am naught but a phantom that writhes in the dark...  
  
**First Hassan:**  Yet now the Evening Bell tolls. Let us go.  
  
**Mash:**  The Evening Bell───  
  
**Merlin:**  “The fateful moment is upon us! I shall lend you my strength as a special favor”,  
  
**Merlin:**  is what he's trying to say!  
  
**First Hassan:**  ...  
  
**First Hassan:**  I shall be your guide. This way.  
  
**Mash:**  Ah!  
  
**Mash:**  Look, senpai! In the wake of the Old Man of the Mountain's advance...  
  
**Merlin:**  The fluttering petals of magical energy are beautiful, huh? Fufufufufu.  
  
**Merlin:**  Sorry, but that's my handiwork.  
  
**Merlin:**  If we're going to be guiding you anyway,  
  
**Merlin:**  I figured an easily understandable approach would be better.  
  
**First Hassan:**  You needn't bother yourself. You need not adorn their deaths with flowers.  
  
**Merlin:**  Come now, don't say that. We're fellow Grands after all, aren't we?  
  
**First Hassan:**  So says the pseudo-fairy who has ignored her <ruby>Station of the Crown<rt>Grand seat</rt></ruby> to act as she pleases.  
  
**Merlin:**  Whatever could you mean by that?  
  
**Mash:**  (I wonder what they're talking about?)  
  
**Merlin:**  Now then, about the first Demon Beast Incarnadine───  
  
**Merlin:**  Shaving off magical energy of this scale all on our own is going to prove rather troublesome.  
  
**Merlin:**  Not to mention there's seven of these!  
  
**Merlin:**  Or so I thought, however...  
  
**Merlin:**  It looks like someone already beat us to the punch. Look over there, Mash!  
  
**Mash:**  !?  
  
**Kiyohime:**  Uncle! Uncle Vlad, please go easy now, umm!  
  
**Vlad:**  I have every intention of holding back───  
  
**Vlad:**  But you're doing a fine job evading my Noble Phantasm. Keep it up.  
  
**Kiyohime:**  Uncle!?  
  
**Elisabeth:**  Wow, uncle Vlad's merciless! Wowowowowow.  
  
**Elisabeth:**  Won't he end up Bey'ing us too? Are you sure this is okay?  
  
**Carmilla:**  There is no way Lord Vlad would blunder like that.  
  
**Carmilla:**  More importantly, we should provide support.  
  
**Carmilla:**  We will exterminate the first Demon Beast Incarnadine here.  
  
**Elisabeth:**  Fine, fine! Let's do this───Boe~!  
  
**Mash:**  ...!  
  
**Mash:**  Master, Master! Those people are...!  
  
**Mash:**  The Servants who stood against us in the first Singularity!  
  
**Mash:**  They're all attacking the Demon Beast Incarnadine in unison───  
  
**Jeanne:**  Yes... This is undoubtedly a miracle.  
  
**Jeanne:**  What you see before you are “Heroic Spirits” as they should have been!  
  
**Jeanne:**  We, existences engraved in the history woven by man,  
  
**Jeanne:**  were meant to stand with the Human Order.  
  
**Jeanne:**  Now that we are free from the yoke of the Holy Grail's distortion and curse───  
  
**Jeanne:**  We shall unite our forces to aid you, Chaldea!  
  
**Marie:**  Yes, yes! This time, we can all get along and have a party!  
  
**Marie:**  Vive la France, Master!  
  
**Marie:**  I'm glad I got to greet you again!  
  
**Mash:**  Jeanne! Marie!  
  
**Martha:**  Rather rowdy for a party...oh, I see. So that's how it is.  
  
**Martha:**  We are to hold a grand banquet on this triumphant day!  
  
**Chevalier d'Eon:**  As you command, Your Highness!  
  
**Chevalier d'Eon:**  I shall bear the banner of the royal family's fleur-de-lis at this party!  
  
**Chevalier d'Eon:**  O Demon Beast Incarnadine, inauspicious red flower of evil.  
  
**Chevalier d'Eon:**  You have no place in the banquet of the Human Order!  
  
**Phantom of the Opera:**  Dance, dance, Demon Beast Incarnadine. Dance the Danse Macabre before us───  
  
**Mozart:**  Oh, the Phantom appears to be in good spirits. Now there's a rare sight!  
  
**Mozart:**  And Maria appears much the same to me. Is there even a need to take this seriously then?  
  
**Mash:**  Amadeus!  
  
**Mozart:**  Hello, milady. We meet again. It would appear I have made it in time for the final performance.  
  
**Mash:**  Yes!  
  
**Jeanne:**  I'm here too, you know...? Why am I on your side?  
  
**Gilles de Rais:**  Oh, Jeanne. Puffing up those beautiful cheeks of hers...could it be that she is sulking?  
  
**Gilles de Rais:**  Do you wish to stand against Chaldea, even after your second summoning as an Apostle of Lust?  
  
**Jeanne:**  Shut it! I'll immolate you!  
  
**Mash:**  Master...everyone came rushing over to this final battle.  
  
**Mash:**  We cannot afford to fall behind either!  
  
**Mash:**  Commencing anti-Demon Beast Incarnadine combat!  
  
## Orleans Post-Battle and Septem Part 1  
  
**Jeanne:**  The path has been cleared! Please, keep moving forward, don't look back!  
  
**Merlin:**  The first Demon Beast Incarnadine has been silenced!  
  
**Merlin:**  I'd love for us to take a break, but we don't have time. I'm sorry.  
  
**Merlin:**  Both of you, let's move onto the next one!  
  
**Mash:**  Understood!  
  
**First Hassan:**  This way───follow me.  
  
**Elisabeth:**  Get it together, you hear me!?  
  
**Elisabeth:**  There'll be hell to pay if you give up halfway through!  
  
**Jeanne:**  Best of luck!  
  
**Marie:**  Vive la France!  
  
---  
  
**Nero:**  ...  
  
**Nero:**  What am I doing here...?  
  
**Nero:**  Where am I? Just now, I was...  
  
**Nero:**  Perhaps I was in my chambers, or perhaps under some faraway skies───  
  
**Nero:**  In either case, I came to below a different sky altogether,  
  
**Nero:**  on a stage of convergence seemingly set up to determine the fate of the world.  
  
**Nero:**  As one would expect, there is a lot I have yet to understand.  
  
**Nero:**  What I do understand, however, is what needs to be done!  
  
**Nero:**  Namely, this situation requires us to fight! Mash! And Chaldea's Master!  
  
**Mash:**  Emperor Nero───!  
  
**Nero:**  I don't know the full extent of things, but this is what needs to be done.  
  
**Nero:**  Can we presume that pillar-like thing is our enemy?  
  
**Mash:**  Y-yes! According to incoming communications from Chaldea,  
  
**Mash:**  its provisional name is Demon God Pillar Flauros! The second Demon Beast Incarnadine!  
  
**Mash:**  We fought it once before, in the second Singularity...  
  
**Mash:**  I don't suppose Your Highness would remember that...?  
  
**Nero:**  You'd be correct! Frankly, I must confess that I don't remember much at all!  
  
**Nero:**  But my soul remembers that I once fought beside you Chaldeans!  
  
**Nero:**  Thus, I shall brandish this blade of meteoric iron with all my being! As a fellow comrade-in-arms!  
  
**Merlin:**  Take it all in, Old Man of the Mountain. This is what you'd call a miracle, isn't it?  
  
**Merlin:**  You know about Her Majesty the red emperor, I take it?  
  
**Merlin:**  The living person, keeping their karmic destiny concealed within their body,  
  
**Merlin:**  who they met in that Singularity.  
  
**Merlin:**  They borrowed the Saint Graph of the very same existence, etched into the Throne,  
  
**Merlin:**  and ultimately charged headfirst into battle.  
  
**Merlin:**  Fufufu, amazing, amazing! That's two or three miracles achieved by this point, isn't it!?  
  
**Merlin:**  Just how many impossibilities will be overturned!? Truly beautiful!  
  
**Merlin:**  At the end of the headache that young woman endures───  
  
**Merlin:**  The Beast of Love will be hard pressed!  
  
**First Hassan:**  ......  
  
**First Hassan:**  If the founder of the seven hills were here, he'd say it.  
  
**Merlin:**  Hm?  
  
**First Hassan:**  ───Rome! Just that one word!  
  
**First Hassan:**  Miracles in times of crisis. Fraternity owing itself to the battlefield.  
  
**First Hassan:**  These things are all part of <ruby>romance<rt>Rome</rt></ruby>───that's what he'd say.  
  
## Septem Part 2  
  
**Nero:**  Ggh...! A migraine, now of all times...!  
  
**Boudica:**  Ah, jeez. Don't just rush on ahead like that. We're relying on you for leadership, you know.  
  
**Nero:**  Oh, Boudica!  
  
**Nero:**  Ah yes...I remember now. You were my enemy once.  
  
**Nero:**  The dreaded warlord who once stood against my Rome, fighting alongside me now!  
  
**Boudica:**  Looks like it. I was your enemy once upon a time, but some things happened and, well, y'know.  
  
**Boudica:**  Now, take a look.  
  
**Boudica:**  The greatest allied army in history awaits your command, and so do the generals leading it!  
  
**Caesar:**  Hah hah hah hah! This time we meet not in opposition, but as comrades!  
  
**Caesar:**  Narrowly escaping the grasp of his beloved Cleopatra,  
  
**Caesar:**  here to behold the skill of the fifth Emperor,  
  
**Caesar:**  Julius Caesar has come to conquer! Rejoice, all of you!  
  
**Caligula:**  Ooooooooh...!! Rome...immortal...Demon Beast Incarnadine...DESTROY...!  
  
**Caligula:**  DESTROOOOOOY!!  
  
**Nero:**  Uncle!? And Lord Caesar!  
  
**Caesar:**  And we are not alone!  
  
**Caesar:**  O Heroic Spirits who have devoted yourselves to the training of the Divine Ancestor!  
  
**Caesar:**  Come forth!  
  
**Leonidas I:**  Nwaaaaaaaaaah! My body is rejuvenated through the strength of your war cries!  
  
**Leonidas I:**  Lancer, Leonidas I! Reporting for duty!  
  
**Mash:**  King Leonidas...!  
  
**Leonidas I:**  Sparta's patron god is Ares, also known as Mars!  
  
**Leonidas I:**  And now, I have received the tutelage of his son, the Divine Ancestor!  
  
**Leonidas I:**  Truly, I am the god of war made manifest!  
  
**Leonidas I:**  Allow me to lend you his power, O Fifth Emperor of Rome!  
  
**Nero:**  King Leonidas of Sparta! You too would side with me...!  
  
**Nero:**  Wait a minute. Who is this Divine Ancestor you keep mentioning?  
  
**Lord El-Melloi II:**  You don't know...? Well, you should.  
  
**Nero:**  The alliance's strategist! Your name was...  
  
**Lord El-Melloi II:**  Zhuge Liang. Well, it's Lord El-Melloi II at present.  
  
**Lord El-Melloi II:**  To those of you from the Human Security Organization Chaldea,  
  
**Lord El-Melloi II:**  I will tell you the truth as a mage of the Clock Tower.  
  
**Lord El-Melloi II:**  I don't know about the other domains, but as for this one...  
  
**Lord El-Melloi II:**  Many of the Heroic Spirits gathered here have temporarily manifested  
  
**Lord El-Melloi II:**  with the assistance of Rome's Divine Founder.  
  
**Nero:**  Th-that...  
  
**Lord El-Melloi II:**  The father of Rome. You might know him better as Romulus, the Founding King.  
  
**Lord El-Melloi II:**  Or as he is now, Romulus-Quirinus.  
  
**Lord El-Melloi II:**  Son of the war god, and one of the three supreme deities of Rome!  
  
**Nero:**  !!!  
  
**Altera:**  The war god has my respect. If his son commands so, then I shall heed his words.  
  
**Altera:**  So, I too have come.  
  
**Altera:**  Rome has spoken. All of you are good civilization.  
  
**Altera:**  And Nero. Emperor Nero. You...  
  
**Altera:**  Because you were kind to me in that distant sky...  
  
**Altera:**  I shall protect you this time... The me here and now shall destroy the Demon Beast Incarnadine.  
  
**Mash:**  Altera! The Heroic Spirit of Destruction!  
  
**Mash:**  Otherwise known as King Atilla, the Scourge of God!  
  
**Nero:**  ...!  
  
**Nero:**  Aaaah, I don't know how much more I can take!  
  
**Nero:**  T-the Divine Ancestor would lend his power to me!? To Chaldea!?  
  
**Nero:**  I don't understand this at all!  
  
**Nero:**  I don't understand...  
  
**Nero:**  But despite that! Right now, all of Rome is within my grasp!  
  
**Nero:**  As the Divine Ancestor once said to his father, the god of war!  
  
**Nero:**  There is enough light in mankind to nurture a heart that loves all!  
  
**Nero:**  History is rife with that which denies it to be the case.  
  
**Nero:**  And so we behold the dread form of the Demon Beast Incarnadine!  
  
**Nero:**  This would stop us in our tracks? How laughable.  
  
**Nero:**  Even the Age of Gods must come to an end.  
  
**Nero:**  Once, our very own Roman Empire proved that to be true!  
  
**Nero:**  The Age of Man is the Age of Romance!  
  
**Merlin:**  (Seriously...?)  
  
**Nero:**  Man loves his fellow man...  
  
**Mash:**  Love───  
  
**Boudica:**  ......  
  
**Nero:**  That is what I dream of! That is what Rome is!  
  
**Nero:**  Thus I declare! Advance! And conquer!  
  
**Nero:**  Our arms pave the way for all! Our love shall one day reach the heavens themselves!  
  
**Romans:**  UUUUUUUUUURAAAAAAAAH! HAIL THE DIVINE ANCESTOR! HAIL EMPEROR NERO CLAUDIUS!  
  
**Nero:**  !?  
  
**Boudica:**  That's the thousands of soldiers supporting you.  
  
**Boudica:**  They swear allegiance neither to Alliance nor Empire, but to Rome itself.  
  
**Romans:**  HAIL THE EMPEROR! HAIL, OUR NERO CLAUDIUS!  
  
**Nero:**  Yes...yes...!  
  
**Nero:**  Don your crimson and gold! I and Rome promise you glory and victory!  
  
**Nero:**  This Beast shall know by what means it falls.  
  
**Nero:**  And it shall see that even if this band of despair envelops the sky,  
  
**Nero:**  that light shall never fade.  
  
**Nero:**  My abominable migraine has vanished! I see clearly now!  
  
**Nero:**  Let the decisive battle begin!  
  
## Septem Post-Battle and Okeanos Part 1  
  
**Mash:**  The second Demon Beast Incarnadine has been silenced!  
  
**Altera:**  Yes...we sync well together. As expected of an emperor.  
  
**Nero:**  You certainly seem to be used to it, too.  
  
**Nero:**  It almost feels like this isn't the first time we've been in battle together!  
  
**Lord El-Melloi II:**  It has the same level of power as the thing  
  
**Lord El-Melloi II:**  that caused my apprentice's Holy Lance to go crazy...  
  
**Lord El-Melloi II:**  Certainly, you've endured it well.  
  
**Merlin:**  Amazing... You actually survived the pull of the Beast.  
  
**Merlin:**  She truly is an impressive emperor. Or rather, that's what humanity is all about.  
  
**Merlin:**  That's the way it should be!  
  
**Nero:**  ?  
  
**Merlin:**  Well then, let's go!  
  
**First Hassan:**  ───This way to the third domain.  
  
**Nero:**  Mash, Master of Chaldea! Head on!  
  
**Nero:**  My Roman legion and I will take care of this area. You may go forth.  
  
**Nero:**  This world will never end, for all roads lead to our seven hills!  
  
**Nero:**  Forward! Conquer!  
  
**Nero:**  Our steps will open up the Rome of tomorrow!  
  
---  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Feast upon the accumulated gold and riches, you say...?  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Gold! Riches! I can't very well ignore those now, can I?  
  
**Francis Drake:**  In all ages and cultures, such straightforward treasures have always been pillaged.  
  
**Francis Drake:**  In other words, this is our forté.  
  
**Francis Drake:**  You're gonna have to hand it all over, your life included, got it?  
  
**Francis Drake:**  I am fully aware of how impudent I'm being here, having just arrived and all.  
  
**Francis Drake:**  But it is what it is, no? After all, we're pirates!  
  
**Pirate:**  Whew! Our big sis's super cool───!  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Yeah, we'll do this as merrily as usual, you swabbies!  
  
**Francis Drake:**  We'll do what we've always done, no matter who or what our enemy is!  
  
**Francis Drake:**  We'll pillage and drink and raise hell!  
  
**Pirates:**  You can say that again, Boss! We're the crew of the Golden Hind!  
  
**Pirates:**  We'll follow you anywhere, sis!! Woo-hoo!!  
  
**Merlin:**  Woo-hoo! Playing along like this once in a while isn't too bad!  
  
**Mash:**  W-woo-hoo! Captain Drake and her pirate crew are in good spirits!  
  
**Mash:**  A miracle's unfolding here too───there's more than one pirate galleon here, Master!  
  
**Pirate:**  Woah! There's another ship portside!  
  
**Mash:**  That's...the Queen Anne's Revenge!  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Heh, is that so? So he's here too, is he?  
  
**Francis Drake:**  A pain in the ass he may be, but you can count on him.  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Heeey, Teach! Can you hear me!? What'll it be?  
  
**Blackbeard:**  Hmph. The one who fells you shall be none other than I...  
  
**Blackbeard:**  I couldn't possibly let someone else take up that role, now can I───  
  
**Atalante:**  That's enough of that. Steer properly or else we'll end up ramming that pillar of flesh.  
  
**Blackbeard:**  Fine, fine! Cat-ears here has a rough way of treating her captain!  
  
**Blackbeard:**  Alright, boyos! Keep pace with the ha──Drake's ship!  
  
**Blackbeard:**  Bold of you to steal a pirate's treasure!  
  
**Blackbeard:**  I don't care whether you're a demonic beast or a devil───  
  
**Blackbeard:**  Go and regret in hell ever having laid hands on this great pirate Blackbeard's treasure!  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Well, well, looks like that oaf's all fired up! Listen up, boys, don't you dare fall behind!  
  
**Francis Drake:**  If we end up crashing and burning before him,  
  
**Francis Drake:**  you lot are gonna be scrubbing the head in hell for a lifetime!  
  
**Pirates:**  Aye-aye, big sis!  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Cannons on the ready, Golden Hind!  
  
**Blackbeard:**  Prep those cannons, Queen Anne's Revenge!  
  
## Okeanos Part 2  
  
**Mash:**  Incoming message from Chaldea!  
  
**Mash:**  It seems like the reconstructed cannon has successfully been materialized!  
  
**Merlin:**  Oh, we can use this! Well aren't you capable of some interesting things?  
  
**Merlin:**  Taking Chaldea's records of the Golden Hind and materializing it in a fluid etheric mass, hm?  
  
**Merlin:**  Hmm. I see, I see.  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Eh?  
  
**Francis Drake:**  This cannon...looks an awful lot like ours, don't it?  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Is it from the same gunsmith? Or could it...no, it couldn't be.  
  
**Pirate:**  Haah, haah, haah...Cap'n, all our gunports're full up.  
  
**Pirate:**  Don't look like we're missin' any.  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Well, don't that beat all? Seriously takes a load off my mind.  
  
**Francis Drake:**  It's a pain in the ass havin' to keelhaul your own crew before a battle.  
  
**Pirate:**  Heh. Don't have to tell me!  
  
**Merlin:**  ...  
  
**Merlin:**  Hey Mash, Master of Chaldea. Something just occurred to me.  
  
**Merlin:**  If you taught the 21st-century definition of copy protection and piracy to these genuine pirates...  
  
**Merlin:**  What do you think would──mmmph.  
  
**Mash:**  P-p-please excuse me, Merlin, but please shut up for now!  
  
**Mash:**  We really don't need you to go down that train of thought...!  
  
**First Hassan:**  ... (reads the mood and keeps quiet.)  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Hey, what are you fussin' about over there?  
  
**Heracles:**  (RRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrRRRRRRRRRR)  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Gah, my ears! Wait, was that the legendary hero himself!?  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Sorry about that! I'd be a damned fool to turn down help from you!  
  
**Medea Lily:**  I am here as well! This time, I too shall offer my support!  
  
**Pirates:**  !?  
  
**Pirates:**  Aaaaah! The wiiiiitch!  
  
**Medea Lily:**  Ah...  
  
**Medea Lily:**  Um, no! It's okay! For whatever reason, I don't have that intense desire this time,  
  
**Medea Lily:**  and because Lord Jason has asked me and Heracles to take care of you,  
  
**Medea Lily:**  both Heracles and I are on your side!  
  
**Heracles:**  (RRRRRRRrrrrrrrRRRRRRR)  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Well, well. Looks like we're gonna get along.  
  
**Francis Drake:**  All right! We've got the legendary Argonauts on our side!  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Now this is what I'm talkin' about! Listen up, you dogs!  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Don't underestimate her just because she looks like a princess!  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Little Miss Witch here is one of the original pirates!  
  
**Francis Drake:**  She went on the hunt for the first hidden treasure!  
  
**Francis Drake:**  There's no room for poor manners here──and of course, the rudest thing you can do is lose!  
  
**Pirates:**  AYE-AYE, CAP'N! AYE AYE, MISS WITCH!  
  
**Medea Lily:**  U-um...I'll do my best!  
  
**Blackbeard:**  Ooh, seems like they're getting fired up over there. Gettin' kind of jealous.  
  
**Atalante:**  Are you displeased with me, Captain?  
  
**Blackbeard:**  Oh no no no no no, not at all! Now let's get rolling!  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Hey! Don't let Teach and his crew steal all the glory!  
  
**First Hassan:**  ───Demon Beast Incarnadine, offer up thy head!  
  
## Okeanos Post-Battle and London Part 1  
  
**Merlin:**  The Third Demon Beast Incarnadine has been silenced!  
  
**Blackbeard:**  Whew. Ended up taking this just a wee bit seriously.  
  
**Blackbeard:**  Surely there's no need to even mention who the MVP is!  
  
**Atalante:**  That would be Heracles. Although that skull man's skill with a greatsword is a sight to behold.  
  
**Atalante:**  I certainly would not call it uncontested, you know?  
  
**Blackbeard:**  ...  
  
**Atalante:**  What's wrong, Teach?  
  
**Blackbeard:**  No, I'm...actually depressed right now, please leave me be...  
  
**Atalante:**  ?  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Not too shabby, Teach! Quite daring by your standards, I'd say!  
  
**Francis Drake:**  I like it. Where'd you learn to steer like that?  
  
**Blackbeard:**  Hey, hag...! Where do you get off spitting lines like that at a man when he's down!?  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Who the hell are you calling a hag?  
  
**Blackbeard:**  ───Blegh.  
  
**Mash:**  Oh! Blackbeard got...flattened...!  
  
**Merlin:**  Ahahahaha. How nice, it almost makes me want to rest on my laurels.  
  
**Merlin:**  But we've got to press forward. Mash, Master.  
  
**First Hassan:**  ───Let us be off.  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Woah, are you going already? I guess I've got to give at least one gun salute.  
  
**Francis Drake:**  Stay safe, Chaldeans!  
  
**Medea Lily:**  Take care!  
  
**Pirates:**  Make sure to stay alive, you hear me!? ───See ya later!  
  
---  
  
**Mordred:**  Yeah... There's an end to everything.  
  
**Mordred:**  That majestic castle, shining proudly, will collapse.  
  
**Mordred:**  Those armored knights bearing arms will die all the same too.  
  
**Mordred:**  Even the world will end someday.  
  
**Mordred:**  But not at the hands of a Demon Beast Incarnadine. Not at all.  
  
**Mordred:**  The end of the world ain't a lousy spectacle like this without a soul to attend to it.  
  
**Mordred:**  On the contrary, it's the end for you bastards. You've already had your fill, haven't you?  
  
**Mordred:**  Then it's the end for you. I'll put you out of your misery!  
  
**Mash:**  We've reached the fourth domain! Mordred has already commenced her assault!  
  
**Mash:**  However───  
  
**Merlin:**  There are two Demon Beast Incarnadines here. A twin type one, more specifically.  
  
**Merlin:**  One of them's the Control Tower and the other one's the assault apparatus.  
  
**Merlin:**  You can't afford to waste your magical energy carelessly.  
  
**Merlin:**  Of the two, you'll need to accurately strike at the Control Tower.  
  
**Mordred:**  Shut it! Who the hell are you!?  
  
**Mordred:**  I just have to pulverize both of them!  
  
**Tamamo:**  Oh, I wonder about that.  
  
**Tamamo:**  It's a coin toss as to whether you're wasting your time if you charge in recklessly, you know?  
  
**Mordred:**  So you mean there's a fifty-fifty chance that I'll hit the jackpot?  
  
**Mash:**  Mordred, Tamamo-no-Mae!  
  
**Mordred:**  Hey, Mash! The Chaldean Master's along for the ride too, eh!?  
  
**Merlin:**  (Grinning)  
  
**Mordred:**  Hm.  
  
**Mordred:**  You're...not Merlin...are you...?  
  
**Mordred:**  That floweriness makes you feel kind of similar...  
  
**Mordred:**  But you're a woman and all───  
  
**Merlin:**  Ahahahahaha!  
  
**Merlin:**  Close but no cigar! I'm not that person you're familiar with, I'm Merlin from a different timeline.  
  
**Merlin:**  Needless to say, I'm not male. Although I am the Magus of Flowers───  
  
**Merlin:**  Your flowery big sis who's been cheering you on this whole time as you strived for your ideals!  
  
**Mordred:**  Huh?  
  
**Tamamo:**  Let's think of her as a relative of Merlin's, shall we?  
  
**Tamamo:**  Nonetheless, Mash and the Master of Chaldea. It's been a while,  
  
**Tamamo:**  and you've made quite a few new companions───  
  
**Merlin:**  Fufu.  
  
**Tamamo:**  It would appear you've become acquainted with quite a lot of heavy hitters.  
  
**Tamamo:**  After all, they both qualify for the position of Grand.  
  
**Tamamo:**  And...eh?  
  
**Tamamo:**  T-that person there! With the skull!  
  
**Tamamo:**  He's not just qualified for the seat of Grand! He's already a Grand Heroic Spirit!  
  
**First Hassan:**  I am indeed, O Radiant Tail Of The Heavens.  
  
**First Hassan:**  I am the Old Man of the Mountain, Hassan-i-Sabbah.  
  
**Tamamo:**  Mikon! C-could it be that you're the founder!?  
  
**Merlin:**  Indeed he is! After all, this battle is the climax!  
  
**Merlin:**  Where all worthy Heroic Spirits assemble!  
  
**Mordred:**  Hah. I don't know what you're babbling on about,  
  
**Mordred:**  but looks like you're some bigwig or something.  
  
**Mordred:**  I'll fight alongside you and we'll see if you're all that.  
  
**Mordred:**  We've got two enemies. One's the head and the other's like an extension of its hand.  
  
**Mordred:**  That simplifies matters! We'll keep hitting and striking them!  
  
**Mordred:**  I'll say it again───we just have to pulverize the both of them!!  
  
## London Part 2  
  
**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** ──────Exactly so.  
  
**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** You speak truthfully, O Nameless Knight.  
  
**Mordred:**  !  
  
**Mash:**  That's───  
  
**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** I am but another what-if of myself, from beneath a different sky.  
  
**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** One that springs from holding the Holy Lance, on the verge of apotheosis,  
  
**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** yet clinging to the slimmest of chances of remaining myself.  
  
**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** The possibility of retaining my identity while wielding the power of the Lance.  
  
**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** The possibility of accepting the curse of the Grail.  
  
**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** A version of myself unable to act as a king, as my nature is that of the storm.  
  
**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** That...is what I am.  
  
**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** Nothing more than a storm which ravages that which lies before me.  
  
**Mordred:**  I have heard your words! Father──no, Storm King, leader of the Wild Hunt!  
  
**Mordred:**  You're the one who destroys everything! Even me!  
  
**Mordred:**  And especially those two Demon Beast Incarnadines!  
  
**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** No. Today all that lies before me is the head of that beast.  
  
**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** I am blind to any Heroic Spirits attempting to save the world───  
  
**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** Holy Lance, removing restraints.  
  
**First Hassan:**  Oh...?  
  
**Merlin:**  Hahahahaha! Behold, the light of the tower that anchors the ends of the world!  
  
**Merlin:**  You don't see this every day! Too bad for you, Beast VI!  
  
**Merlin:**  It's just too bad we're only at one of the heads, and not at the main body!  
  
**Mordred:**  ...  
  
**Tamamo:**  Mordred?  
  
**Mordred:**  Like this? On this battlefield? What a sick joke. Am I supposed to be thankful for this?  
  
**Mordred:**  Welp, it's gone so far it's actually refreshing! I'm finally fighting alongside Father!  
  
**Mordred:**  And we're finally on the same wavelength: just trash everything in front of us!  
  
**Mordred:**  If this is a dream, it's a freakin' amazing one! I'm gonna enjoy this to its fullest!  
  
**Jack the Ripper:**  Are you happy to be with your Mummy?  
  
**Mordred:**  Yeah, I sure am.  
  
**Mordred:**  Wait───that's my Father, not my mom!  
  
**Jack the Ripper:**  (All smiles)  
  
**Mordred:**  Hey──you're Jack! What, have you manifested as our ally now?  
  
**Mordred:**  That's great! This doesn't happen a lot, so let's go smash some faces together!  
  
**Jack the Ripper:**  Yeah!  
  
**Mordred:**  Now, let's rock and rooooooll!  
  
## London Post-Battle and E Pluribus Unum Part 1  
  
**Mash:**  Fourth Demon Beast Incarnadine, patterns A and B have both been silenced!  
  
**Mordred:**  What...that's it?  
  
**Mordred:**  Aw man, what a letdown. I thought I'd finally be able to run amok with Father.  
  
**Mordred:**  Ah, whatever. Was still a good fight.  
  
**Tamamo:**  Well, I suppose. Speaking comparatively, of course.  
  
**Merlin:**  Yep, yep.  
  
**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** ...  
  
**Mordred:**  Sheesh. Those two sure aren't happy.  
  
**Mordred:**  Thanks, Mash. You too, Master of Chaldea.  
  
**Mordred:**  Why I'm still here, or why records of what happened before are still around...  
  
**Mordred:**  I don't really get it at all, but I'm sure it's because of you two.  
  
**Tamamo:**  Why are you making it sound so final!? We aren't done here yet, you know!  
  
**Tamamo:**  We'll take charge of this domain now, so please go on ahead.  
  
**Tamamo:**  And please be careful. The trials ahead will be just as taxing, or even more so──  
  
**Jack the Ripper:**  They're strong, but that's okay. You can do it.  
  
**Mash:**  Yes...!  
  
**Merlin:**  That's right. Even should a strong enemy block our way,  
  
**Merlin:**  that wouldn't stop Mash and Master's pace, would it?  
  
**Merlin:**  You guys know exactly what I mean, don't you? Fufufufu!  
  
**Mordred:**  Yeah, sure do...  
  
**Tamamo:**  Well, so it goes. But be on your guard all the same!  
  
**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter):** ──Farewell.  
  
**First Hassan:**  ──Mm.  
  
**Mash:**  We're off! Now...let's keep going, Senpai!  
  
**Nightingale:**  Pathogenic bacterium again...?  
  
**Nightingale:**  Their extermination is truly quite an ordeal. There is no other way but to change the world.  
  
**Scathach:**  Oh, don't say that. If we're overcome here, then there is no hope for the Human Order.  
  
**Scathach:**  Besides, it doesn't appear such a surgical approach is necessary.  
  
**Scathach:**  Look───the first responders are already here!  
  
**Mash:**  Master, we've reached the fifth domain!  
  
**Mash:**  Nightingale! Scathach!  
  
**Sita:**  I'm here as well, Mash!  
  
**Mash:**  Oh, Sita's here too!  
  
**Merlin:**  Hey, it's been a while since I've seen the three of you. Good to see you're all still doing well!  
  
**Sita:**  Yes, and you too, Merlin!  
  
**Scathach:**  Well, what do you think now, Florence Nightingale?  
  
**Nightingale:**  You appear to have been correct... Very well, we will settle for symptomatic treatment this time.  
  
**Sita:**  Now, let us sally forth! Do not fear death nor pain!  
  
**Sita:**  For the Angel of Mercy is on our side!  
  
**Sita:**  The angel who hauls you up by the collar, no matter if you may be dying or on the way to Hell!  
  
**Nightingale:**  If it encourages you all, then I shall bear that moniker for now.  
  
**Nightingale:**  Ahem...  
  
**Nightingale:**  Though, I must confess, I do find it rather embarrassing───  
  
**Scathach:**  Hahahahaha! Look, the Angel is blushing!  
  
**First Hassan:**  Thou truly art a lovely flower. No wonder pagans mistook you for an angel.  
  
**Nightingale:**  !?  
  
**Nightingale:**  The gentleman over there...this is the first time I've had the pleasure of meeting him.  
  
**Nightingale:**  And yet I feel like I've seen him before somehow...why is that?  
  
**First Hassan:**  Thou art the flower that grows alongside death. Therefore, thou mayest feel familiar with it.  
  
**First Hassan:**  But that is but an illusion.  
  
**First Hassan:**  Thy hands are for the sake of preserving life.  
  
**Nightingale:**  O-of course... What a mysterious individual...  
  
**Scathach:**  ───Now then, let us bring down this poor shade.  
  
**Scathach:**  Poor fool with no idea what it truly is.  
  
## E Pluribus Unum Part 2  
  
**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** Wait.  
  
**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** This is my prey, Master.  
  
**Scathach:**  ...!  
  
**Mash:**  Master, look! It's...  
  
**Mash:**  ───The Mad King, Cú Chulainn Alter. Our final enemy in the Fifth Singularity!  
  
**Mash:**  But he doesn't appear hostile towards us now. What's going on!?  
  
**Scathach:**  Even you showed up...I have to say, even I didn't expect this.  
  
**Scathach:**  A miracle may be occurring, but how dare you stir from your throne.  
  
**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** It's only natural that after a defeat, the loser goes over to the winner's side.  
  
**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** Forcing your own way through without letting others do the same is just hypocrisy.  
  
**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** Even if it's through mutual hate or simply killing each other, bonds once made can't be broken.  
  
**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** At the very least I can do what I'm supposed to. That's all.  
  
**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** I told you already, that shadow is my prey.  
  
**Scathach:**  I see... Well then, for now I will refrain from asking why.  
  
**Scathach:**  But how do you think Medb would feel about this?  
  
**Scathach:**  After all, she created you to rule over that Singularity.  
  
**Scathach:**  Would she be pleased or displeased to see you doing this?  
  
**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** Who knows... She could be mad or happy.  
  
**Scathach:**  !  
  
**Scathach:**  Yeah. It sure seems that way.  
  
**Scathach:**  Well...sorry to hold you up, O Mad King of Shadows!  
  
**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** ──────────  
  
**Scathach:**  Now, on to the extended final battle of the second American Civil War!  
  
**Scathach:**  I wish all you great heroes here good hunting!  
  
**Karna:**  Naturally...  
  
**Arjuna:**  Of course...  
  
**Arjuna:**  Karna... Did you ever think a day like this would come?  
  
**Arjuna:**  Not just that we would fight as partners───together...  
  
**Arjuna:**  But that we would do so in order to save something.  
  
**Karna:**  I knew it would come someday, but I did not know when.  
  
**Karna:**  I thought it might take one or two thousand years,  
  
**Karna:**  until the moon and sun washed away our feelings...  
  
**Arjuna:**  You're right. Who would have thought it would come so soon!  
  
**Arjuna:**  ───But this is fine...  
  
**Arjuna:**  I'll suppress my feelings of hatred and competitiveness with you.  
  
**Arjuna:**  For now...  
  
**Karna:**  Is that so? If anything, I was rather looking forward to our rivalry here.  
  
**Arjuna:**  ───What?  
  
**Scathach:**  Don't be so hasty, Arjuna! Karna merely wants to compete with you here!  
  
**Scathach:**  Isn't that right?  
  
**Karna:**  Yes... It appears I misspoke.  
  
**Arjuna:**  ───I see.  
  
**Scathach:**  In this world, your desire to clash with each other may not come to pass.  
  
**Scathach:**  But just endure for now. And continue to do so as we move on.  
  
**Arjuna:**  Queen of the Land of Shadows. I may not understand what you say...  
  
**Arjuna:**  But I shall agree for now. Therefore, Karna,  
  
**Arjuna:**  I'll express my hatred and jealousy towards you through exceeding your body count!  
  
**Arjuna:**  Now, ready your spear!  
  
**Karna:**  Of course. And you nock your arrows, Arjuna.  
  
**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** RRRRRRRRrrrrrrrRRRRRRRRR!  
  
**Scathach:**  Hah!  
  
**Cú Chulainn (Alter):** ───Come!  
  
**Mash:**  Demon Beast Incarnadine incoming, along with hostile Shadow Servants!  
  
## E Pluribus Unum Post-Battle and Lost Jerusalem Part 1  
  
   
  
**Mash:**  ───Hostile Shadow Servant, annihilated! The fifth Demon Beast Incarnadine has been silenced!  
  
**Scathach:**  Good...  
  
**Nightingale:**  The pathogen has been excised. However, it is little more than symptomatic treatment.  
  
**Nightingale:**  We may have succeeded in opening the gate of this domain,  
  
**Nightingale:**  but we are far from a curative treatment.  
  
**Nightingale:**  Now then, hurry along. Should you dawdle, the gate will close once more.  
  
**Nightingale:**  But first of all, we must excise the real pathogen───the root cause!  
  
**Merlin:**  How much do you even know!?  
  
**Merlin:**  Is this shrewdness a trait unique to those with a high level of Madness Enhancement?  
  
**Merlin:**  In any case, she's right. Let's hurry up, Mash. You too, Master of Chaldea!  
  
**Sita:**  Go on ahead! And please be careful!  
  
**Arjuna:**  The path has been paved. You are free to press forward!  
  
**Karna:**  ───Go now, keep moving forward!  
  
---  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  ......  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  ───I failed as a knight.  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  Apostatized as a monk, expunged as a grandmaster.  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  These regrets I harbor of having returned to ashes without achieving anything.  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  How could I possibly stand to not resolve them here and now!?  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  P-please do not stop me, Lady Leonardo da Vinci!  
  
**Da Vinci:**  There, there. There, there. Calm down, calm down.  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  How could I possibly remain calm!?  
  
**Da Vinci:**  Nevertheless, we can't have you charging the enemy all on your lonesome, can we!?  
  
**Mash:**  We've reached the sixth domain...but what's going on here!?  
  
**Mash:**  Da Vinci is restraining the Heroic Spirit Jacques de Molay!  
  
**Okada Izo:**  Hey there, Mash and the Chaldeans in tow! Do something about those idiots, will ya!?  
  
**Okada Izo:**  Heroes from all ages and places are gathering here, can't have them dying in vain now.  
  
**Medusa:**  To think even Izou would say this to him...Molay truly is a pitiable man...  
  
**Okada Izo:**  What did you say!?  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  Please unhand me, Da Vinci!  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  This humiliation of mine shall be rectified here! To do so, I would stop at nothing!  
  
**Mash:**  Eh, umm───Heroic Spirit Molay, please calm yourself!  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  I would...!  
  
**First Hassan:**  O heathen...  
  
**First Hassan:**  Is that truly resolve? Are foolhardiness and recklessness the virtues of thy god?  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  !!  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  I...I───  
  
**Da Vinci:**  Thank goodness! He's been attempting a charge and wouldn't listen to me.  
  
**Da Vinci:**  In any case, I'm glad we somehow managed to stop him. Thank you, umm...Mister...  
  
**First Hassan:**  Old Man of the Mountain. I am Hassan-i-Sabbah.  
  
**Da Vinci:**  {i}That{/i} Old Man of the Mountain!? What an intimidating aura!  
  
**Da Vinci:**  As expected of one who became a legend in life, you truly are in a different league!  
  
**Merlin:**  I'm in total agreement. It's really convincing coming from the legendary genius herself.  
  
**Merlin:**  As for our enemies in this domain...hmm, the Demon Beast Incarnadine and Shadow Servants!  
  
**Merlin:**  Just like the lineup from earlier.  
  
**Merlin:**  And the Heroic Spirits who will miraculously stand against them are───  
  
**Okada Izo:**  That'll be me!  
  
**Medusa:**  I'm here too. Not yet, Izou. Not quite yet.  
  
**Okada Izo:**  Rider, you think I'm a dog or something after all, is that it...?  
  
**Georgios:**  I am present as well!  
  
**Georgios:**  Much like Sir Molay, I too have come forth to rectify my sins in that Singularity!  
  
**Georgios:**  The Great Bewitching Queen who cants the Great Grail,  
  
**Georgios:**  in other words, the great evil spoken of in the Book of Revelation!  
  
**Georgios:**  In which case, thou art a dragon! I swear upon my Ascalon!  
  
**Georgios:**  I shall decapitate───one of those heads of yours!  
  
**Cursed Arm Hassan:**  We are present too! Unfit as we may be, we would like to offer our assistance───  
  
**First Hassan:**  Cursed Arm, hast thou redressed some of thy hesitations in life?  
  
**Cursed Arm Hassan:**  Lord Founder!?  
  
**Mata Hari:**  Is something the matter, Hassan? You're shouting all of a sudden.  
  
**Cursed Arm Hassan:**  N-n-n-n-n-no, I see.  
  
**Cursed Arm Hassan:**  Seeing how the world is on the brink of destruction,  
  
**Cursed Arm Hassan:**  the Lord Founder's advent does make sense!  
  
**Cursed Arm Hassan:**  How auspicious. What great fortune───I shall savor the joy of fighting alongside you!  
  
**First Hassan:**  Very well. Thou shalt endeavour as a Heroic Spirit.  
  
**First Hassan:**  Thou canst offer thy head after all is said and done with.  
  
**Cursed Arm Hassan:**  U-understood!  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  ────────  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  ───Vermin swarming all over the place.  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  Very well then. Bring it on. I shall exterminate you as an Apostle of Lust.  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  I have partaken of the overflowing Great Grail!  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  Know that I have reached heights unachievable by common Heroic Spirits!  
  
**Mash:**  Magical energy levels, rising! Such a tremendous amount!  
  
**Merlin:**  This much magical energy despite that incomplete Saint Graph, huh!?  
  
**Merlin:**  Looks like we have a tough enemy on our hands!  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  Ugh...! I...I...!  
  
**Mash:**  This voice is...!  
  
## Lost Jerusalem Part 2  
  
**Nitocris:**  Pay close attention! And now, behold!  
  
**Nitocris:**  For this is the advent of splendor! The splendor of Pharaoh Ozymandias!  
  
**Ozymandias:**  Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!  
  
**Ozymandias:**  Your supreme Pharaoh just happened to be passing by!  
  
**Ozymandias:**  And by complete coincidence, also passing by in the form of Amon-Ra!  
  
**Ozymandias:**  On a pleasure cruise, that is!  
  
**Ozymandias:**  But what is this? The knight who was in charge of guiding the pilgrims on their travels...  
  
**Ozymandias:**  That is only one shadow, and furthermore, only one Demon Beast Incarnadine.  
  
**Ozymandias:**  To be afraid of such minor pests is a complete farce!  
  
**Ozymandias:**  Have you forgotten when you opposed my majesty, wretch!?  
  
**Mash:**  Pharaoh Ozymandias! No, Amon-Ra!  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  ...!  
  
**Nitocris:**  Bask in the Pharaoh's splendor! How long shall you wallow in your dejection!?  
  
**Nitocris:**  If you can open your eyes, then stand and take up your sword.  
  
**Nitocris:**  He has allowed you especially to stand alongside his radiant majesty and do battle.  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  Your concern is well appreciated...  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  For mine is the shield of faith───my oaths, unshakable and unbreakable.  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  I believe, here and now, that it will never crack again! So swear we of the Knights Templar!  
  
**Merlin:**  Oh Hassan, do I hear a small chuckle from you?  
  
**Merlin:**  Have you come to empathize with your one-time nemesis?  
  
**First Hassan:**  It seems that not merely the tongue,  
  
**First Hassan:**  but the observation of the extradimensional Magus of Flowers is too quick to judge.  
  
**Merlin:**  Trying to tell me I'm misunderstanding things? Fair enough, I'll leave it there.  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  ──────Tsk.  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  Don't get cocky just from recruiting a pseudo-Demon God Pillar.  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  That thing falters in comparison to the Holy Grail...  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  I am secure in its power, in its inexhaustible magic energy!  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  I am...!  
  
**First Hassan:**  Hold thy tongue, lest it speak your last will.  
  
**First Hassan:**  If thou art a shadow, speak only the truth when nearing your death.  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  What's that...? My desires are no falsehood...!  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  I won't let you have your way. By my life and my regrets, you will be stopped here!  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  ───Say your prayers, my hideous shadow!  
  
## Lost Jerusalem Post-Battle and Babylon Part 1  
  
**Mash:**  ───Hostile Shadow Servant destroyed. The Demon Beast Incarnadine has been silenced!  
  
**Da Vinci:**  We did it! Good job, everybody!  
  
**Ozymandias:**  Victory should come as no surprise! Who else but I could have ascended to your aid?  
  
**Ozymandias:**  Hmph, but that Da Vinci girl's form is rather beautiful in itself.  
  
**Nitocris:**  Oh, Lord Ozymandias. You've returned to your normal Saint Graph?  
  
**Ozymandias:**  Do not be so formal, Nitocris. This is the proper form for a celebration and mopping-up.  
  
**Nitocris:**  Y-yes!  
  
**Cursed Arm Hassan:**  ───Lady Mash, Master of Chaldea, leave the rest to us.  
  
**Cursed Arm Hassan:**  Please go ahead while the gates of the domain are open!  
  
**Mata Hari:**  Don't give in before you reach the end. May fortune be with you!  
  
**Jacques de Molay:**  God's blessings on your path to conquest, Mash and Master of Chaldea!  
  
**Mash:**  Yes! Let's go, Master...!  
  
**Merlin:**  We have to be prepared for more than just Demon Beast Incarnadines in the next domain.  
  
**First Hassan:**  ───Let us conquer them all.  
  
**Mash:**  We have reached the seventh domain!  
  
**Tiamat:**  Mash...?  
  
**Tiamat:**  Mash. Mash! And Master too!  
  
**Tiamat:**  Mother is so happy to see her children again!  
  
**Tiamat:**  What good and darling children.  
  
**Mash:**  Y-yes...  
  
**Merlin:**  Suddenly, they're both like putty in her hands! Hmm, is this a bunrei of Divine Spirit Tiamat?  
  
**Lancelot:**  RRRRrrrrrRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrr!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  That's right, Tiamat! At least try to read the mood a little here!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  Breaking out the good mother moves in this tense atmosphere ain't hardly golden!  
  
**Tiamat:**  Are you sulking, Kintoki? Come over here.  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  It ain't a matter of sulking───  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  aw man, she's got more power to drag me away than Shuten ever had!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  Mmph.  
  
**Tiamat:**  There, there. You're a good boy, Kintoki.  
  
**Lancelot:**  RRRRrrrrrRRRRRrrrr!  
  
**Draco:**  Quite a few, indeed...  
  
**Draco:**  A few morsels, indeed. Do not underestimate a mere bunrei or shadow, Tiamat.  
  
**Draco:**  Very well. This once, I shall forgive you.  
  
**Draco:**  There is no King of Babylon here this time. No need to manipulate a king,  
  
**Draco:**  nor to devour any city of prosperity.  
  
**Draco:**  All who have shown their faces are Heroic Spirits guided here by some incomprehensible miracle.  
  
**Draco:**  How dull───  
  
**Draco:**  I share that sentiment as well.  
  
**Draco:**  Were I able to appear before my “foolish self” in the second domain,  
  
**Draco:**  I would tear off my uncle's head and play a game of catch with her...  
  
**Draco:**  But this is the domain entrusted to me. I never thought I would have to face all of you again.  
  
**Draco:**  But all is well. The Master of Chaldea has arrived at last.  
  
**Draco:**  The spare time and tedium ends now! I shall drink up every last one of you!  
  
**Tiamat:**  No, you won't! If you try to drink everything, Mother will be mad!  
  
**Tiamat:**  To protect Mash and Master, I will become a shield of dragon scales!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  Sounds good! Then I'll be the blade!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  And I'm gonna have to be an electric blade. I can hear the voices calling me.  
  
**Mash:**  Voices...?  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  Yeah, but obviously not any of yours. They're more faint and weak.  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  “There's too much bitterness to bear.”  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  That's what countless voices shouted the moment the world was burned.  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  I wonder how many things they would've wanted to do?  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  A mom making dinner, a kid who wanted to play the day after.  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  I've got no idea... It's enough to make me grind my teeth.  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  Whoever doesn't understand how important all those things are...  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  I don't know what's between the ears of them!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  Before you start talking about humanity's future, Draco,  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  I'm gonna smash your stupid nature back to normalcy!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  For every day that's gone to waste since this place was burned to ash,  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  I'm gonna kick your ass for everyone that couldn't make the most of them!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  I'm Kintoki, Sakata Kintoki. One of Raikou's Four Heavenly Kings who heard those sounds!  
  
**Lancelot:**  RRRRrrrRRRRRRRrr!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  Let's go, buddy! Restrain the demons and smash the rakshasas!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  Split the heaven and earth, tearing up space and Demon Beast Incarnadines with it!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  Hell yeah, now here's the treasured blade of fiery lightning coming to kill you dead!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  ───The one and only Golden Spark!  
  
**Draco:**  Very good. Shout and defy me!  
  
**Draco:**  Entertain me by changing the flavor of your dying moments with all you can muster,  
  
**Draco:**  human history!  
  
## Babylon Part 2  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  ───Some bewitching queen this Draco is!  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  A mere husk whose contents rest on the throne. Worthless.  
  
**Merlin:**  Wow. Could he be...?  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  It's you...!  
  
**Mash:**  King Nebuchadnezzar! N-no...!  
  
**Tiamat:**  Gilgamesh the 2.5th!  
  
**Tiamat:**  The aura seems different...it's changed? Maybe it's his hairstyle?  
  
**Tiamat:**  Maybe it's...the declaration to join us as an ally!?  
  
**Tiamat:**  Thank you. Mother is so glad.  
  
**Tiamat:**  I want to hug you tightly as thanks... Will you come here?  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  What is that form? Why has the Divine Spirit Tiamat shrunken so?  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  But first thing's first...  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  What did you say when you saw me?  
  
**Mash:**  U-uhm...  
  
**Lancelot:**  RrrrRRrr?  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  Right, right. Tiamat called him Gilgamesh the 2.5th.  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  (Mm...)  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  (She didn't get it wrong, did she? I know that Nebuchadnezzar was the 2.5th.)  
  
**Merlin:**  Huh? What?  
  
**First Hassan:**  Gilgamesh the 2.5th is what was said.  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  !  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  ...!  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  That. What is the meaning of Gilgamesh the 2.5th!?  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  Be quick, concise, and convincing in your explanation!  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  Now, the 2nd. That at least would be pleasant.  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  It's not as though that's beyond the realm of understanding.  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  But───what is this 2.5th to mean?  
  
**Tiamat:**  Huh.  
  
**Tiamat:**  Huh? What?  
  
**Tiamat:**  The familiar feeling of this Saint Graph,  
  
**Tiamat:**  its body and soul...you don't suppose this is...  
  
**Tiamat:**  The real one?  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  (So Tiamat did get it all wrong!?)  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  What is this reaction about, you mongrels!?  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  What is the meaning of calling me the real one!?  
  
**Enkidu:**  Hahahahaha. This is kind of amusing.  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  Not for me!  
  
**Enkidu:**  Gil, if you care so much, why don't you just use one of your Noble Phantasms?  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  Nonsense! To think I would use my Noble Phantasm of omniscience for such a trifle!?  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  What am I to say to Siduri in the underworld if I disgraced myself so───  
  
**Enkidu:**  Oh, were you planning to pass through the underworld on your way back?  
  
**Enkidu:**  Since when did you find fault with Siduri's lecturing?  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  Hmph...I have no objection to one that proves itself necessary.  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  And she has never volunteered advice out of turn.  
  
**Enkidu:**  Sure, whatever you say.  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  Enkidu!  
  
**Draco:**  ...  
  
**Draco:**  ──My, my. And now comes the last mouthful.  
  
**Draco:**  You act out a comedy before me, the Beast's retainer.  
  
**Draco:**  In mere seconds, you will find repentance in a pool of your own blood.  
  
**Draco:**  Cry out in agony and beg forgiveness.  
  
**Draco:**  Moan in despair and pray for salvation in death.  
  
**Draco:**  I deny all things. I shall devour your souls whole.  
  
**Draco:**  That which is sin stirs to form the finest wine.  
  
**Draco:**  Its tastes are terrors and agonies continuing without end.  
  
**Draco:**  How can the world of mere Heroic Spirits, mere imitations of Divine Spirits,  
  
**Draco:**  or even that of the King of Heroes even compare?  
  
**Draco:**  So long as you are human, you cannot stand against my reason.  
  
**Draco:**  You can but merely bow down.  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  Call me Gilgamesh the Sage-King, not the King of Heroes.  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  This is a Saint Graph well-suited for a mongrel of your ilk, Draco.  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  I shall quickly and brilliantly settle matters with you,  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  before addressing the issue of “Gilgamesh the 2.5th”.  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  Now come────I can taste without end the mud brought forth by prosperity.  
  
**Draco:**  You dare───  
  
## Babylon Post-Battle and Lilim Harlot Prologue  
  
**Mash:**  Confirmed annihilation of Bewitching Queen Draco's incomplete Saint Graph!  
  
**Tiamat:**  It's because she made mother furious! Hmph!  
  
**Tiamat:**  And an angry mother is strong. Tee-hee.  
  
**Enkidu:**  Fufu. How cute of you, mother.  
  
**Tiamat:**  Ahem!  
  
**Gilgamesh:**  Don't ahem me, dear sweet goddess Tiamat. I'm asking you what Gilgamesh 2.5 even means.  
  
**Tiamat:**  Ohh, what overbearing pressure...leave this to your mother and go on ahead!  
  
**Merlin:**  I think it's best if we actually take her advice. Look there!  
  
**Mash:**  Y-yes. The final gate at the end of the domain───it's opening up!  
  
**Tiamat:**  Do your best! Mother will be here praying for your safety!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**  This is the final great golden decisive showdown! Do me a solid and give it your best shot!  
  
**Lancelot:**  (RRRRRrrrrrRRRRRR)  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  Mash Kyrielight and her Master will now go beyond the final gate...!  
  
**Mash:**  And reach the throne!  
  
**Merlin:**  Well, the final battle is upon us. Are you ready?  
  
**First Hassan:**  ───  
  
**Merlin:**  It goes without saying, eh? We've gone beyond the gate now───  
  
**Mash:**  The magical energy quantity is immeasurable...it's First-Class Planetary Grade!  
  
**Merlin:**  The throne is in sight. I see, so the one seated there is the true Great Bewitching Queen.  
  
**Merlin:**  Deceiving “Chaldea” by mimicking the seven Singularities and linking many worlds together,  
  
**Merlin:**  and as nourishment for maturation,  
  
**Merlin:**  the wishes of the “saviors who brought salvation unto the world”───  
  
**Merlin:**  The Evil of Humanity who amassed the “wishes” of countless Chaldeas,  
  
**Merlin:**  each in parallel worlds, within the Grail and drank from it.  
  
**Merlin:**  Class Beast. The Sixth Beast.  
  
**Merlin:**  Or perhaps I should put it this way───Beast VI, the true form of Sodom's Beast.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  ...  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  Precisely. My Authority of the Beast is Nega-Messiah. I am the one who ridicules, slaughters and consumes the Savior.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  Cherishing the “wishes of the masses” is fine and all, but it provides no nourishment whatsoever.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  The Chaldea who vanquished the First Beast in this universe. And its Master. You who exist in a multitude of worlds.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  The only “wish” that will suffice in growing my horns is the wish to “save the world”.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  It is for this reason that the Singularities exist, that the Holy Grail War exists. Your “battles” were succulent indeed.  
  
**Mash:**  Then...the very act of competing for the Holy Grail results in Beast VI's growth...!?  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  Correct. As a result, you lot have reached this realm.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  The graveyard of many prosperities. A banquet table adorned by the rot of many Human Orders.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  This realm isn't just “the end of some history”. It prophesies the end of your human history.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  ───In other words, this is a fate written in stone that your world will reach in a few years from now.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  I am the one who savors that end. For fruits are best savored when they are on the verge of rotting.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  You have no cause to defy me, given that you have beheld the future. O Earthlings, perish before my fangs.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  You have my gratitude too. You did well “getting this far” once more.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  Chaldea may have raised me, but it is an inevitability of the Human Order to beckon the apocalypse.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  For Beasts are weak, and alone they cannot scar the world.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  Only you humans are capable of destroying the world.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  This repulsive scenery is what the masses desired.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  I am merely a Beast revelling in it. This outcome is one not even I can change.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  So hold your heads high. That desire has led to the completion of humanity's extermination here.  
  
**Mash:**  The desire of the masses... To find greater enjoyment. To live in greater comfort.  
  
**Mash:**  Born from this inclination of humanity's is the self-ruination that lies at the end of prosperity.  
  
**Mash:**  I understand that. It is an inevitability of life. So───that in itself is not evil.  
  
**Mash:**  I understand that it's not evil.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  ───Is that so? Then what is evil to you?  
  
**Mash:**  People's lives. Their feelings. Their memories. The ones who ridicule these are evil.  
  
**Mash:**  If this scenery lies at the end of the Human Order,  
  
**Mash:**  then we shall continue to move forward, seeking it.  
  
**Mash:**  However!  
  
**Mash:**  I will not accept you, you who treat those as mere amusements!  
  
**Mash:**  Beast VI! Beast of Calamity!  
  
**Mash:**  At a place elsewhere, at a Chaldea that is not our own,  
  
**Mash:**  “someone” fought until the very end! To not lose to them, this “Chaldea” here will defeat you!  
  
**Merlin:**  ───!  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  ──────!  
  
**Merlin:**  ───Wonderful. Oh, how wonderful, stargazing knight!  
  
**Merlin:**  That's right, I'm sick and tired of that inevitable end!  
  
**Merlin:**  After all, it takes a sourpuss to think the end can happen anytime so long as it's a happy ending!  
  
**Merlin:**  I happen to be rather greedy. Far greedier than any Master here in this Holy Grail War.  
  
**Merlin:**  I have no wish to see the end! I want to see a happiness that lasts forever and ever!  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  I see───So we are incompatible existences after all, Beast of the Planet.  
  
**Merlin:**  Woah there, don't say any more than that. I still haven't told a single soul about that yet.  
  
**Merlin:**  Well then, we both know where the other is coming from!  
  
**Merlin:**  It's time for us irreconciliable archenemies to settle our differences!  
  
**Merlin:**  Our enemy is Beast VI/S!  
  
**Merlin:**  The incarnation of decadency───  
  
**Merlin:**  that which continues to gaze upon the unsightliest of things───  
  
**Merlin:**  in the unsightliest of worlds!  
  
**First Hassan:**  The Evening Bell's moment draws near. Do not fall behind, child!  
  
**Mash:**  ───Roger that, Master. Commencing anti-Beast combat!  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  Hnn───  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  You remain unbroken in spite of this ugly showing. You continue to struggle in the face of such desolation.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  And that is fine. For this is how you ought to be.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  Though it may be a feat the other Beasts are incapable of achieving, the “Human Order Annihilation” is little more than the main dish.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  A delicacy it may be, but not one I haven't tasted multiple times before.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  I have long since grown tired of its taste. I have but one desire that brings me joy───  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  That swell of splendor blessed by the masses. In the midst of the filth of greed that envelops the heavens,  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  a pitiful gem continues to shine regardless. To grasp it within my fingers.  
  
**Noah:**  I swear, you and Draco are cut from the same cloth.  
  
**Noah:**  Well, I suppose it's to be expected, since we're talking about the real thing and its aspect.  
  
**Noah:**  However───it's precisely because you continue to lounge around like that!  
  
**Noah:**  That you snatch defeat from the jaws of victory like this!  
  
**Noah:**  Of course! Who else but me would appear gallantly as a comrade in this place and time!  
  
**Noah:**  Chieftain of the survivors of the Great Flood, heir to the eldest survivor Utnapishtim!  
  
**Noah:**  The fair youth of salvation, Noah!  
  
**Noah:**  I have traversed the sea of blood, alongside the radiance of Zohar!  
  
**Noah:**  That said, I'm not much of a fighter.  
  
**Noah:**  In exchange, I've brought a special helping hand along for a ride!  
  
**Merlin:**  Here it comes! You did it! Now that's what I'm talking about!  
  
**Arthur:**  Merlin...  
  
**Arthur:**  There's a lot I'd like to ask you, Merlin.  
  
**Arthur:**  Why are you here in this world? Why did you send me to that distant world all alone?  
  
**Arthur:**  But I shall refrain for now. I've been informed of everything by Rider, Noah!  
  
**Mash:**  You're───  
  
**Arthur:**  It would seem I've barely made it in time.  
  
**Arthur:**  Pleased to make your acquaintance, Chaldean Master of this world.  
  
**Arthur:**  And Mash Kyrielight of this world! I am───  
  
**Arthur:**  I am one who hunts the Beast. The wanderer on a journey across the many worlds.  
  
**Arthur:**  ───My True Name is Arthur Pendragon!  
  
**Mash:**  Arthur Pendragon! The King of Knights sung of in Britain's legends, the Red Dragon!  
  
**Arthur:**  When L and R are both present, so too will S and G manifest under either sky...  
  
**Arthur:**  Everything is in accordance with Merlin's prophecy.  
  
**Arthur:**  I have traversed many a world for this moment.  
  
**Arthur:**  Know that the Holy Sword of the Planet will not let you escape───even if we are worlds apart.  
  
**Arthur:**  That avarice! That pride!  
  
**Arthur:**  I shall close the curtains on them on this very day, at this very moment, at this very place!  
  
**Arthur:**  ───Beast VI, Sodom's Beast!  
  
## Lilim Harlot Main  
  
**First Hassan:**  ──────  
  
**First Hassan:**  O beast of depravity. O dragon who partakes of filth from the golden grail.  
  
**First Hassan:**  The sound of that bell───  
  
**First Hassan:**  Nay. The radiance of that star.  
  
**First Hassan:**  Have you witnessed it once more? With those gleaming childlike eyes of yours.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  ───To think you would address me in that manner. You haven't changed, old man.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  Oh, I see it well enough... Radiant even in the midst of this foulness.  
  
**First Hassan:**  ───That will do. O Knight of the Holy Sword, tis thy turn.  
  
**Arthur:**  Yes!  
  
**Arthur:**  ───<ruby>Thirteenth seal, release<rt>Seal Thirteen</rt></ruby>! ───<ruby>Round Table decision, start<rt>Decision Start</rt></ruby>!  
  
**Merlin:**  Two Grand Heroic Spirits plus the Knight of the Holy Sword,  
  
**Merlin:**  a Beast slayer who traverses the worlds.  
  
**Merlin:**  The end is in sight. The Chaldea that you have preyed upon so many times now,  
  
**Merlin:**  will bare their fangs at you right at the very end! Go on, grumble and protest!  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  ───Hmph. What a loathsome succubus you are.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  Mash Kyrielight. O stargazing knight.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  You claimed you would not avert your eyes from this future. That you would only fight against the evil that I am.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  I hereby ask of that pitifully innocent heart of yours.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  You said yourself that everything has an end.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  That much is true. However───  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  When all of creation disappears, who will be there to witness that end?  
  
**Mash:**  ...that is...  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  Yes. That is the epitome of sorrow. The epitome of anguish.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  I am the Evil that was born to deliver that sorrow.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  The Human Order, human history.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  You lot speak of it as though it were something of great importance.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  There is truth to those claims.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  After all, it has the strength to resist me right up to the very end like this.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  Since I possess magical energy of the First-Class Planetary Grade,  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  I am already an existence far above the likes of you.  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  Then...it is none other than I,  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  who feasted upon the most prosperous city that reached the extremity of civilization,  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  who can lusciously savor it more than anyone else, down to the very last drop, no?  
  
**Mash:**  T-then, you're...  
  
**Mash:**  Out of curiosity───  
  
**Mash:**  The world───  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  What an inelegant way of phrasing it. Here's how you put it into words beautifully:  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  Desire!!  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  My greed and avarice! That is to say, I wish to “savor and consume more”!  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  Behold an Evil of Humanity,  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  the driving force behind the development of civilizations and their downfall!  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  Rejoice, children of Chaldea!  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  The world shall disappear now at the hands of my dearly insatiable gluttony!  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  And at the very end, in a barren, lifeless void, I shall proclaim thus:  
  
**Sodom's Beast:**  ───“What a wonderful meal.”  
  
**Mash:**  !!  
  
**Mash:**  Right... Right, Master! We have to stop her!  
  
**Mash:**  Right here! Right now!  
  
## Lilim Harlot Post-Battle and Epilogue  
  
**Mash:**  We...we did it...  
  
**Mash:**  We did it, Senpai! Yes, yes! We...!  
  
**Mash:**  ...vanquished Beast VI/S...!  
  
**Mash:**  Last Order, completed! As of this moment, the Grand Order has concluded!  
  
**Merlin:**  Mash! Master!  
  
**Merlin:**  You did great, well and truly!  
  
**Merlin:**  I never even imagined that you would triumph without a single casualty.  
  
**Merlin:**  I thought we'd lose one of you, like we did against the First Beast.  
  
**Merlin:**  But it would seem my fears were unfounded.  
  
**Merlin:**  That's a relief. After all, there is no Cath Palug in this world───  
  
**Mash:**  ...?  
  
**Merlin:**  It's complicated, and you're better off not knowing about it anyway.  
  
**Merlin:**  You'll soon be forgetting what you heard just now. I'm sorry. And thank you.  
  
**Merlin:**  Let's celebrate, for starters! Thanks to your efforts, the Human Order of this world is saved!  
  
**First Hassan:**  Hmm. The annihilation of the Human Order may have been averted, however...  
  
**Merlin:**  However?  
  
**First Hassan:**  Gaze upon what lies behind you.  
  
**Merlin:**  Heh, you're not going to scare me that easily───Oh.  
  
**Merlin:**  H-hey there, if it isn't my beloved Arthur! You're acting all tense, what's gotten into you?  
  
**Arthur:**  That's not the problem here! You've been playing up the recluse angle, Merlin!  
  
**Arthur:**  But if you can come out just like that,  
  
**Arthur:**  then there's no reason for me to continue wandering the worlds alone───  
  
**Merlin:**  A-www! You're putting me on the spot here!  
  
**Merlin:**  I was watching Mash and Master's journey,  
  
**Merlin:**  and while it may have been a harsh one it seemed fun nonetheless,  
  
**Merlin:**  and that's how it is!  
  
**Arthur:**  Because it seemed fun!?  
  
**Arthur:**  Ok...listen up Merlin. You know,  
  
**Arthur:**  I've been travelling the worlds in accordance with your prophecy,  
  
**Arthur:**  searching for L and R at that Chaldea from far away───  
  
**Arthur:**  There I kept awaiting the continuation of the prophecy, for portents of S and G. And yet...  
  
**Arthur:**  You intervened, an intervention unprophesied and unplanned. Just because it seemed fun!?  
  
**Merlin:**  Waahh, save me, Noah!  
  
**Noah:**  No, you reap what you sow. Go break a leg!  
  
**Merlin:**  Ugh~!  
  
**Mash:**  Incoming message from Chaldea───it says that our retrieval process is underway!  
  
**Mash:**  Yes... Well, unfortunate as it may be, this is where we bid you farewell.  
  
**First Hassan:**  Fear not, for fate already binds us.  
  
**Noah:**  This need not necessarily be the final farewell.  
  
**Noah:**  The same applies for those Heroic Spirits you have encountered in the Singularities thus far.  
  
**Noah:**  We'll meet again someday! When the time comes!  
  
**Mash:**  Yes...  
  
**Merlin:**  Head home now, both of you. Hold your heads high.  
  
**Merlin:**  After all, this is your momentous triumphant return!  
  
**Merlin:**  Oh, that's right───I have one piece of good news for you.  
  
**Merlin:**  The condition outside the Chaldea base appears to be in a once-in-a-year state right now.  
  
**Merlin:**  That is to say, the blizzard has subsided! You really shouldn't miss this chance!  
  
**Mash:**  Then───is the sky really...?  
  
**Merlin:**  A special, blue sky.  
  
**Mash:**  From our era, our Earth───  
  
**Mash:**  Yes... Yes! Master!  
  
**Mash:**  Let's go see that blue sky of ours!
