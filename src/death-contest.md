An era where every part of human life is technology. 

Y2K38 
Year 2038 problem (See [Year 2038 problem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem) more more info regarding this)

Global Technology Failure, The darkest day of Humanity 
GTF killed over 20% of Human Population 
Sure it was fixed later but damage was already done. 
This became the catalyst for the series of events which lead to World War III. 

Greed, Envy and Wrath 
During this Darkest Days 
Greed: People’s greed to get everything, not saving anything for others.

Envy : People jealousy over others, “Why didn’t they suffered”

Wrath : Anger towards others for many reasons.

From 2038 to 2045 , This period of time was called Before The Third World War or B3WW for short 

---

During The 2040 AD, 
There used to be a farmer who had a happy family 
Him , his wife and his two child 
One Son and One Daughter 

[The Son’s POV]
That day, Group of people came. They said they are from The Government. 
I don’t know what convo happened but whatever happened, but it resulted in my parents dying. 

And My Sister being taken by them 
I later learned that she was sold as a slave.  

—--

I quickly enlist in the Military, It was hard to do but I have to do it after all. War is the only way I could find The government responsible for killing my parents. 

I even make a girlfriend, but there a thought inside me 
Screaming at myself for making a gf.

Years passed , i become an high enough Ranked 
The WW3 Started 
On my first few missions 
I make my name 

I became a “Hero”.
I hate calling myself hero though, 
Its 2046 
During a medal ceremony. 
I saw him, that man who killed my parent. 
Him 
He was giving us Medal 
Him 
Him 
Him 
My brain stopped having any sane thought. 
The moment he came near me.I took out my gun and shot him in the forehead.

Bang 
This was such a satisfying sound, the beauty of his dead face. 
Ha ha ha 

Soon this death created a scream across the hall. 
Soon others took their guns.
 Asking me to surrender, 
But that's the last thing I will do. 

I use his body as a meat shield, Trying to escape , killing everybody who comes in my way. I even kill my former friends, People who I came to make memories with. 

I escaped
  
This incident was broadcast all across the nation.   
  
Soon while I was seated at my usual place, a secret location that me and my girlfriend knew.  
And The person who came here was my Girlfriend,   
Asking me what's happening   
Why I decided to kill them   
  
I answered her everything   
The incident 6 years before and my sole reason for existing.   
  
__The Conversation__  
“They all deserve it, Those Corrupt Pigs”  
“You should have told me everything”  
“And then what, What you knowing about me will change anything”  
She was in tears, I couldn't understand. Maybe i could have understood before i killed him but My heart has already been consumed by flames  
“And Stop following me”  
I shoot her at the legs   
“And it's for better to stop being my friend, We are now strangers.”  
==The Girlfriend pov==  
I experience fear, Seeing him now   
From being a symbol of hope to me to now being Fear itself.  
  
Others found me , but he already left.   
I have one regret that I was unable to tell him about the child.  
  
–  
He came to be known as Grim Reaper  
Soon he make his name , as an One Man Army   
Defeating everybody   
Killing The Government officials all across the globe.  
  
===The Grim Reaper===   
Grim Reaper   
Perhaps the best name for me,   
I am known to world as Grim Reaper   
I killed everybody who opposed me.   
My heart still burns with Hatred and Flame.   
This revenge will consume me,   
  
But I don’t care.   
Few people become my follower,   
And I gladly used my followers for my goals.   
  
Soon 8 years passed and its 2054 AD now   
The World is in dire state.   
  
One of my follower inform me about a location he came to find where a government official will come,   
Another person who killed my family.   
  
I got to that location but it was a Trap, my follower sold me but i couldn't care less and I shot him.  
  
And I didn't feel any emotions.   
  
A Trap setup by 4-5 countries together to kill me.   
An fight that last 46 hours   
  
I don’t know how many i kill in this battle field   
But I was also severely injured.  
  
I might die here before killing him   
I don’t want it , I WANT TO GET PLEASURE OF KILLING THAT PIG   
Soon he came out to the wild, I ran   
I ran toward him   
The more i ran, the more i was shot down but i still ran   
And Use my Bullet to kill him   
  
And then I remember about her, My sister   
I didn’t even thought about her until that day 12 years ago and an emotion that is coming to me that i even forgot i had  
“I am such a bad brother”   
Forgetting about his sister, I wonder where she is now.   
But well i am dying and a Dead man have no feelings  
  
But if i have a wish   
Then I wish for my Girlfriend and my sister to be happy.  
  
## Fuji - Ado Edem Death   
  
A branch sprouted and pierced into the knight's flesh.  
  
His body was hopelessly attempting to repair itself, Slash Emperor, which had cleaved the false moon was changing him as it always did. Grain slowly dissipated around him.   
  
Heaven's Corpse will soon disperse its leaves - and everyone will die. But if he could just rise up to the core of the world trees then --  
  
The illusion of a tired girl appeared before him.  
  
"Is it really okay for you to do this?"  
  
The knight didn't speak.  
  
It was always like this for him.  
Ever since he birthed a sword that was considered worthy, Knight Edem was a valuable tool for humanity to use rather than a person to be respected.   
  
"Please just go away. This is my old body, I can keep it under control for as long as I can."  
  
He can't do that. Besides, he wasn't even sure his plan would work. Slash Emperor does not grow in soil like a normal plant.  
  
The girl got angry, "I knew someone just like you. Please just run away! It's not worth throwing your life away over nothing."  
  
He could make some guesses based on combat reports. But he was struggling to understand why she cared so much.    
  
"Was it the one who killed you?"  
  
The angel's eyes widened for a second, and then she looked as if she were about to burst into tears.  
  
"Well, yes, he did... But he was really nice to me! He let me play guitar, he let me cook and clean, and bought me lots of nice food! But then he said something silly and never came back."  
  
"He wanted to help people, probably because someone helped him. You're right. I am the same. I can become the core of Heaven's Corpse and give my life to save the entire Human Species, I'll gladly do it."  
  
His black armor was obscured by the white roots covering his whole arm and chest.  
"It doesn't look like I have much of a choice anyway."  
  
"But I don't want anyone else to die, I love everyone in this world."  
  
The machine laughed for the first time in his life, "You really are an idiot. This isn't the end, I'm sure Gun God would have said the same thing."  
  
He smiled as he wiped the fake angel's tears with his remaining human hand.  
  
"We'll keep loving the people who survived, together.", making contact with the core.  
  
"Alright!" V/V smiled, with tears running down her face.  
  
Returning to the ruined streets of the city, a one-winged A-Ray noticed on top of the hill that Godot would often visit  
  
***-- despite the grey clouds, there was a small tree growing from the withered grass.***

## Mercu - Side Story A  
  
—Sakuragawa, we have a body at the Rennes Building, go there ASAP.

My superior opened the door to Forensics while giving an order. His direct order was a clear sign that he was uncharacteristically nervous, betraying his usual calm demeanor, which meant that this case was different than usual.

I stood up from my desk and started packing up my equipment.

—What are the details, Sergeant Mito?

—You will see once you get there– He started replying, when suddenly his phone began to ring– Sorry, I’m a bit busy right now, I’ll be expecting your report.

Mito picked up the call and walked away from Forensics without giving me time to react. Having finished our short exchange, I finished packing my things and exited the station to get into my car to go to the Rennes Building.

The Rennes Building is a large corporate building housing the headquarters of the Japanese branch of the Rennes Corporation, a large international company of French origin which produces and distributes tobacco and different types of cigarettes. During the last three years this branch had grown in profits quite a bit, and it was said that the founder of the company, Jacques Pierre Rennes, would host an event inside that building in a few days to congratulate the branch.

—(This may be the reason why Sergeant Mito was so nervous, maybe it involves one of the big shots at the company…) –I thought while driving.

Once I reached my destination, despite being so early in the morning, I was greeted by a large group of bystanders and reporters surrounding the building, with some police officers preventing them from getting close to it. I made my way past them and showed my identification to one of the officers, who let me pass through.

—Where is it? –I asked, trying to lower my voice to not alert the public.

—It’s inside the building, in the entrance hall.

Putting on my gloves, I walked towards the front door and made my way inside the enormous building.

The hall was large and spacious, with stairs at both sides and a row of elevators behind. It was filled to the brim with works of art, from paintings to sculptures of all kinds, and a large red sign saying “CONGRATULATIONS!” was hung above. Both it and most of the paintings were suspended with steel wires, probably with hooks at the tips which remained obscured behind what they were holding.

—(I guess today was meant to be the big day, huh…)

Leaving the open door behind me, I started to enter deeper into the hall. I was greeted by a reception desk with two empty chairs, next to which stood an officer, talking to a man. The latter was severely older than the officer and, judging by his uniform, he must have been one of the building’s janitors. I approached them.

—Sakuragawa, from Forensics. What is the situation?

The janitor stood looking at the floor, silent, while the officer turned towards me. He was a young man in his 30s with short dark hair and an amicable face. Despite being slightly older than me, his uniform showed that his status on the hierarchy was quite low.

—My name is Joba Kawachi, from the nearby police box. –He replied politely– I was the first one to arrive at the scene and call for backup. This man right here discovered the body half an hour ago, and immediately called the police.

—Thank you, officer Kawachi. Could you lead me to the body? I have to examine the scene.

—Of course, it’s further inside the hall –He started walking, but not before directing his attention to the janitor and speaking to him in a calm voice. Sir, you should stay here and don’t move, okay?

—Yes, officer…

The old janitor replied with a low voice and a defeated expression, still under the influence of what he had previously set his eyes on. It would take a long time for him to forget about this, if ever. Not just anyone can stand being close to a corpse, let alone examining it, which was what my job was for.

—By the way, the janitor was not the first person to find the body. He also found another man, a foreigner, unconscious close to it. An ambulance picked him up shortly before you arrived.

While following Kawachi down the hall, I started looking at the different works of art spread around the room, when I noticed a particular chalice sitting on top of a pedestal in the center of the entrance hall. It was seemingly carved on white rock, and featured Egyptian motifs on its surface. Noticing my curiosity, Kawachi started giving an explanation.

—I heard the founder of the company brought some artifacts from his personal collection here. That chalice must be a replica, because I remember seeing a very similar one on a documentary a while ago.

—A friend of mine would love seeing this under different circumstances, he’s a bit of a history fan.

As we finished our little exchange, we continued walking towards the end of the hall. From my position I could see a large statue, as well as the cables supporting the final painting hung at the end of the room. Once we passed the statue, I slowed my pace.

It was there.

Suspended from the cables was not a painting, but the bloated and mangled remains of a man. His arms had been twisted several times in an unnatural position behind his back, with the hooks which were meant to support a painting piercing his wrists. The skin on shoulders and forearms had been ruptured, hanging tattered as macabre feathers. All of his body seemed to have been inflated, leaving him almost unrecognisable as a man were it not for his still visible beard, which appeared to have once been blond, now tainted of the red oozing from all his orifices, including his eye sockets, empty voids without eyes, which dripped on a pool of blood under him.

I readied my camera and made a signal to Kawachi so he would stay back while I took wide shots of the scene. Now I understood why sergeant Mito was so worried about back at the station.

—Messed up, right? I don’t know who possibly could have done something like this. If you don’t mind, I’ll stay away from it, gives me the creeps.

—Don’t worry, I’ll take it from here –I said, trying to calm him down and, in a way, myself too.

Camera still in hand, I got closer to the body to take pictures of smaller details, when I noticed an object on the floor, right next to the pool of blood. It was a wallet, stained in red. I quickly marked its location and took a picture of its original position, after which I picked it up and opened it to see the ID.

—(Salvador Pallars... Another foreigner. Judging by the beard and hair colour, it must be the victim’s wallet which fell off at some point. The blood on it seems to not have dried long ago.)

While I was storing the wallet as evidence, my phone vibrated. It was a message from my superior, telling me an Investigator would be there in ten minutes. I sent a quick reply, my mind completely focused on analysing the scene.

Behind the body was a painting, supporting itself next to the back wall. It must have been what was supposed to be hanging from those cables, but a large stain of blood hid what it might have depicted. Most likely it was from the victim, but just in case I took a picture of the painting before taking a sample of the blood to have it analysed back at the lab.

With nothing else surrounding the body, I moved my attention to it. Being careful to not damage it, I started taking pictures of its different injuries from up close, starting from the bottom and moving upwards. His left hand had a red tattoo of abstract shape, which stood out from the rest of his skin which, while damaged, did not show any sort of decorative markings. Taking a closer look at his hands also made me realise that it wasn’t just his orifices that were bleeding, but also the tips of his fingers, right under the nails, which dripped down as the body swayed slightly– Wait, bleeding and swaying?

I suddenly had a dreadful realisation, and quickly moved my fingers to the mass that used to be his neck… And I sensed something. It was extremely faint, but I was able to pick up on a pulse. Rapidly, I looked behind me in the direction Kawachi was standing.

—Call an ambulance, fast! He’s still alive!

…

…

…

The ambulance arrived shortly after. With a lot of care, the paramedics unhooked the man and took him away. I tried looking for fingerprints on the statue or the painting, but none were found on the former and only one type in the latter. The janitor told me that yesterday the building had been closed, and he and the rest of the crew had cleaned up the whole building to prepare for the celebration today. However, I managed to get some fingerprints from the front door. They were from the victim, the unconscious man, the janitor, officer Kawachi and a pair of unidentified ones.

I heard he died on his way to the hospital. Strangely, the hand tattoo was nowhere to be found when his corpse was examined. Despite my report and the subsequent investigation, we never found out what happened to him.  
  
## Aareez - Always With You  



She’d always thought their lives would go out in a hurricane, a fire. In fury. Something wild, something like the unbelievable experiences he loved talking about so much, straight out of the books she loved reading so much.

But there was no fire here. No storm. Only the sterile, suffocating quiet of the hospital room. Only the steady, artificial beeping of the monitors. Only the shallow rise and fall of his chest, too slow, too fragile.

It was raining again.

Not the kind of stormy downpour that rattled windows and soaked the earth in thunder. No, this rain was softer - gentler. A whisper of grief, like the sky itself was mourning. The clouds outside cast a dim, blue-gray light through the hospital window, and everything inside felt... muted. Still. Like the world was holding its breath.

Al was dying.

And for all the years he spent defying impossible odds, surviving experiences no one else could dream of - he couldn’t outrun this. Not this time. It wasn’t some wilderness he could fight his way out of, wasn’t a wound he could tape over or a challenge he could overcome with sheer will.

It was sickness. Something silent and creeping, that stole pieces of him day by day, for months now.

And now, all that remained was this room. These last few breaths. This final goodbye.

Elia sat beside the bed, her hand wrapped tightly around his. She hadn’t let go in hours. Her fingers trembled with every heartbeat.

"Al..." she whispered, voice breaking, "Please. Just hold on a little longer. Just a little longer, okay? They - they’re working on a new treatment, they said it might-"

“Elly,” Alius said, and even though his voice was barely audible, it still carried that warmth. That same steady gentleness she’d fallen in love with all those years ago. “Hey… it’s okay.”

It wasn’t.
Nothing about this was okay.

His skin was pale, drawn tight over fragile bones. The fever had stripped the color from his cheeks, and the spark in his eyes - his fire, his unshakable light - had dimmed to embers. Every breath came with effort now, shallow and raspy, as though even the air didn’t want to burden him.

He squeezed her hand weakly, as if to say *I’m still here.*

But for how long?

“I wanted more time,” she said, biting back a sob, “We - we were supposed to grow old together. We *deserved* forever. I thought we had forever.”

Al smiled - How could he still smile? - faintly. “We did. In our own way.”

Tears fell freely down her cheeks. “That’s not fair. That’s not enough.”

Outside the room, his mother sat in the dimly lit hallway, hands clasped tightly in her lap. She barely moved, barely breathed. The years had touched her gently, but grief - grief had worn her down like the tide against stone, relentless and unyielding. She had lost her husband years ago, had learned to live with that hollow ache. But this… this was different. She was about to lose her son.

Her baby boy. 

Beside her, Naim, Alius’s best friend, leaned forward, elbows on his knees, fingers laced together. His shoulders were hunched in a way that made him look older than he was. Ide sat silently across from them, staring at the ground, refusing to cry - because if she started, she might never stop.

And further down the hall, Alius’ sister Adera kept watch over a ten year old girl with bright chestnut brown hair like her mother and wide, tear-filled brown eyes like her father.

Sellia had begged to go in. Pleaded. Screamed.

But Elia couldn’t bear it. No one could.

They couldn’t let her see her father like this.

Not when her last memory could still be him smiling, albeit weakly, holding his head up high, laughing like the world, *their world* , wasn’t falling apart.

Back in the room, Elia pressed her forehead against the edge of the bed.

“I can’t do this without you.”

“You won’t have to,” Alius whispered, and Elia could hear the lie in his voice, could feel the tremble in his hand beneath hers. “You’re stronger than you think. You always have been.”

“Don’t say goodbye,” she said, squeezing his hand so tightly her knuckles went white. “Please don’t say goodbye.”

“I’m not,” he murmured. “I’m just saying… thank you.”

“For what?”

“For loving me. For giving me Sellia. For making me believe in forever.”

A sob tore through her chest. “You promised me a lifetime.”

She was being selfish. Disgusting. She couldn’t find it in herself to care.

“I gave you everything I had,” he said, and his eyes fluttered closed for a moment - just a moment - but her heart seized all the same.

She shook him gently. “Al. Al - stay with me, okay? Please - just stay.”

He opened his eyes again, barely. His voice was more strained. “I’m tired, Elly…”

“I know,” she whispered, brushing the damp hair from his forehead, “I know, but just a little longer. Please. Just a little.”

His breathing grew shallower.

Each second was a countdown now.

Elia’s whole world was collapsing in on itself - because Al wasn’t just her husband, or the father of her child. He was her beginning. Her always. Her every heartbeat.

And he was slipping away.

“I wanted to stay till I see Sellia’s future,” Alius said weakly. A tear rolled down his pale skin as he let out a gasp. “Wanted to walk her down the aisle someday…”

“She still needs you,” Elia whispered, choking on her grief. “*I* still need you.”

“I know,” he said. “And I’ll still be there. I promise. I’ll be there in every sunset, every storm, every memory. You’ll feel me when she laughs like I used to.”

“No-” Elia cried. “That’s not enough! I want you. *I want you here.* ”

His smile remained, but a soft frown emerged on his brow. She fought the urge to smooth it out, to kiss him until all he knew was her lips on him.

“Elly… can I… ask you something?”

Elia breathed. “Anything.”

Alius, for the first time that day, moved to sit up. Elia jumped to keep him down, wincing at his soft groans of pain, kissing along his hair in apology. He compromised by staring her in the eye.

“Promise me,” he murmured. “You’ll be okay. Please promise me you’ll-” a cough. “You’ll take care of Sellia? You won’t give up?”

Elia’s eyes burnt as she lowered her head to his hand. She hated this. She wanted it all to end. “Al…”

“Please?” he whimpered, his voice breaking, and she thought that maybe she broke with it, if only she had any sense of what being whole felt like. She had lost that feeling since yesterday morning, when he took a turn for the worst.

She looked up at her husband. Her everything, staring right back at her with tears glimmering in his eyes, and she knew there was only one possible answer.

“I’ll never give up,” she kissed his hand. “Not until it’s over, right?”

He smiled back, content, but there was something wrong with it and Elia couldn’t place what until-

Oh.

He was fading. She could feel it.

“I love you,” he breathed. 

“I love you more,” she said, tears soaking the sheets beneath her.

His lips curved faintly. “Not possible…”

She leaned up to kiss his forehead, then his cheek, then his lips. “Please don’t leave me.”

“I wish I could stay.”

He looked past her then, his gaze distant - far away. And she knew.

“No. No no no no - Al, *look at me.* Please. Don’t go. *Don’t go.* ”

But his eyes were glassy now. His chest barely rose.

And then silence.

The monitors began to scream, but Elia didn’t hear them. Didn’t feel the doctors as they pushed in around her. Didn’t move when they pulled her back, tried to revive him, shouted orders, tried *everything.*
But it was too late.

He was gone.

She dropped to her knees.

And the scream that left her throat was one the world would never forget. 

---

They let her hold him after.

Once the monitors fell silent, once the chaos faded into quiet murmurs and drawn faces and shaking heads, they let her crawl back to his bedside and cradle him in her arms. He was still warm.

That made it worse.

It made her feel like if she just wished hard enough, screamed loud enough, maybe - *maybe* - his heart would start again. That it wasn’t over. That there was still time.

But there wasn’t.

Time had run out.

And all Elia could do was hold the love of her life and sob into his hospital gown like a woman who had just lost the air in her lungs, the sky above her, the earth beneath her feet. Because she had.

"Al… please," she whispered, her tears soaking into his skin. "Please… wake up. Just one more minute. Just one more 'I love you.' *Please.*"

The world stayed quiet around her. 

She stayed like that for what felt like an eternity. Until she heard a soft knock. A quiet voice.

“Elia?”

His mother’s eyes were red, and her arms trembled as she stepped into the room. She looked at Alius - her son - then at Elia, and her breath hitched.

“I didn’t get to say goodbye,” she whispered, as her knees buckled and Elia caught her before she hit the ground.

They clung to each other, these two women who had loved him more than life, and sobbed into each other’s shoulders. Elia felt her mother-in-law’s hand clutch the fabric of her shirt, felt her whisper Alius’s name over and over like a prayer - like if she kept saying it, he’d answer.

But he didn’t.

He never would again.

They told Sellia the next morning.

---

Elia had sent her with Adera, trusting her to take Sellia home as the night stretched on. She barely registered the moment they left. Everything was a blur, her body moving on instinct as she filled out paperwork, her signature shaky but legible. Discussions of payments, logistics - things that should have mattered - felt distant, meaningless.

Around her, voices murmured condolences, hushed whispers of *“I’m so sorry for your loss,”* and *“He was so young…”* But the words slid off her, weightless, empty. What did apologies matter when he was gone?

She arrived home early that morning, exhaustion clinging to her like a second skin. The night had been spent ensuring his mother wouldn’t be alone - Naim had promised to stay with her, to make sure she ate, to keep her from collapsing under the weight of her grief. It was the least Elia could do.

But now, as she stepped through the door, none of that mattered. Only one thought consumed her. *Sellia.*

She moved on autopilot, silent as a shadow as she made her way to her daughter’s room. When she opened the door, the dim light of dawn cast soft golden streaks across the bed, illuminating the scene before her.

Adera was curled protectively around her, her arms wrapped around the girl’s waist, holding her close even in sleep.

The sight nearly broke Elia all over again.

She swallowed, stepping inside, the floor creaking beneath her. She knelt beside the bed, reaching out to touch Adera’s shoulder. The younger girl stirred, blinking blearily before her gaze locked onto Elia’s.

For a moment, neither of them spoke. Then, Adera’s face crumpled, eyes glistening. Still, she tried to smile.

“Hi, Elia,” she whispered, her voice thick with unshed tears. “How are you feeling?”

Elia couldn’t answer. Her throat was too tight, her emotions too raw. Instead, she cupped Adera’s face gently, pressing a soft kiss to her forehead. Adera let out a trembling sob at the gesture, her hands gripping Elia’s sleeves for just a second before she pulled away.

Elia turned toward the bed, her gaze settling on her daughter’s sleeping form. Sellia was small, too small, curled into herself like she could keep the world out if she just held tight enough.

Elia forced herself to speak. “Can I sit with her? Alone?”

Adera wiped at her tears, nodding. “I’ll be in the living room,” she whispered. “Please… call me if you need anything.”

“I got it.” Elia squeezed her hand. “Thank you.”

And then she was alone.

Carefully, she eased herself onto the bed, her weight sinking into the mattress as she inched closer to her daughter. The silence stretched, thick and heavy, filled with the unspoken things she didn’t know how to say.

She barely had time to settle before Sellia jolted awake.

The girl shot up like a coiled spring, fists clutching the blankets so tightly her knuckles turned white. Her breath was ragged, uneven, like she’d been fighting off the truth even in sleep.

“Mom?” Sellia’s voice was hoarse, the remnants of dried tears rough in her throat. Elia’s heart cracked at the realization - she had cried herself to sleep.

Elia swallowed down the lump in her throat and opened her arms. “Hi, baby.”

Sellia fell into her embrace immediately, small and trembling, clinging to her like she was the only thing keeping her tethered to this world.

Then, the question came.

“Where’s Dad?”

Elia froze.

The breath left her lungs in a sharp, broken gasp. She lifted a trembling hand, brushing Sellia’s hair from her face as gently as she could, willing herself to find the words - *the right words .*

But nothing came.

Her mouth opened, but only a fractured sound escaped - a breath, a sob, something broken beyond repair.

It was enough - Sellia understood.

Her little face crumpled, her eyes wide with disbelief, with horror, with the kind of pain a child should never have to endure.

“No.”

Elia shook her head, and the moment she did, Sellia screamed.

A raw, piercing sound, filled with more devastation than her body should have been able to contain.

“No! No, no, no - he promised me! He *promised* me!”

She thrashed in Elia’s arms, wrenching herself away, pounding her small fists against her mother’s chest, desperate, furious, inconsolable.

“He *said* he’d always come home! He *said* he’d never leave!” Her cries turned ragged, her fists losing strength, her rage collapsing into agony. “He promised…”

Elia couldn’t speak.

She just wrapped her arms around her daughter, holding her together as she came apart. She pressed frantic, desperate kisses into her hair, rocking her back and forth, whispering nothing but *I’m here, I’ve got you, I love you* , over and over, like the words could somehow make up for the one person who wasn’t here to say them.

Sellia clutched at Elia’s shirt, gasping between sobs. “I want to see him,” she whimpered. “Please. I *need* to see him.”

Elia squeezed her eyes shut, pressing her lips to the top of her daughter’s head, trying - failing - to steady her voice.

“I know, baby,” she whispered. “I know. He wanted to see you, too. But… we didn’t want you to remember him like that. He didn’t want that, either.”

Sellia hiccupped, her breath coming in uneven bursts. “But… but I *don’t care* -”

“*He* cared,” Elia whispered, voice breaking. “He wanted you to remember him strong. To remember him as your hero.”

Sellia looked up at her then, her eyes red, her cheeks damp, her entire world crumbling in front of her.

She sniffled, swallowing down another sob.

“Can we bring him back?” she pleaded, voice so small, so desperate, it physically hurt . “Please? Mom, please - *I’ll do anything.”*

Ellia couldn’t take it.

She pulled Sellia back into her arms, holding her so tightly it felt like she’d never let go. She buried her face in her daughter’s hair, her tears slipping silently into the soft strands.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered, voice raw, wrecked, barely more than a breath.

Sellia broke all over again.

And there, in the stillness of the morning, in the hollow emptiness of a world without him, they shattered together.

---

The funeral came a week later.

It was sunny, of course.

*Al would have liked that,* Elia thought bitterly. Bright and clear and warm, even when it felt like her whole world was drowning in shadows.

Sellia clung to Elia’s side, a small, solemn figure in a navy dress. She hadn’t spoken all morning. Just stared ahead, her eyes hollow, holding a drawing in her hands that she’d refused to let go of - a picture she’d made last week of their family. All three of them were smiling.

Naim spoke first. His voice cracked halfway through, and he had to stop and collect himself before finishing. Ide was brave enough to follow, her words clipped and quiet, but every syllable trembled. Everytime one of his friends went up to speak, each as sad as the last, Elia wondered if they knew how happy Alius would have been. That all of his friends were together again, all for *him.*

Then came his mother.

She didn’t write a speech. She just stood at the podium, looked at the sky, and said, “He was my boy. He made me proud every day of his life.” 

And then she cried.

Elia didn’t think she could stand. But when her name was called, she walked anyway - legs numb, heart screaming - and looked out at the sea of faces. So many people. So many lives he touched.

“I met Al when I was six,” she said. Her voice shook, but she didn’t stop. “And somehow, he was already saving me, just by being kind. That’s who he was. Kind. Infuriating. Stubborn.”

A soft ripple of laughter.

She smiled, and it hurt. “He was everything I needed… before I even knew I needed it. He was my first love. My only love. The father of our child. My partner. My heart.”

Her hands gripped the podium.

“I don’t know how to live without him. Sometimes, I don’t *want* to. But he told me… he made me promise… that I would keep going. That I would take care of Sellia. That I would remember him not like this, but the way he was. Loud. Happy. Relentless.”

She took a shaky breath.

“So I will. For him.”

Her gaze dropped to the casket. 

“I love you, Al. Always.”

And then she stepped down.

---

That night, Elia couldn’t sleep.

She lay in their bed - no, *her* bed now - staring at the empty pillow beside her, wishing for a voice, a hand, anything.

She turned over.

Alius’s old hoodie was still folded on the dresser.

She rose, walked over, and pressed it to her face. It didn’t smell like him anymore. Just fabric and dust and something long gone.

But it was all she had.

She curled into it on the bed and cried herself into silence.

---

Later, when Sellia woke up screaming from a nightmare, Elia ran to her room, gathering her into her arms.

“He was gone,” Sellia sobbed. “He was right there and he was gone and I couldn’t find him.”

Elia hugged her tighter. “It’s okay, baby. It’s okay.”

“Is he really… really gone, Mommy?”

A pause. Then: “Yeah, sweetheart. He is.”

Sellia was silent, before a whisper that was more like a breathless sob escaped her. “What if I forget him? What if I forget his voice?”

“You won’t,” Elia whispered. “I promise. He’s in your blood, Sellia. He’s in every part of you. And I’ll remind you of him every day.”

Sellia curled into her chest.

“I miss him so much.”

“I do too, baby. More than anything.”

And they stayed like that until morning.

---

Alius had once said he didn’t care about becoming rich as much as he cared about being remembered. About making people smile.

And he had.

Elia smiled again, eventually.

Not because it hurt any less. Not because the grief faded. But because every smile was a way to honor him. To keep him alive, in their hearts, in their stories.

Sellia kept drawing him. And when she became the greatest, kindest artist in the world? She dedicated it to her father, her hero .

His mother kept telling stories. Stories of her son, her granddaughter and how *similar* they are. How brave and kind her daughter-in-law is. She told stories of her family.

And Elia kept going.

Because Alius would have wanted her to.

Because time may not be kind…

…but love always was.

---

*10 years later*

The music drifted on a breeze that smelled faintly of blossoms and memory. Petals floated from the nearby trees as if the world itself was blessing this day.

Elia stood at the edge of the garden, hands folded around a bouquet of baby’s breath - Alius’s favorite flowers. Her golden hair was streaked with silver now, but her eyes held the same warm blue they always had. They shimmered today.

Her daughter was getting married.

Sellia laughed softly across the lawn, her gown trailing behind her like a river of moonlight. She was radiant. And not just in the usual way brides are. There was something else about her today - something familiar. A fire in her smile. A glow in her gaze. Elia saw him in every step she took.

Alius would’ve been wrecked today.

He would’ve cried during the vows, tried not to but failed. He would’ve pulled Sellia into the tightest hug and whispered how proud he was. How beautiful she looked. He would’ve danced too long at the reception, told every guest ten times over how lucky he was to be her dad.

Elia blinked slowly, breathing in through her nose.

There were pictures of him tucked in frames along the aisle. A locket around Sellia’s neck. A small seat beside Elia left open, an old hoodie perched gently on top.

Sellia’s voice pulled her out of the memory.

“Mom? Are you okay?”

Elia turned, lips parting.

Sellia stood before her, bouquet in one hand, the other slightly raised like she was still uncertain she wasn’t dreaming. Her smile was trembling now, just a little. It was the same look she had when she announced her engagement.

The same look Alius had when Sellia had said yes to his proposal.

“Will you come with me?” Elia asked, voice soft. “Just for a moment?”

Sellia smirked, but set her bouquet gently in the chair beside her before moving to follow her. “Not an answer to my question, but sure.”

They stepped away from the main path, just enough to be wrapped in shade and soft wind and the hush of the garden around them. Elia’s hands were shaking now.

“There’s something I need you to hold. Just for a bit,” Elia said, reaching into the little clutch by her side and drawing out a folded envelope. The paper had yellowed slightly with age. It was worn at the edges, the ink faded, but the handwriting on the front was unmistakable.

  
*To Sellia, on her wedding day.*

*- Dad*

  
Sellia froze.

Her breath caught in her throat as her eyes locked onto the familiar scrawl. Her fingers reached for it hesitantly, as though it might vanish the moment she touched it. She took it from Elia with both hands, reverent, cradling it like something sacred.

For a long moment, she didn’t move.

Then, slowly, Sellia sat down on the low stone bench behind her. Her gown pooled around her, forgotten. She broke the seal.

Elia stood back, watching.

Sellia’s eyes scanned the page once. Then again. Her breath hitched - once, twice - and then the first tear slipped down her cheek.

She pressed a hand to her mouth. A silent sob shook through her shoulders.

She read it all the way through, and then again, her lips trembling now as she mouthed some of the words like she was afraid she’d lose them if she didn’t say them out loud.

And then she broke.

Her whole body curled in around the letter, her forehead pressing to the parchment like if she could just get close enough, she might feel his heartbeat in the paper.

Elia knelt beside her, wrapping an arm around her shoulders, saying nothing.

Sellia clutched the letter to her chest.

“He really wrote this,” she whispered. Her voice cracked like a fault line. “He really… he knew this day would come.”

Elia nodded, tears slipping down her own cheeks now. “Of course he did. Who else has handwriting that bad?” she teased.

Sellia laughed, the sound light as though a weight had lifted off her chest. “I do, Mommy.”

Elia leaned her forehead against her daughter’s. “Obviously, you only got his best traits.”

Sellia was crying freely now, but she smiled through it. A soft, devastated smile. The kind that comes from a love so deep it aches.

“I miss him so much,” she whispered.

“I know, baby.” Elia kissed her temple. “I do too.”

They stayed like that for a while - just mother and daughter, wrapped in the quiet ache of memory and the hush of wind through flowers.

Then Sellia straightened, folding the letter carefully, reverently, and tucking it close to her heart.

“I think I’m gonna have it framed. So, y’know, gotta keep it safe.”

Elia gave her daughter a knowing smile, but decided to hold back on the teasing. “I think he’d like that a lot.”

They were interrupted by a man behind them, clearing his throat.

“Excuse me. I believe they are ready for you.”

Sellia blinked, then nodded. She turned to her mother and reached out. 

“Come with me?”

Elia’s heart stuttered. “You sure? You don’t want-?”


“I want you.”

So Elia took her hand, and they walked down the aisle together, arm in arm. Elia’s steps were slow, steady, gentle. Sellia’s were brave, firm, bright.

When they reached the front, Sellia leaned over and kissed her cheek.

“For Dad,” she whispered. “He’s here, right?”

Her mother smiled through the tears building behind her lashes.

“Always.”

*Dear Sellia,*

*If you're reading this… wow. You're probably in a dress. And you're probably rolling your eyes that I left something cheesy behind.*

*Sorry. I couldn't help myself.*

*The truth is, I always knew I'd want to say something on this day. Even if I wasn’t around to say it out loud.*

*I bet you look beautiful. I bet your smile lights up the whole world, just like your mom’s always did. And I bet whoever’s standing next to you right now - holding your hand, looking at you like you’re their whole world - is the luckiest person alive.*

*I wish I could be there. More than anything.*

*But if I can't walk you down the aisle, if I can't tell you how proud I am while sobbing like a total mess and embarrass you in front of all your friends, then let me tell you here, in the only way I can:*

*You are the best thing I ever did.*

*You were light when the world got dark. You were laughter when I forgot how to smile. You are my greatest adventure.*

*I watched you grow into someone strong and kind and clever and stubborn (you get that from your mom). I watched you chase dreams, fall down, get back up - every single time. You always had this fire. You still do.*  
*And today, you're not just starting a new chapter. You're building something of your own.*   
*That’s huge.*  

*But you’re not alone. You never have been.*

*I hope you carry love with you. I hope you fight for it, like your mom and I did. I hope you find joy in small things. In warm mornings and quiet nights. In your partner’s laugh. In the family you choose. And I hope you know - no matter where I am - that I’m cheering you on. Every step. Every breath.*

*When you dance tonight, save one for me, okay?*  
*I’ll be there. Always.*

*Love you forever,*  
*Daddy*

  
  
## Juani - OF THE END OF THE KNIGHT, AND THE START ANEW OF HOPE AGAINST THE RADIANT BEING  
  
::: warning Author's Note  
Lostbelt 7 Spoilers  
Please take this with a Grain of Salt it’s been 2 years since I read Lostbelt 7 and I really need to re-read it  
:::  
  
It’s a grim sight all around, the world is collapsing all around as it turns to crystals and shatters, reality distorts and the earth trembles from the movements of this being humans were not meant to confront.  
  
The <ruby>Knight<rt>Old Man</rt></ruby> looks at this environment, he can’t help but shudder in fear as he looks at his surroundings, his attendant right beside him isn’t much different, a pale face and a grim resolve, however even that isn’t much in the face of this colossal enemy.  
He is aware. Aware of the fact that many great Heroes, Humans and Gods alike have fallen just to get to this point, the fact the Knights he so much admires have already fallen before him, that the straits are this dire for him to be needed. Aware that he cannot make a change, that perhaps, answering this summoning was a meaningless task, there were still heroes that could answer this summon, it’s an even more hopeless situation than the records he saw of the Battle against the Gods of Machines.  
And yet even so, when he looks back, he sees a face that he can’t feel like he cannot give up on, that exhausted face that is willing to spend all they have and more, just for the sake of living, he can’t feel like running away now, even if it only buys a second, no, perhaps only a millisecond of time against this being of colossal proportions his mind cannot even begin to understand, he decided he should be here now, for those he truly considers “Heroes”, because he, no, because they knew, this time, it’s not an option to retreat.   
If it’s to protect those dreams… those virtues… Don Quixote shall remain victorious until the very end after all  
  
“Sancho.”  
“Yes, sir?”  
“It’s time to go”  
“...”  
“My lord, my Master! Watch, this will not be the first, nor the last time you see, for now, I, Don Quixote de La Macha, shall fell a Giant once more!”  
  
A barrage of light assaults their eyes as attacks come through, but even so, Magical Energy gathers, the Knight uses his Lance to try and attack, these attacks are practically meaningless, but that wasn’t his goal from the start, his Sprint goes forward against one of the Legs of the titan in front of him, as his attendant is engulfed by bright light  
  
“O’ Radiant Giant, my name is of no matter to you, but I shall say it again either way, I am Don Quixote, Don Quixote de La Mancha! In the name of my Lord, I shall strike you down! Sancho, Rocinante, no, Dulcinea! I’d like you to be with me for this!”  
“.... yes Sir! I’ll stay with you until the very end of this story! Activating Noble Phantasm!”  
  
# <ruby>““Valiente Asalto Dedicado a LA PRINCESA!””<rt>I Dedicate This Spear to My Beloved Princess!</rt></ruby>  
  
A bright light engulfs the attendant/steed/princess and the now Golden Armored Knight, as they gallop on in a bright dash, it’s a desperate struggle, even the replication of his great feat is nothing to such being, but that’s fine, that’s how it’s meant to be.  
The being of light attacks rampantly as the crystals expand everywhere, it wasn’t enough to even push the being back, perhaps not even draw it’s attention, but the attacks come nonetheless, the now tired Knight and attendant being knocked back, even if it’s with their lives, it should buy a slight amount of time.  
Rays of light and crystals eventually overwhelm him, as the Old Knight falls backwards, he looks back towards where his Master is, that same desperate look hasn’t left their face, but instead of greeting them with the scared face he had first shown, he shows a relieved smile  
  
“Don’t worry Master, I believe in you, you who has overcome the Gods themselves, can do what this Old Man couldn’t”  
“The Knight of Reality has fallen, but that’s why, I am sure you can open the Door of Dreams once again, I am sure of it”  
“Sancho…”  
  
The old man looks up, and there, he sees his princess, she is gently smiling in resignation, at this foolish, virtuous and brave Old Man, she can’t maintain her manifestation for much longer either.  
  
“It’s alright, let's return to reality together, my master.”  
  
They both start chanting together, as if it wasn’t a a chant, but a lullaby for a good-night’s sleep, perhaps, it was not directed for each other, but for their Master looking from behind, and for those that will come after  
  
““... Go back, go back, go back.””  
““The book ends, and you awake with the cold splash of reality.””  
““It all fades into the past like a passing by fever dream””  
““We must abandon our dreams in order to survive””  
““Activating Noble Phantasm, Return to Reality””  
  
# <ruby>““Triste Suave Alonso Quijano””<rt>I Offer You Kind, Miserable Reality</rt></ruby>  
  
For an instant, crystals recede upon the wish the power of reality brought, it’s but a slight moment of breathing room, but that’s all the two who are leaving the others behind hoped for, this hopeless knight and his loyal squire, this time look quite satisfied even in such hopeless situation, the squire would normally be indifferent, but upon looking at the knight who talks about returning to reality with such a dreamy face after acting, no, being a hero, it’s almost laughable. One could almost imagine lush plains and windmills around them, as they slowly start to vanish, and crystalize, shattering  
It only lasted but a moment, but that moment extended to ages, upon seeing the valiant knight fight for this seconds, it was as if a ephemeral shooting star had passed by, perhaps it didn’t truly grant a wish, but as long as everyone believed it did, it would certainly come true, and as if to respond to that wish, heroes answered the call in response to their Master, and in response to those who have been left behind, it will certainly be alright, after all, Don Quixote always came victorious when it came to virtue. They will certainly carry this virtue, this hope, until the end of their journey.  
How do I know this? Well, it’s a Squire’s task to record the great adventures of her Lord, right?  
  
## Thorne - The Last Day of Deirdre an Bhróin  
  
“A majestic piece of work, isn’t it?” the man across me says, gesturing behind him to the imposing castle our carriage rides to. Less a palace and more a mass of iron and stone, the fortress sits on the edge of a bluff a ways past a lake I forget the name of, its presence far out-shadowing its size. Wicked spires sprout from its innards, glorified birdcages darkening the already cloudy sky. One of them will be mine soon.  
  
“I was surprised to hear you took my offer after all, you know,” he continues, ignoring my silence, “I mean, Éoghan mac Durthacht! I figured you’d rather die than spend the rest of your years with him.”  
  
The man’s name is Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulster, and for the past year, he has been the foremost object of my hatred. Forced into becoming his unwilling bride, I have experienced first-hand what it means to be a hostage of his wanton lust for control; his desire to grasp what is not his — not anyone’s — in the palm of his hand. Now that he has tired of me and my own unwillingness to play his games, he has found it fit to dispose of me, placing me in the hands of an equally detestable individual: Éoghan mac Durthacht, king of Fernmag, and the one who took *Him* from this world too soon. I ought to strangle him with my bare hands, grant all of them retribution, and yet—  
  
—And yet, despite how righteous my vengeance burns, a cold seed of doubt nestles itself in my heart.  
  
---  
  
It is a well-kept secret, one known only to a select few outside of those present at my birth, but since the moment I was born, those around me have been cursed to know naught but pain.  
  
Perhaps it was a punishment from the gods, a cruel trick made to punish my father for a particularly irreverent performance. Perhaps my mother was more than she let on: I would never know, given she died in childbirth. Regardless, I have lived my life burdened by this curse of mine, born to have anyone I know idolize, but never truly love, me. It was for this reason that the sage Cathbad ordered that I be named Deirdre — broken-hearted, for the ruin I would bring should I be let to live, and the hole in my heart that would never be filled. There is a part of me that believes I should have died that night, had they and that bastard king Conchobar advised otherwise. If he had let his mind govern his decree and not his loins, as kings often do, Ulster would not find itself on the brink of undoneness as it does now. The seed whispers to me again, convincing me that if I had never been born, this suffering could have all been avoided.  
  
Perhaps it is so, I think, but were that true, that would mean…  
  
There was a light in my life, once. Back when it was only Leabharcham and I surviving off the land, I was graced with a prophecy that would shape the course of my life thereafter. It told me of a hero with skin as fair as the winter snow, cheeks flushed blood-red, and hair as dark as the raven which supped from it. I begged her with all my heart to meet *Him*, to know *Him*, to hope against hope that if anyone would see me for who I truly was, it was *Him*.  
  
I should have known that convincing her would be all of our undoings.  
  
As promised, I met Him, and alongside His brothers, we eloped on a whirlwind romance far from the clutches of Conchobar and his men. Alas, the mad king eventually found us hidden in Alba, deceiving the great warrior Fergus mac Róich into returning us to him. With my words veiled in song and prophecy, I begged them not to return. That if we stayed here, they would not have to lay down their lives for my sake. Yet despite it all, they—  
  
---  
  
A bump in the road wrests me from my thoughts, the memories fading away as I am brought back to the present. The castle draws near, now. The imposing shadows it casts seem to stop right where the rocky patch of road we ride on ends, as if signaling the point of no return for our carriage; for me. The rocks around us sprout from the ground at jagged, sharp angles, wicked flowers in full bloom. A fitting setpiece for Éoghan, I muse. Gazing upon them fills me with an acute sense of dread, and yet, they almost seem to beckon for me, as if they know the pain of the flesh outweighs the anguish I stand to face. A plan, haphazard yet effective, forms.  
  
Conchobar, miraculously, continues to prattle on, seemingly taunting me about something or other I cannot be bothered to hear anymore. The wheels in my head spin like lightning, a battle raging within as to whether I truly commit to this plan of mine; if death is truly better than chains. I try to reason with myself, the seed of doubt doing its best to justify my so-called penance, but in this moment, it is incinerated by my burning desire to be rid of it all. To be free.   
  
I open the carriage door, and as I hang over the edge, wind tousling my once-fiery hair, I remember it all.   
  
I remember how despite it all, they didn’t listen. They, who insisted that they would protect me on their honor as warriors, died for their valor, impaled all at once by the loathsome Éoghan mac Durthacht, king of Fernmag. I was captured in the aftermath, another victim of Conchobar’s conquests, and Fergus defected from Ulster in disgust. All according to the mad king’s design, I suppose.  
  
Perhaps I should have thrown myself in with them; had the minstrels romanticize our last moments as ones spent together. If for no one else, that would have saved me from the suffering I have endured this arduous year. I was too cowardly to do so back then, but I will not make the same mistake this time.  
  
Conchobar’s eyes widen as I fall wordlessly from the carriage, my face as stony as it has been this past year; as the rocks I will surely dash myself across. I will not permit him the mercy of understanding my feelings in these final moments, for those are only for myself and the gods above to know. As I fall, an emotion I have long repressed finally begins to awaken, and I scoff at it in my heart of hearts for having taken so long to blossom.  
  
Hate, after all, is but another facet of love.  
  
Time seems to slow as I remember that fateful day, when I lost everything to the spear of Éoghan mac Durthacht. That man, who killed my love, his brothers, and countless more; who Conchobar ‘entrusted’ me to… I despise him with all my heart. I wish the king he serves one thousand curses, for he let his love for a flower not yet bloomed overtake him, destroying us in his wanton pursuit of it. I hate this country for showering me in what they claim to be love. I take their happiness in its entirety and turn it to scorn for what they have done, what they have let pass and will let pass again. I am not the first that has done so, and I will not be the last.  
  
And finally, after all is said and done, I quietly curse the name of my love, who ‘loved’ me enough to die for me but not enough to heed my words. You, who gave me the closest thing I knew to love, died too soon for us both.  
  
It’s okay, Naoise. I’ll catch up to you soon.  
  
## Amala - The Computer in the Sea of the Moon  
  
I awaken in a sea of bright blue, fragments spiraling all around me as my mind awakens  
within the confines of the, now secluded and isolated, space twisting around me. Vast as space  
it spans, spiraling more and more within my sight as the **<span style="color: #0020FF">Moon Cell</span>** proceeds to coil labyrinthine  
see through corridors around me; digital vastness showing me everything and nothing  
simultaneously. The effigy behind me, as silent as the sinking depths around me,  
accompanying the past within me. Walking forward, my brain proceeds to go into overdrive,  
passing digital bubbles and divine essence. The agitation through the **<span style="color: #9900FF">Spiritron</span>** digitization  
coursing through me creates an overwhelming, if slightly terrifying, depth of emptiness; knowing  
that I do not know myself or my surroundings, yet knowledge of these divine depths proceeds to  
usher me to an empty room of other souls, black darkness surrounding me amidst the chaos,  
dead, killed by the solid and calculating effigies around. Things blur as the effigy behind me tried  
to defend myself; the wood failing as it collapses to its duplicate. As I now find myself at a loss,  
the other knocks me down; the blood of my soul pouring out from within en masse. I can’t die, I  
can’t die, I can’t die, say this broken mind of mine, as I try to stand; wobbling and seeing red,  
with a searing on my hand clear as day as the **<span style="color: #FF0021">Command Seal</span>** appears;bringing forth what  
appears to be a regal woman in red, beauty piercing through the dark as my mind fades asking  
me a question I had failed to hear from my **<span style="color: #72761D">Servant</span>** earlier “ Now then, I shall ask you once  
more. Answer me. Are you my Master” the beauty in red asks, pulling a nod from me as I fall  
unconscious into darkness
