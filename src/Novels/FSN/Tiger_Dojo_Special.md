# FSN Tiger Dojo Special  
  
  
  
Thank you for your hard work.  
  
---  
  
Congratulations on clearing the main story and collecting all the Tiger Stamps.  
  
---  
  
Congratulations!  
  
---  
  
Welcome to the Tiger Dojo Special that rewards you for clearing the long story of Fate and completing the Tiger Stamps!  
  
---  
  
I have nothing to say if you've played this game to this degree.  
  
---  
  
Yes, you can go anywhere, sir!  
  
---  
  
Yeah, we can finally say goodbye to mouse-clicking hell.  
  
---  
  
Well, we're on our incentive trip and are at Einzbern's secret hot spring, the Valhalla Hot Spring.  
  
---  
  
How do you like the hot spring, Taiga?  
  
---  
  
It's great. It's really relaxing.  
  
---  
  
I feel like I'll go to heaven if I relax a little too much.  
  
---  
  
Right? The benefits of this hot spring include relieving fatigue and sending souls to heaven.  
  
---  
  
You won't be able to come back if you drop your guard.  
  
---  
  
Huh......!?  
  
---  
  
I think I saw a butter field...!  
  
---  
  
That was close. I shouldn't sleep in the bath.  
  
---  
  
Well this is the grand finale of the Tiger Dojo.  
  
---  
  
We will now hold a review meeting to wrap up Fate.  
  
---  
  
Hey, it's boring to be scolded until the very end.  
  
---  
  
We're at a hot spring, so let's just stick to talking about what happened.  
  
---  
  
Huh!? I'm being expostulated by an underage loli-girl?  
  
---  
  
But you're right. The hot spring feels good. Review meetings are what lions do[heart]  
  
---  
  
Yeah, I contemplate my actions. Let's look back at what's happened without thinking about anything.  
  
---  
  
So, what was your favorite part of the main story?  
  
---  
  
Me? Hmm, I'll say the part where I got killed in Rin's route. There wasn't a CG there, but they added one later on.  
  
---  
  
Oh, the one where you get your heart ripped out? Yeah, my heart skipped on that scene.  
  
---  
  
Why don't you just die like that?  
  
---  
  
I'm talking about the CG of me and Berserker.  
  
---  
  
By the way, the one you're talking about is a mysterious CG that was the top candidate to be dumped, but was completed and inserted before everyone realized it.  
  
---  
  
I-I see.  
  
---  
  
That's weird. So they kept such a nasty CG and dumped the one where I transform using the God of Babylonia's power to fight one-on-one against Angra Manyu?  
  
---  
  
&mdash;Hey, Taiga. It doesn't matter, but it's Jaguar Man that transforms using the God of Babylonia's power. It's not tiger.  
  
---  
  
What!? No way! But that tiger with the mantle has these really cute whiskers!  
  
---  
  
If having whiskers makes you a tiger, even Mobi** Suits will be tigers.  
  
---  
  
Shock! It's as shocking as finding out oshiruko and zenzai are two different kinds of food!  
  
---  
  
Sigh... I've been wondering, but why are you concerned about tigers?  
  
---  
  
You don't like being called Tiger, but the clothes you wear have tiger patterns. Do you like them or not?  
  
---  
  
Hm. I love them and detest them at the same time.  
  
---  
  
......Well, okay. People have their tastes, so I won't pursue the question.  
  
---  
  
So, what part of the main story is your favorite?  
  
---  
  
Hmm. I like the opening movie.  
  
---  
  
Especially the part where Fujimura Taiga shows up.  
  
---  
  
I guess it was stupid of me to ask.  
  
---  
  
We won't make any progress like this, so let's go in order.  
  
---  
  
We'll start out with the first part, Saber route.  
  
---  
  
It's a route that represents the game Fate, just like the route name "Fate" indicates.  
  
---  
  
I have no complaint about this route because I have a big part and Taiga comes out in the ending.  
  
---  
  
Yeah. I was one of the main heroines back then. Time sure is cruel. Fufufu. I should kill the guy who wrote the story[heart]  
  
---  
  
Okay, don't feel sorry for yourself.  
  
---  
  
The purpose of Saber's route is to give the details of the Holy Grail War with the main focus on Saber.  
  
---  
  
It's a standard story intended for beginner Masters.  
  
---  
  
You were one of the bosses too.  
  
---  
  
Shirou had to part with Saber-chan, but this should make him stronger...  
  
---  
  
...Wait.  
  
---  
  
Does that mean there's a big danger of Shirou becoming Archer-san in this route?  
  
---  
  
That would depend on how Shirou lives.  
  
---  
  
Well, I think that's a pretty small possibility. I'm by his side, after all.  
  
---  
  
I see. I'm relieved to know that Shirou will head down the path of evil with this small devil.  
  
---  
  
Oh, wait a minute.  
  
---  
  
You can live that long, Illya-chan!?  
  
---  
  
That's a secret.  
  
---  
  
Well, everyone eventually dies, so don't worry about it.  
  
---  
  
So, next is Rin route, "Unlimited Blade Works"...  
  
---  
  
It follows many perspectives, and the story is more oriented towards the Servants.  
  
---  
  
And quite frankly...  
  
---  
  
We had no part in the story.  
  
---  
  
Illya-chan exited the stage midway, and I was treated without much consideration.  
  
---  
  
You're always treated without consideration.  
  
---  
  
Guwa! The truth pierces my heart!  
  
---  
  
But Tohsaka-san's pretty unimportant, even though she's the main heroine.  
  
---  
  
I think Archer took all the great moments.  
  
---  
  
That can't be helped.  
  
---  
  
As the title "Unlimited Blade Works" indicates, Rin's route is a story about Shirou.  
  
---  
  
"Fate" and "Unlimited Blade Works" are two sides of one story.  
  
---  
  
Shirou is the protagonist of this game, so the game has to be about Shirou.  
  
---  
  
He's a pretty warped person, after all.  
  
---  
  
I see.  
  
---  
  
So the first two routes completely covered all the themes.  
  
---  
  
Yup.  
  
---  
  
So this is the front side of Fate. The story you get if you do everything you can as a Master.  
  
---  
  
Next is Sakura's route, the back side of Fate.  
  
---  
  
It's the deadly struggle chapter, where you fight through from the beginning to the end of the Holy Grail War!  
  
---  
  
Deadly struggle chapter, huh? You're right. You die the most in Sakura-chan's route, after all.  
  
---  
  
I can't laugh at how the shortest route ended up being the longest.  
  
---  
  
There would've been a route for me and Illya-chan if this one had been shorter.  
  
---  
  
Your route didn't exist from the plot stage.  
  
---  
  
Well, Sakura-chan's route was full of quick twists and turns, but what do you think, Illya-chan?  
  
---  
  
Can you call it a grand finale?  
  
---  
  
Of course you can. Something ridiculous like the Great Holy Grail was destroyed, and everyone's alive except me and Saber.  
  
---  
  
You can't ask for more.  
  
---  
  
Oh. But I guess there was a plan to have a ridiculous ending where Sakura-chan, Rider-san, and Saber-chan are alive.  
  
---  
  
................Um, is that heaven?  
  
---  
  
It's more like hell than heaven.  
  
---  
  
Well, life's fun because you can't have it your way. It's just right when some people are missing.  
  
---  
  
Wow, your words are filled with dignity.  
  
---  
  
As expected from a character that's both a younger sister and an older sister.  
  
---  
  
So, would you say Shirou is your younger brother or your older brother?  
  
---  
  
That's a secret!  
  
---  
  
As I have both attributes, Shirou also has both!  
  
---  
  
Oh, I understand.  
  
---  
  
But it's interesting and sad at the same time, considering that he might end up like Archer-san if he matures in the wrong way.  
  
---  
  
Well, it'll depend on how he grows up, so let's leave it to Rin and Sakura.  
  
---  
  
I said it before, but Fate is Shirou's story. The question of how Shirou should exist is presented in Saber and Rin's routes.  
  
---  
  
One of the answers is Sakura's route, "Heavens Feel".  
  
---  
  
We don't even need to say what the answer was.  
  
---  
  
He lost many things, but he'll be accumulating new things from now on.  
  
---  
  
Yup. That's why this is a grand finale.  
  
---  
  
Everyone's going to be as happy as they can get.  
  
---  
  
Oh, you're such a good girl. We don't learn how good you are until after you're dead. You really are like an evil heroine.  
  
---  
  
Heh. That's my role from the beginning. I have no regrets.  
  
---  
  
The rest is a battle for the remaining people. I'm just going to enjoy my hot spring and look down at the earth.  
  
---  
  
I see.  
  
---  
  
Then let's wrap this up nicely with a smile, pupil number one!  
  
---  
  
Osu, all right, master!  
  
---  
  
All right!  
  
---  
  
This is the end of Fate/stay night!  
  
---  
  
Thanks for not getting discouraged from the long playing time and fighting through the whole game!  
  
---  
  
Yeah, thanks for playing the game!  
  
---  
  
We took part after every dead end, but our duties are over now.  
  
---  
  
This is the real farewell, but let's meet again in the main story!  
  
---  
  
Goodbye! Don't die again!  
  
---  
  
Goodbye!  
  
---  
  
Huh...? By the way, Illya-chan. Were you saying something about looking down at earth from here?  
  
---  
  
Yeah. I said I'll watch over the earth from here.  
  
---  
  
.........C-C-Could this hot spring be...  
  
---  
  
Um...... Heaven?  
  
---  
  
Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!  
  
---  
  
It's not ending nicely at all!!
