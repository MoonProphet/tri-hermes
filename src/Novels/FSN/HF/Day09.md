## Scene 00 Sakura collapses  
  
  
  
Morning.  
  
When the bright sunlight wakes me, I realize my neck is stiff.  
  
---  
  
"Mm――――whoa......"  
  
My neck feels heavy because my shoulders are stiff.  
  
I probably strained my neck when I slept on my stomach.  
  
---  
  
On the other hand, my back feels much better now.  
  
I don't feel any pain, so it shouldn't hinder my normal life.  
  
"―――Crap. It's past seven."  
  
---  
  
"Ouch!"  
  
I feel a sharp pain in my stomach.  
  
It's fine as long as I stay still, but it hurts when I suddenly move.  
  
---  
  
"―――It's a bruise, so I bet it'll hurt for a while."  
  
But it's nothing I can't endure.  
  
It's not like it's bad enough to stop me from moving, so I should be able to act normally.  
  
---  
  
I get changed and leave my room.  
  
I smell breakfast from the living room, so I bet Sakura's preparing it.  
  
---  
  
"Morning. I'm sorry I slept in. Is there anything I can still help with?"  
  
"Good morning, Senpai. It's rare for you to sleep in."  
  
"Ugh, I'm sorry. Um, it was already morning when I noticed."  
  
---  
  
"It can't be helped because you're injured. I went to wake you up earlier, but you didn't even show signs of waking up. I think your body's tired."  
  
---  
  
Wow.  
  
I have no memory of Sakura coming to wake me up.  
  
Not only are my shoulders stiff, but it seems my head is still asleep.  
  
---  
  
"I'm sorry. I'm gonna go wash my face. I'll be back right away."  
  
"No, please take your time. I'll prepare breakfast by myself today, so please go wash your face."  
  
Sakura is really energetic.  
  
---  
  
"......?"  
  
Well, if she's making the offer, I shouldn't turn her down.  
  
"Then I'll go ahead and go wash my face."  
  
---  
  
"Yes. I'm confident in today's miso soup, so please look forward to it."  
  
I nod and head into the hallway.  
  
---  
  
"―――――Wait."  
  
Something's strange.  
  
I went past her without caring because she was energetic, but this is just like―――  
  
---  
  
"......!"  
  
I hear something falling to the ground.  
  
I don't know if it's because I've heard it many times these past few days, but I realize it's the sound of someone falling.  
  
---  
  
"Sakura――――!"  
  
I run back into the living room.  
  
...Sakura must have been on the ground, as she slowly raises her upper body.  
  
---  
  
"Sakura."  
  
I support her staggering body.  
  
---  
  
"......!"  
  
Her body is hot, just like before.  
  
Her breathing is ragged and her shirt is wet with her sweat, telling me how bad her condition is.  
  
---  
  
"Oh――――Senpai."  
  
She must have come to her senses.  
  
Sakura looks at me with unfocused eyes.  
  
---  
  
"Geez. I told you to take your time, but you came back right away. ...Um, please hold on. I'll prepare breakfast right away."  
  
She smiles and brushes my hand off of her.  
  
---  
  
"――――Sakura."  
  
It doesn't seem like she's pushing herself, but rather that she doesn't notice she's sick.  
  
---  
  
"Hold on. You don't have to make breakfast. Just go back to your room and lie down. You have a high fever."  
  
"Huh...? I have a fever?"  
  
---  
  
"Yes. ...Damn, it's really bad if you don't know it yourself! Why――――"  
  
Why didn't I notice something so obvious?  
  
Even though I was depressed about Saber, there's something wrong with me if I can't care for Sakura's health.  
  
---  
  
"Um, Senpai...? I'm really fine. I just fell, so it's not like I'm dizzy or anything..."  
  
---  
  
"Don't say stupid things! You have such a high fever! I don't even need a thermometer to tell that!"  
  
---  
  
"Oh――――"  
  
---  
  
I pull her into the living room.  
  
I have to let Sakura rest for now.  
  
I'll report to the school that she's going to be absent, make some breakfast that's easy to digest, and for lunch―――yeah, I'll ask Fujimura's old man and have one of their housekeepers come over.  
  
---  
  
"U-Um... where are you going, Senpai? We have to eat breakfast before we go to school."  
  
---  
  
Sakura still hasn't grasped the situation.  
  
All her energy must have been a result of the fever.  
  
---  
  
"You're not going to school. You're resting in your room today. I'll let the school know. I'm going to see Fuji-Nee in class, so I'll tell her then."  
  
---  
  
"Eh――――I'm not going to school?"  
  
"Right. Who else would it be? I'm... well, I'm injured, but I'll be fine. There's no reason for me to stay home."  
  
"――――――――"  
  
---  
  
...Well, there's no reason for me to push myself and go to school. Because I lost Saber, I don't have such liberty.  
  
But there's something I have to do.  
  
I can't be staying in my house until I go tell Tohsaka about last night―――about Matou Zouken and Assassin.  
  
---  
  
"Anyway, you're to stay home today. You're working hard every day, so you can rest once in a while. I'll come home right away after I'm done with my business."  
  
---  
  
"Oh―――no, I'm really fine...!  
  
So let's eat breakfast and go to school. This fever will go away if I do...!"  
  
"Such a thing won't happen, you idiot. You're being absurd, Sakura."  
  
---  
  
"I-I'm not being absurd!  
  
You're the one being reckless. I'm feeling perfectly fine, and you're injured! But I'm the only one staying home? That's――――"  
  
"Eh... Whoa, Sakura!"  
  
---  
  
"H――――uh? That's strange, Senpai. I'm... having trouble... breathing――――"  
  
Sakura's breathing hard and is about to fall to the ground.  
  
---  
  
...I support her, but her body is heavy.  
  
She must not have the power to stand up, or maybe she can't stand up because her body is heavy.  
  
Either way, Sakura's so sick that she can't walk by herself, and she's the only one who thinks she's fine.  
  
---  
  
"...You idiot. Look, I'm going to make you stay home today no matter what. I don't care if you don't like it or not, but you'll end up staying home tomorrow too if you use up extra energy."  
  
---  
  
"......But, Senpai. I... have to... go to school."  
  
Delirious, Sakura punctuates her sentence with ragged breaths.  
  
"――――――――"  
  
Ignoring her, I lift her up and head to the guest room.  
  
---  
  
She's already asleep when I get there.  
  
But she must still be semi-conscious.  
  
She's breathing painfully and takes a firm grip on my arm.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I lay her on the bed.  
  
"Oh... Senpai...?"  
  
Her voice is vague.  
  
Sakura is staring at the ceiling, not at me.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――Sakura."  
  
Her ragged breathing, flushed cheeks, sweat-dampened clothes, and heaving breasts...  
  
---  
  
"――――――!"  
  
She looks so erotic that I quickly look away.  
  
Why am I so imprudent when Sakura's sick!?  
  
---  
  
"...Crap. I guess I'll have to ask their housekeeper."  
  
...I can't change her clothes or wipe her down.  
  
---  
  
Her breathing has calmed down since she is lying down, so she should get better with some fever medicine.  
  
Once she can walk again, I can take her to the hospital to go get some medicine.  
  
---  
  
"Sakura. I'm going to go get someone, so sleep until then. You're familiar with Fuji-Nee's housekeeper, right?"  
  
"――――――――"  
  
There's no reply.  
  
Her breathing still sounds painful, but it seems she's asleep.  
  
---  
  
"―――Phew. You're obstinate in weird ways, Sakura. Why do you want to go to school so bad?"  
  
I'm just talking to myself.  
  
I know there won't be a reply because Sakura's asleep.  
  
---  
  
"Bye. I'm going to school."  
  
I step away from the bed and head to the door.  
  
―――Then.  
  
"...I want to go to school with you, Senpai."  
  
I hear her answer.  
  
---  
  
"Sakura...?"  
  
I turn around.  
  
Sakura is still asleep, and her eyes are closed painfully.  
  
"...Oh, she's just talking in her sleep."  
  
---  
  
I leave the guest room.  
  
On my way out...  
  
---  
  
"......Because I have to protect Senpai."  
  
---  
  
She says this in feverish tones.  
  
---  
  
I drop by Fuji-Nee's place on my way to school to have their housekeeper come by.  
  
I sometimes forget because Fuji-Nee's not the type to dress up, but the Fujimura family is one of the richest households around here.  
  
---  
  
It has dozens of scary-looking people that call themselves company employees even though it's not even a company.  
  
Many of them live in the outbuilding, so they are a large family.  
  
So there are many housekeepers, and one will be free to spare if I ask.  
  
---  
  
―――So.  
  
I get one of the emergency housekeepers, who took care of my place a few times before Sakura started coming over.  
  
She's acquainted with Sakura, so I can trust her to take care of her.  
  
---  
  
## Scene 01 Report Rin  
  
  
  
It's lunchtime.  
  
In accordance with our agreement, I meet up with Tohsaka on the rooftop and tell her what happened last night.  
  
――――And the result is...  
  
---  
  
"Then what!?  
  
Matou Zouken is Assassin's Master, and he tried to kill you and not Saber!?"  
  
...Tohsaka getting really angry.  
  
---  
  
"T-That's right. What's with you all of a sudden?"  
  
"It's not sudden!  
  
From what I heard, Zouken tried to kill you after Saber was defeated. That's strange. The process is wrong no matter how you look at it!"  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka leans forward and glares at me.  
  
I back up just a few centimeters because of her attitude, but we're sitting in our spot behind the water tower.  
  
---  
  
"Hey. Are you listening to me, Emiya-kun? Didn't you think something was strange about what you told me?"  
  
Tohsaka Rin glares at me in dissatisfaction.  
  
---  
  
"Ugh."  
  
...As if her attitude wasn't bad enough, now she's getting right in my face.  
  
This space is small, so there's no room for me to back up.  
  
I'm like a mouse in a trap. There's nowhere for me to run.  
  
---  
  
"Umm...... What was strange?"  
  
"It's the priorities. Zouken didn't try to kill you, even though you two were alone.  
  
It was fortunate that Assassin was able to beat Saber, but there was also a chance of Assassin's defeat. Zouken should've tried to kill you, Saber's Master, as quickly as possible."  
  
---  
  
"...Well, that's true.  
  
But maybe Zouken was confident that Assassin could beat Saber."  
  
---  
  
"No way. Even you could tell that Assassin was weaker, right? Then Zouken definitely wouldn't gamble like that.  
  
...I bet he had a reason not to kill you.  
  
Well, I can think of two reasons."  
  
---  
  
"Two...? So that's..."  
  
---  
  
## Scene 02 Answer Unsatisfactory  
  
  
  
"Was he on guard against my counterattack?"  
  
---  
  
"I don't think so. From what you've said, I don't think your counterattack would've been effective. And if I were Zouken, I wouldn't leave a trapped enemy enough room to counterattack.  
  
Setting up a trap shows that you're determined to kill your opponent.  
  
If you're worried that your target will attack you once he's fallen into the trap, your trap is a failure."  
  
---  
  
"I see. An opinion expected from a perfectionist, Tohsaka."  
  
"That was just a generalization. You don't go into the cage yourself if you want to capture your opponent alive, right?"  
  
---  
  
## Scene 03 Answer Correct  
  
  
  
"...Maybe he didn't want to kill me right then?"  
  
---  
  
"...Well, I guess that's the most likely motive.  
  
I have to assume that Zouken didn't want Saber to disappear. The only negative effect of your death would be Saber's disappearance."  
  
"Yeah. That's all I'm good for."  
  
---  
  
"Hey, why are you sulking? I-I'm just talking about Zouken, so don't take it too seriously."  
  
"...? I'm not sulking. It's true. Why are you getting mad about this?"  
  
---  
  
"...! ――――I-I'm not mad.  
  
You're just misunderstanding me."  
  
---  
  
## Scene 04 Answer Correct  
  
  
  
"...I guess he was playing around. Maybe he thought he could kill me any time."  
  
---  
  
"...Yeah. I'm sure there's some other reason, but maybe he could afford to keep you alive as long as he wanted.  
  
Maybe we could take advantage of that opening..."  
  
---  
  
## Scene 05 What to do now  
  
  
  
"Anyway. Zouken had something he wanted out of Saber.  
  
He probably wanted you to stay alive as a Master. But with that aside, he had a reason to kill you.  
  
...I'll ask again. You're sure that he said you're useless, right?"  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
...I recall what happened last night.  
  
---  
  
"There are still uses for the daughter of Tohsaka.  
  
But you are of no more use――――"  
  
---  
  
"...Yeah. And he also said you're still useful."  
  
"I see. ...I don't know why you're useless now, but that must be why he's running away from me.  
  
One of us has to die if we meet. But Zouken needs both of us to stay alive for some reason, so he's hiding from me――――"  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka ponders.  
  
"............"  
  
---  
  
―――Well.  
  
I've told her what I need to tell her.  
  
If there's anything else I should say, it's――――  
  
---  
  
## Scene 06 Dead End Confrontation Miserable lone force  
  
  
  
...No, I have nothing to say to her.  
  
This is my problem.  
  
I chose to keep fighting.  
  
---  
  
Matou Zouken and Assassin.  
  
The black shadow wandering around town.  
  
The battle between Masters over the Holy Grail.  
  
I chose to fight to stop it, and sacrificed Saber.  
  
...Then I can't sacrifice anyone else.  
  
I have to fight by myself from now on.  
  
---  
  
"Emiya-kun...? Why are you so quiet?  
  
Is there something you haven't told me yet?"  
  
---  
  
"No, that's all. I lost Saber, and I'm not a Master anymore. There's no reason for me to fight you anymore."  
  
---  
  
"Yeah. If you're out of the Holy Grail War, both our truce and our promise to eventually fight are nullified. So, Emiya-kun..."  
  
"Yeah. I'm out of the war. An amateur like me has no chance of winning without Saber's help."  
  
---  
  
I stand up.  
  
Leaving Tohsaka behind me, I head for the door.  
  
---  
  
"Bye, Tohsaka. Watch out for Zouken."  
  
"Hey, Emiya-kun――――"  
  
I open the door without turning around.  
  
I leave the rooftop as if to cut off my regret.  
  
---  
  
―――The day ends.  
  
I have to wait until night even if I am to go after the shadow and Zouken.  
  
As I am much weaker, I will need useful information and a weapon.  
  
...I'll wait until night, sneak into the Ryuudou Temple, and try to obtain some information.  
  
---  
  
"―――I have to look after Sakura, too. I'll wait until night for now."  
  
Battles can wait.  
  
I want to concentrate on nursing Sakura until then.  
  
...I have some time, so I'll go to the shopping district and buy a few day's worth of groceries.  
  
---  
  
"I'm home."  
  
I call out as I go into my house.  
  
---  
  
"――――――?"  
  
...Then.  
  
I feel something strange as soon as I enter.  
  
---  
  
"―――Footprints...?"  
  
I see something like footprints on the floor.  
  
It's a trace of someone coming in with shoes on, and the house is free of any human presence.  
  
The only shoes I see are Sakura's, and it seems the housekeeper I asked for has gone home.  
  
---  
  
"Sakura."  
  
I go into the guest room.  
  
It's empty.  
  
The strange feeling turns into an ominous conviction.  
  
---  
  
I return to the living room.  
  
Sakura isn't here either.  
  
The footprints end here in the living room.  
  
Whoever the intruder was, he came in, did something here, and went back outside.  
  
---  
  
"...There's blood."  
  
There's a small trace of blood on the floor, as if someone coughed up blood here.  
  
―――I get an intuition.  
  
Sakura was here a while ago.  
  
Sakura was in the living room, waiting for my return.  
  
---  
  
Traces of an intruder. Traces of blood.  
  
The absence of Sakura, who should be sleeping sick.  
  
---  
  
That's all.  
  
It's more strange not to draw a conclusion.  
  
The answer is clear if I think about it just a bit.  
  
Calmly.  
  
Calmly.  
  
Calmly.  
  
Calmly think, and I can tell what happened here.  
  
---  
  
So, why――――  
  
"―――――――"  
  
Why is my head not working at all?  
  
---  
  
I should've come home earlier.  
  
I should've thought about it more seriously.  
  
Didn't I have Sakura stay over for fear that something like this would happen?  
  
---  
  
Matou Zouken said Sakura is unrelated.  
  
Why did I believe his words?  
  
There's no way she's unrelated when she's part of the Matou family.  
  
---  
  
So why?  
  
Why did I believe such a convenient story――――!?  
  
---  
  
"―――――"  
  
The phone rings.  
  
My head blank, I pick up the phone with mechanical movements.  
  
---  
  
"Hello? Are you finally home, Emiya?"  
  
---  
  
The cheerful voice is that of Matou Shinji.  
  
---  
  
"――――What did you do with Sakura?"  
  
"Huh? Oh, I called you because I thought you'd be sad about Sakura not being there, but it seems you're more perceptive than that. That's amazing. You know what's going on before I've told you anything."  
  
---  
  
"Shut up. What did you do to Sakura?"  
  
"Huh? I only took back what's mine. I can't leave her at someone else's house forever."  
  
---  
  
"Shinji."  
  
"Haha! That's great, you're getting pissed! You're vexed that I took Sakura!"  
  
---  
  
Vexed...?  
  
No way. I don't have such extra emotion.  
  
---  
  
"Don't waste my time. Just tell me what your business is."  
  
"Heh―――you should know. Let's decide our match. You don't think that previous fight was the end, right?"  
  
---  
  
"I do. You ran away. Everything was decided right then."  
  
---  
  
"It's not decided...! That's the difference in our Servants, not your power! I wouldn't have run away if Saber wasn't there! There's no way I'll lose if Saber doesn't come...!"  
  
---  
  
If Saber doesn't come...?  
  
...I see. Rider must not have told Shinji that Saber was eliminated.  
  
I don't know what Rider is thinking, but Shinji still thinks I'm a Master.  
  
Oh―――that must be why he kidnapped Sakura.  
  
In short, this phone call is to...  
  
---  
  
"Shinji. What are you going to do with Sakura?"  
  
"Nothing. But that would depend on what you do.  
  
I won't do anything to Sakura if you come alone. You know what that means, right?"  
  
---  
  
"Yeah. You want me to fight you without Saber, right?"  
  
---  
  
"Wow, you're pretty bright today. Look, we'll fight at school. I'll give Sakura back to you if you come alone.  
  
...Oh, but don't try to pull any shit with me. Rider set up a boundary field over the school. I'll know right away if you bring Saber along.  
  
If that happens―――I can't guarantee what'll happen to her."  
  
---  
  
"Ow...!"  
  
I hear a sound of him kicking something.  
  
---  
  
"I'll go right away. Don't do anything else to Sakura."  
  
"Hah...! Fine, I'll take that exchange.  
  
But still, didn't you take your time coming home?  
  
You say not to do anything else to Sakura, but even I can't think of any other things to do to her that I haven't already tried."  
  
---  
  
"―――What did you do to Sakura, Shinji?"  
  
"Who knows? I got bored with punching her, so I gave her to Rider. It's just like that night. Rider bit Sakura's neck and――――"  
  
---  
  
I smack down the receiver.  
  
"You did it, Shinji."  
  
I can still hear his laugh.  
  
I set off for school, my nerves blazing with anger.  
  
---  
  
I go outside.  
  
The sky is dark, and the sun's about to set.  
  
I bet it'll rain tonight.  
  
I have to come home with Sakura before that.  
  
---  
  
The school building is deserted.  
  
Thanks to the series of comas, the school closed early.  
  
It's past five o'clock, and there are no students or teachers at the school now.  
  
---  
  
――――There's hot steel in my back.  
  
The Magic Circuit is already made.  
  
I concentrate so that I can use my only weapon whenever necessary.  
  
---  
  
――――It must be Rider's boundary field.  
  
The school's tinted red, and my lungs are damaged every time I breathe.  
  
I cough up blood.  
  
But I ignore it and run up the stairs.  
  
---  
  
I'm not certain, but I can still guess.  
  
Considering Shinji, he wouldn't position himself on unfamiliar territory.  
  
He has to be in the classroom on the third floor.  
  
---  
  
I get up to the third floor.  
  
The red filter condenses, scraping off my magical energy with each step I take.  
  
---  
  
Was he waiting for me?  
  
Shinji is watching me from the entrance of room 2-C.  
  
---  
  
"――――Shinji...!"  
  
"Hah―――so honest, Emiya. You came, just like you promised...!"  
  
---  
  
My brain boils up.  
  
―――Sakura must be in the classroom.  
  
I have to check if she's all right.  
  
If Shinji would get in my way, I would mercilessly...  
  
---  
  
"It's your turn, Rider! It's the Master of the one who defeated you...! Repay him for that insult...!"  
  
The black Servant stands in my way.  
  
―――I don't care.  
  
I can't stop, no matter who may be in front of me.  
  
---  
  
―――The dagger is swung.  
  
I read its course with amazing speed and avoid it.  
  
Having dodged the dagger, I pass by Rider next.  
  
It must be because of her tall figure and her long hair, but Rider cannot seize me as I rush past.  
  
---  
  
―――Got him.  
  
The distance is about five meters. I close in on Shinji in under two seconds, aim at the Command Spell controlling Rider, and...  
  
".........!!!!?"  
  
My tongue bulges from my mouth.  
  
Something squeezes my neck from behind.  
  
---  
  
"――――Phew. What are you doing, Rider!? You call yourself a Servant, letting Emiya do things like this!?"  
  
"......I am sorry. I took his concentration lightly."  
  
---  
  
―――I hear Rider's voice from right behind me.  
  
"Guh... kuh, ah...!"  
  
My feet don't reach the ground.  
  
Rider has wrapped a chain about my neck and lifted my body off the floor.――――  
  
---  
  
"Ha――――gah, guh......!"  
  
Suspended in the air like this, I can't do anything to resist.  
  
Rider is out of sight behind me, and my neck is already―――  
  
---  
  
"You lost because you lost your composure, Saber's Master.  
  
I cannot entrust Sakura to you. ...Though it is not my will, you must die here."  
  
"Guh――――, ......"  
  
---  
  
...My consciousness fades away.  
  
A bit more.  
  
It's only a bit more, but my body is suspended in midair...  
  
---  
  
...And I hear the sound of my neck breaking.  
  
---  
  
## Scene 07 Tiger Dojo 28  
  
  
  
Hi, is everyone doing well?  
  
This is the Tiger Dojo, the place to save those who fought hard in vain and died!  
  
---  
  
...Wait, the ground's shaking...  
  
---  
  
We have taken over Tiger Dojo!  
  
Disarm yourself, Taiga!  
  
---  
  
That voice, former pupil number one...!?  
  
Hey, what's going――――whaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?  
  
---  
  
Tiger!  
  
Look, Taiga! This is our secret weapon!  
  
---  
  
Ready, target the Tiger Dojo!  
  
Gunner, fire!  
  
---  
  
CHEEEEEEEEEEEST!!!!!  
  
---  
  
......Huh?  
  
---  
  
Kyaaaaaaaaaa!???  
  
---  
  
Tiger! The Tiger I got from the former ** army has been destroyed in one blow!?  
  
---  
  
Yes! I'm surprised as well!  
  
By the way, Private First Class Illya! I was really surprised that you came with a tank!  
  
---  
  
Oh... Teehee. I overdid it trying to surprise you. Am I full of fun?  
  
---  
  
I'll kill you!  
  
---  
  
Osu, thank you (cry).  
  
---  
  
It's fine if you understand.  
  
---  
  
I'd usually pull this joke a bit more, but it's getting tiresome, so I'll let you become my pupil again!  
  
---  
  
Eh, really, master?  
  
---  
  
Yup, really. There are twelve more Tiger Dojos.  
  
I can't handle them all by myself.  
  
---  
  
Actually, I don't know what you'll come attacking with next if I let you loose.  
  
---  
  
All right! Regular role get!  
  
But twelve more? Isn't that a lot? Does Shirou get killed by ▊▊▊ that many times?  
  
---  
  
Yeah, he will.  
  
---  
  
The chance of Shirou's death is highest in this route.  
  
And it's in bad taste too. In contrast to the splatter-like deaths you cause, this route is more horrifying.  
  
---  
  
Wow. The one's character is displayed.  
  
---  
  
Yeah. So you be careful in your choices, okay, Shirou?  
  
This dead end is, um... it's because you tried to fight by yourself even though Saber-chan's gone.  
  
---  
  
That's no good, Shirou. Your opponents are all monsters, so you have to team up with a monster you can use as a shield.  
  
---  
  
I know you don't want to, but go back to the choice and ask Rin.  
  
---  
  
And be careful with the choice after that. I don't know about a man doing everything he is told to do.  
  
---  
  
That's exactly right, master! Be able to say no!  
  
---  
  
Shirou with great determination!  
  
---  
  
That's right.  
  
---  
  
Then let's meet again in the next Tiger Dojo!  
  
The 9th day has four Tiger Dojos, so be careful in your choices!  
  
---  
  
See ya!  
  
---  
  
## Scene 08 Rin's question Choice  
  
  
  
――――I have to decide what to do from now on.  
  
---  
  
I chose to keep fighting.  
  
Matou Zouken and Assassin.  
  
The black shadow wandering around the town.  
  
The battle between Masters over the Holy Grail.  
  
I chose to stop it even without Saber.  
  
Then it shouldn't matter how I do it.  
  
I need Tohsaka's help if I don't want there to be any more victims.  
  
---  
  
"―――Tohsaka.  
  
I lost Saber and my Command Spell. So I'm not a Master anymore, right?"  
  
---  
  
"...Right. I forgot about that. You're not a Master anymore. You have no reason to be involved in the Holy Grail War, and you're less likely to be attacked by other Masters."  
  
---  
  
"Yeah. I only wanted the Holy Grail because Saber wanted it. ...I have no interest in it now that Saber's gone."  
  
"I see. Then you're not going to be fighting anymore?"  
  
---  
  
There's no emotion in Tohsaka's eyes.  
  
Her words are merely something she must ask as a Master, devoid of personal interest.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
This is not a question, but a warning.  
  
This is my last chance.  
  
She's providing me with a chance to back out, telling me I'll still make it if I want to withdraw.  
  
---  
  
"――――――I will fight."  
  
But my mind is made up.  
  
I'll remember her consideration, though.  
  
---  
  
"I will fight. I won't stop fighting just because I'm not a Master. I chose to fight to stop the war."  
  
"―――I see. Then I guess we'll still keep our relationship.  
  
Even though we're enemies, we'll keep our truce in place until the shadow has been beaten."  
  
---  
  
"...?"  
  
Tohsaka suddenly smiles.  
  
She looks friendly, as if something good has happened.  
  
Well, I don't care, but――――  
  
---  
  
"―――Hold on. Why are we enemies?  
  
I'm not a Master anymore. There's no reason for us to fight."  
  
---  
  
"What are you saying? Even if you've lost your Command Spell and your Servant, you're still Saber's former Master.  
  
You were somehow chosen by the Holy Grail, so you have the right to obtain the Holy Grail until the very end. You're still my rival even though you're powerless."  
  
---  
  
"Really? Even if I have no intention of obtaining the Holy Grail?"  
  
---  
  
"That would depend on the situation, right? It's possible that you end up needing the Holy Grail when you're in a situation where you can obtain it, and you inevitably use it.  
  
Unselfish people are affected by other people because they are unselfish."  
  
---  
  
"Hm. You're thinking too much, Tohsaka. Even if I end up needing the Holy Grail, that doesn't mean I can obtain it."  
  
---  
  
"It's just a what-if. But the possibility is there.  
  
That's why I'm saying we're enemies, and that's why magi that aren't Masters anymore run to the church.  
  
Even without their Servants, they're still obstacles to the other Masters. Keep that in mind and watch out. It's not just Zouken that wants to kill you."  
  
---  
  
"Hm...... I appreciate the warning, but..."  
  
Um, I don't like having Tohsaka as an enemy.  
  
---  
  
"...? Why the difficult face? We're already enemies. Is there a problem with that?"  
  
"Yeah. This means I can't ask for your help after all."  
  
---  
  
"Huh?"  
  
She freezes.  
  
She looks at me as if she's seen a ghost.  
  
---  
  
"Why do you need my help...?"  
  
---  
  
"Because I can't do this by myself. Ending the Holy Grail War means defeating the other Masters, but I don't have the power to do so."  
  
---  
  
"...I know it looks pitiful, but I don't care about that. I only have a few options, and I think this is the best thing I can do.  
  
That's why I can't be enemies with you.  
  
―――I need you as an ally."  
  
---  
  
"...Hey. Are you sane, Emiya-kun?"  
  
"I am. I'm too weak to fight alongside you, so I could end up weighing you down.  
  
I can't offer you anything in return, so there's nothing in it for you if you help me.  
  
...Yeah, cooperation like this isn't usually possible."  
  
---  
  
"H-Heh. So you do understand.  
  
Equivalent exchange is standard for magi, just like you say. I can't lend something to someone with no money, and I can't help someone who can't help me in return. You know that's for your own good too, right?"  
  
---  
  
"I gave you advice because we had a truce, but it's a different matter if we're actually allies. If that were the case, we'd have to share the reward too."  
  
---  
  
"I know. But I'm asking you anyway, even knowing that.  
  
―――Please help me, Tohsaka. I'll pay you back for this as long as I'm alive."  
  
---  
  
"As long as you're alive――――?"  
  
Tohsaka looks away and mutters.  
  
---  
  
...I'm fully aware that I'm only a burden on her.  
  
But Tohsaka is the most reliable person I know, and I can trust her to do no wrong even if she obtains the Holy Grail.  
  
So Tohsaka is the only one I can see winning, and the only one I'm willing to cooperate with.  
  
---  
  
"Tohsaka. Let me hear your answer."  
  
I look at her straight on.  
  
"...I-It's obvious, right? Even if I team up with someone who's not a Master, I..."  
  
---  
  
"Tohsaka."  
  
"I said I can't help you even if you ask me like that. First of all..."  
  
---  
  
"Tohsaka."  
  
"...This is like a real contract."  
  
---  
  
Then.  
  
Tohsaka looks down once, and...  
  
---  
  
"―――Geez, all right! Then here are the terms for our agreement!"  
  
She glares at me.  
  
---  
  
"...? What do you mean by terms?"  
  
"Terms are terms!  
  
...Um, this is a legitimate contract.  
  
So I'll consider it if you can promise me what I'm going to ask you."  
  
---  
  
"...??? Tohsaka. I've already told you, I have nothing I can give back to you."  
  
"Just listen to me!"  
  
"......! A-All right, I'll listen."  
  
---  
  
"Okay. Here's the first one. I don't mind cooperating, but will you do as I tell you?  
  
Will you obey me, no matter what I tell you to do, during a battle?"  
  
---  
  
## Scene 09 Who do you think you are?  
  
  
  
"No. I probably can't obey you unconditionally."  
  
"...Hey now. Who do you think you are, answering like that from the very first question?"  
  
"But isn't it normal? For example, I'd be in trouble if you give me a reckless order."  
  
---  
  
"I won't be that stupid. If you think it's reckless, it's probably because you don't understand what I'm planning.  
  
...Oh well. So you'll obey me, as long as the order's reasonable?"  
  
"Yeah, I can keep that promise."  
  
---  
  
## Scene 10 Can you trust her? Can you stay on her side?  
  
  
  
"Then here's the second question. Can you trust me like I'll be trusting you? Will you stay on my side, no matter how ugly things get?"  
  
---  
  
## Scene 11 Who do you think you are?  
  
  
  
"Hm... I won't betray you, of course, but I'm not sure about the last part.  
  
What do you mean by things turning out ugly?"  
  
---  
  
"That's obvious, right? I'm talking about dying or coming close to it. You have nothing to give me, so you need to be prepared for such a thing, right?  
  
Or what? Are you saying I should conveniently give you whatever you ask with nothing in return?"  
  
---  
  
"Uh, guh. You've got me, Tohsaka."  
  
"Of course. I'm not playing around right now. It's not worth it for me unless you show that much determination."  
  
"...Okay. I'll try my best."  
  
---  
  
## Scene 12 Will you give me your absolute obedience?  
  
  
  
"I see. So you will give me your absolute obedience?"  
  
---  
  
"――――Mm."  
  
Tohsaka says something dangerous with an evil smile.  
  
That seems to be the final question, but――――  
  
---  
  
## Scene 13 Let me win  
  
  
  
"――――No way...! I'll admit that your instructions are better as a magus. But I'm sure you make mistakes once in a while.  
  
If you say something ridiculous, I can't just obey you. I'll protest if I think you're wrong. That's what it means to cooperate, right?"  
  
---  
  
"Of course. I can't cooperate with you unless that's the case.  
  
I tend to do things my own way, so I need someone to act as my brakes.  
  
It'll be helpful if you can take that role."  
  
---  
  
"Huh――――――――?"  
  
...I'm a bit disappointed.  
  
I expected disagreeing to spark an argument, but Tohsaka is nodding in satisfaction.  
  
---  
  
"Then here's the last question.  
  
I'll help you as much as I can if it's something I can do and you can't do.  
  
But... can you do the same even in the opposite case?"  
  
---  
  
"...? Something I can do that you can't do...?"  
  
Is there such a thing?  
  
Is it possible that she can't cook and needs my help?  
  
---  
  
"Hey. Come on and answer since this is the most important question. Yes or no. Quick."  
  
"...Well. Um, it'll help me out if you can give me a specific example..."  
  
---  
  
"Geez...! I'm asking if you'll let me win or not!"  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
She says with her cheeks blushing, as if she's sulking.  
  
It looks childish, completely unlike Tohsaka.  
  
---  
  
But――――  
  
"......Yeah.  
  
I'll let you win since I'm cooperating with you. I promise."  
  
...It's actually really cute.  
  
---  
  
"Then we'll meet at the front gate after school.  
  
You're going to have club activities at my place, starting today."  
  
"Hm――――club activities at your place?"  
  
---  
  
"Yup. We're cooperating, so I need to teach you how to fight by yourself, right?  
  
...Well, I know from what I've already seen that you're an amateur, so you'll be working overtime every day."  
  
---  
  
"Well, I don't mind, and that's actually helpful―――  
  
But is that starting today?"  
  
---  
  
"Of course. I have to figure out your ability and determine our plan from tonight on.  
  
You'll be going home late, but it's no problem since you live alone, right?"  
  
"Huh? Well, that's true, but how do you know that, Tohsaka?"  
  
---  
  
"...! I-I thought so because there wasn't anyone at your house when I treated your wound before.  
  
A-Anyway, that's how it's going to be, so you just have to wait for me at the front gate!"  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
Tohsaka waves goodbye and runs off.  
  
It's Friday today... Classes run to sixth period, so we'll be going home after three o'clock.  
  
---  
  
"...This is bad. I told Sakura I'd be coming home early, but I can't cancel Tohsaka's proposal on the very first day."  
  
I feel bad for Sakura, but I'll go with Tohsaka for today.  
  
---  
  
...Well, she isn't a devil.  
  
So she might let me go home early today if I tell her about Sakura.... Right?  
  
---  
  
## Scene 14 Geas  
  
  
  
"...I have a bad feeling, but it can't be helped if that's the condition of our exchange. I'll do as you say."  
  
I agree with heartrending grief.  
  
---  
  
...Then.  
  
Tohsaka looks displeased.  
  
---  
  
"What's wrong, Tohsaka? Was my answer not good?"  
  
"It's nothing. It was an ideal answer. I'm not satisfied, but if that's what you say, that's how it'll be.  
  
Then accept my magecraft, Emiya-kun. I'm going to make those words real."  
  
---  
  
"Huh... make the words real...?"  
  
"I'm going to put a geas on you. It's not something I can use readily since it's one of the worst curses around.  
  
But I can lock it if you accept it."  
  
---  
  
"A curse of coercion... Is it like the Command Spell for a Servant?"  
  
"Yes, but it's not almighty.  
  
Binding you would be the most it can do, and I can't force you to do anything that has to do with your life. It'll be effective for the duration of the Holy Grail War. That's fine, right?"  
  
---  
  
"Oh... Yeah, that's fine."  
  
"Then close your eyes. Don't move your body or your Magic Circuit."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
...I do as I'm told.  
  
"―――Satz.  
  
Beklagter, meine W[ouml]rter, werden geglaubt.  
  
Wei[szlig] ist schwarz.  
  
Richtige [uuml]bliche Peitsche.  
  
Die Vergeltung vom Himmel."  
  
---  
  
―――Fire lights up in my core.  
  
Tohsaka's verse coils about my nerves, insinuating itself into my body and mind.  
  
---  
  
A sound as if a small bottle is shaking.  
  
Right next to my heart...  
  
Another heart is created――――  
  
---  
  
―――The bell rings, indicating the end of lunch.  
  
I don't know how deep a trance Tohsaka's magecraft put me into, but I've missed the rest of our break.  
  
---  
  
"It's done. Our contract is complete."  
  
---  
  
"Now, let's meet at the front gate after school.  
  
You're going to have club activities at my place, starting today."  
  
"Hm――――club activities at your place?"  
  
---  
  
"Yup. We're cooperating, so I need to teach you how to fight by yourself, right?  
  
...Well, I know from what I've already seen that you're an amateur, so you'll be working overtime every day."  
  
---  
  
"Well, I don't mind, and that's actually helpful―――  
  
But is that starting today?"  
  
---  
  
"Of course. I have to figure out your ability and determine our plan from tonight on.  
  
You'll be going home late, but since you live alone that's not a problem, right?"  
  
"Huh? Well, that's true, but how do you know that, Tohsaka?"  
  
---  
  
"...! I-I thought so because there wasn't anyone at your house when I treated your wound before.  
  
A-Anyway, that's how it's going to be, so you just have to wait for me at the front gate!"  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
Tohsaka waves goodbye and runs off.  
  
It's Friday today... Classes run to sixth period, so we'll be going home after three o'clock.  
  
---  
  
"...This is bad. I told Sakura I'd be coming home early, but I can't cancel Tohsaka's proposal on the very first day."  
  
I feel bad for Sakura, but I'll go with Tohsaka for today.  
  
---  
  
...Well, she isn't a devil.  
  
So she might let me go home early today if I tell her about Sakura.... Right?  
  
---  
  
## Scene 15 Photo  
  
  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I wait for Tohsaka by the front gate.  
  
The sky is gray, and it looks like it'll rain any minute now.  
  
There's a chill wind, so it'll be a cold night if it rains.  
  
---  
  
"What are you thinking about?"  
  
―――Then.  
  
Tohsaka is in front of me when I notice.  
  
She must have ran here, as her shoulders are moving up and down.  
  
---  
  
"Nothing. I just thought it might rain."  
  
"Oh, the weather? I guess it'll just be a drizzle. We have to go patrol at night, so it'll be a pain if it rains too much."  
  
---  
  
...Hm.  
  
It seems Tohsaka has already made plans for us to go on patrol tonight.  
  
I don't mind, but I'd like to go by my house and check on Sakura before that.  
  
---  
  
"Tohsaka, about that..."  
  
"I know. I'll train you as your cooperator, so prepare yourself. I'll make you a proper magus."  
  
---  
  
With those confident words, Tohsaka sets off down the hill.  
  
...Crap.  
  
I can't bring up the subject of going home early if she smiles like that.  
  
---  
  
We make the long walk up the hill south of the intersection.  
  
This residential area is filled with Western-style houses.  
  
Tohsaka's house is at the top of this hill, past Sakura's.  
  
---  
  
"Wow――――"  
  
So this is Tohsaka's place.  
  
Sakura's house is bigger, but this house feels more like a Western mansion.  
  
---  
  
...And it somehow feels cold.  
  
There's been an air that seems to reject anyone nearing this place ever since we finished climbing up the hill.  
  
---  
  
"Why did you stop? This is my house."  
  
"Y―――Yeah, I know. I was just coerced."  
  
---  
  
"...Yeah. My house is different from yours. It's just that even someone who's ignorant of magical energy like you can feel the coldness of this house."  
  
Tohsaka goes into her home, speaking in bored tones.  
  
---  
  
"Hey, come on. I don't have any traps set up, so you don't need to hesitate."  
  
She beckons me from the entrance.  
  
---  
  
"......No. It's not because of the atmosphere that I'm hesitating."  
  
Muttering to myself, I gather my composure and go in.  
  
---  
  
...This place certainly does have a cold atmosphere, but that's nothing.  
  
She has no idea what a big deal it is for a guy to come over to Tohsaka Rin's house.  
  
...Well, I'm sure she won't understand even if I explain it to her. If I'm lucky, she'll just laugh.  
  
---  
  
――――Wait.  
  
---  
  
"W-Why are we in your room and not the living room!"  
  
---  
  
With an utter lack of concern, she shows me through the living room and into her bedroom.  
  
---  
  
"It's because this place has more instruments ready.  
  
The living room is where you have tea, but we didn't come here to drink tea, right?"  
  
"Uh――――um. You're... right, but..."  
  
Um, I wish she'd think of me as a boy her age.  
  
---  
  
"...? Just sit down wherever. I'll be using sage and cards to consecrate you, but tell me now if you don't like either."  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka opens the box by her bed.  
  
It looks like a treasure chest from an adventure movie.  
  
---  
  
"Hmm... Kishua's agate is useless for this. ...Oh, I'm out of sage. Can you bring some up from downstairs, Archer?"  
  
"Scarlet sage, right? ...Well, I don't think you'll need to go that far to distinguish this man."  
  
---  
  
"I'll do whatever I please. You can rest downstairs after that. We have a pact, so you don't need to protect me."  
  
"―――You're right. I doubt he has the nerve to betray you. I shall get ready for tonight."  
  
---  
  
That must be Archer.  
  
His presence must be thin when in spirit form. I didn't feel much magical energy from him.  
  
---  
  
"...I'm surprised. I didn't notice that he was in the room."  
  
"That's how it is if he's in spirit form.  
  
Even if he takes form, his magical energy won't leak outside as long as he's in this house. It's elementary for a workshop to shut in the magical energy."  
  
---  
  
"Oh. So is it the same for Makiri... no, Matou's place?"  
  
"Yes. But that place has no need to hide magical energy anymore. If they are hiding magical energy, it'd be the energy leaking out from the magus himself and not from the house."  
  
---  
  
"Well, either way, it takes nothing to hide magical energy. I'd take Archer with me to school too, but I'm resting him during the day since he's not up to par."  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka rummages through the treasure chest with a difficult expression.  
  
...It seems she can't find what she wants. Is she the kind of person that never keeps anything in order?  
  
---  
  
"...Really, why doesn't the wound he received from Saber heal when all other wounds can be healed easily? I'm sure they had some connection... Geez, why am I finding my master's jewels now? I can never find them when I want them, dammit!"  
  
---  
  
She leans forward and keeps fumbling around.  
  
...That chest looks small, but it seems big enough to be able to fit Tohsaka inside.  
  
---  
  
"――――Man."  
  
There's nothing to prepare for.  
  
All I can do is pray that she'll find the thing she wants, or just look around her room aimlessly――――  
  
---  
  
"......?"  
  
Then.  
  
I see something.  
  
---  
  
―――It's a photo.  
  
A bookshelf that's about waist-high is at the corner of the room.  
  
On it is a photo that looks to have been forgotten.  
  
Dust falls off of it when I pick it up, and I can tell it has been left alone for a long time  
  
---  
  
"...It's not that she never cleans. Just this picture is undisturbed."  
  
Does Tohsaka not like seeing herself as a kid?  
  
...No, if that were all, she could just put it away. Maybe it's important to her, but she doesn't want to touch it...  
  
---  
  
"......But..."  
  
People sure can change.  
  
Tohsaka looks like she's five or six years old, and she's really cute in the picture.  
  
---  
  
"...So she had long hair back then, too.... Huh?"  
  
The girl in the picture looks just like she is now, except younger.  
  
That's why I notice the one thing that's different.  
  
---  
  
"Thanks for waiting, I'm all ready now. There'll be a little pain, but it's nothing you should be worried about... Huh, what's going on, Emiya-kun?"  
  
---  
  
"Oh. This, Tohsaka."  
  
I show her the picture I found.  
  
---  
  
"Oh, that's an old photo. I just put that in the corner, but is something wrong with it?"  
  
"Huh... Well, there's nothing wrong, but..."  
  
---  
  
It's nothing much, so I hesitate.  
  
It's nothing I need to ask about, but it just caught my attention.  
  
---  
  
"Oh. I see, you want to say I have a different ribbon on, right?"  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I nod.  
  
---  
  
"That's natural. I'm a girl, so I have lots of ribbons. Even if it's my favorite, do you think I'd keep the same ribbon for over ten years?"  
  
---  
  
Oh.  
  
She's right now that she mentions it.  
  
It's just an ordinary ribbon. Why was I so concerned about it?  
  
---  
  
"I'm kidding. That's what I want to say, but ribbons are special. It's the last resort for female magi. It's an appropriate magical item, so there aren't many substitutes for it."  
  
"...Wow. Then is that ribbon some sort of a magical item?"  
  
---  
  
"Yes. Holding the hair in place means holding the magical energy in place. My family doesn't have mystic eyes, so we have to at least keep our reserve magical energy from our hair.  
  
It's something that controls your body, so it's best if you make it yourself, right?"  
  
---  
  
"That's the first ribbon I made. It was my favorite, but I parted with it for various reasons.  
  
...Well, let's stop with the idle talk. I'm starting the consecration, so sit down in that chair―――"  
  
---  
  
## Scene 16 Afternoon-Return home Rin-sama gets angry  
  
  
  
Tohsaka's analysis ends rather quickly.  
  
She lit an incense, did something like tarot fortune-telling, and asked me a few personality assessment-like questions.  
  
---  
  
And Tohsaka says...  
  
"―――You don't correspond to anything. Further analysis would be useless."  
  
...And quickly gives up diagnosing my Magic Circuit.  
  
---  
  
"Hey. Does that mean you can't tell?"  
  
And when I ask her...  
  
---  
  
"Excuse me. I found out that you're not related to the five elements. Any more consecration is out of my expertise, so it's useless to keep going.  
  
I'll just see what magecraft you can use and figure out from there."  
  
---  
  
...That's how it is according to her.  
  
I run through the "strengthening" magecraft using the clay she prepared.  
  
---  
  
It's called an ether cluster, and it's a strange object that returns to its original form no matter what happens to it. It's a good conductor of magical energy.  
  
I strengthen it so easily that I'm afraid it won't recover, but...  
  
---  
  
"It's like shiniku, so don't worry about it. It restores its original state in a day even if you bundle it with strong magical energy."  
  
...She says something like that.  
  
Shiniku, by the way, is meat that never goes away, no matter how much of it you eat.  
  
---  
  
...Anyway, I keep repeating the strengthening magecraft on the clay.  
  
I can't fail in front of Tohsaka, but I only succeed two out of ten times.  
  
Activating my Magic Circuit, which was easy when I had Saber, took a lot of time and effort.  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka asks me a few questions while I cast the strengthening magecraft.  
  
Whether I'm self-taught, whether I can use any other spells, how Kiritsugu taught me, and what I have the easiest time imagining.  
  
---  
  
So.  
  
Tohsaka's expression darkens further with each answer I give, and by the end she's shut up entirely.  
  
I don't know what she's angry about, but it's really awkward to be here if she makes a face like that.  
  
---  
  
"Tohsaka? ...Um, I know it's only a matter of course, but are you regretting cooperating with me because I'm such an amateur?"  
  
I ask her the most likely thing.  
  
---  
  
"Huh...? Yeah, I do regret that you're an amateur, but in your case, you were taught wrong... Or should I say that I'm surprised you're still alive with the way you're doing things."  
  
Tohsaka ponders.  
  
---  
  
"...? Heeey, Tohsaka? You lost me."  
  
".........?"  
  
Why is she glaring at me?  
  
---  
  
"......Fine. I guess if I'm going to correct you, we'll have to start with the fundamentals. But let's go back to what we were talking about earlier. Is it true that the things you projected are still in your shed?"  
  
"Yeah. Things don't normally go away unless you break them, right?"  
  
---  
  
I told her that I use projection as a breather in between strengthening magecraft.  
  
It seems Tohsaka is particular about it, and told me to use projection using the clay.  
  
She told me to make a vase. Everything started out smoothly, but in the end I still failed.  
  
---  
  
"―――Hmph. For now, I'll teach you how to turn your switch on and off.  
  
It's faster to make an actual switch in your body. Stay over tonight. It's a drastic measure, so you'll have to stay in bed all night."  
  
---  
  
"What――――? You mean here?"  
  
"What's with that face? Don't worry. I'm not going to be performing surgery on you. You'll just drink some medicine. Well, you won't be able to move for a while because it's so strong."  
  
---  
  
"Oh... Um, it's not that I don't like drastic measures..."  
  
...I look at the clock.  
  
It's almost five.  
  
I didn't notice since it's cloudy today, but it's getting late.  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka is helping me as a fellow magus.  
  
I'm worried about leaving Sakura alone in her condition, but today's an exception.  
  
...Tohsaka's cooperating with me, so she takes precedence.  
  
---  
  
"...Hey, why the painful look?  
  
You don't mind taking drastic measures, right? Then just give up and accept it."  
  
---  
  
"...Yeah, I will. But let me make sure, Tohsaka. This thing will end today, right? I'll really be in trouble if I can't move tomorrow."  
  
---  
  
"...Well. I can't deny that possibility, to be honest. I can't tell how it'll turn out, and it'll take longer if your body has matured to the point where it can't be tampered with. And there's the possibility of the operation itself failing.  
  
Well, that's all up to your luck. How's your luck recently, Emiya-kun?"  
  
---  
  
...It's bad.  
  
It's worse still given that the one asking me holds my fate in her hands.  
  
---  
  
"...Hold on. That's really troublesome.  
  
I have to go home by tomorrow."  
  
"Huh? Your home?"  
  
---  
  
"Yeah. Sakura's lying sick at my house, so I want to go check on her. I won't be able to rest easy while I'm lying in bed unless I'm sure she's all right."  
  
---  
  
"Crap―――I forgot about it."  
  
...She's astonished.  
  
Tohsaka stares at me, bewildered, and...  
  
"You idiot! I wouldn't have kept you here for so long if you'd told me earlier...!"  
  
...As if trying to get back at me, she gives an unexpected response.  
  
---  
  
"We can talk about the switch later! We can do that at your house!"  
  
"W-What...!?"  
  
She yells at me as she crosses the room and puts on her coat.  
  
---  
  
"Let's go. We're done with what we have to do here, and we can do the rest at your place. We'll continue as soon as you're done with nursing Sakura, so let's hurry."  
  
"Eh――――o-okay. That'll help me out."  
  
---  
  
"...Humph. I'll tell you now since I don't want to have to keep remembering this.  
  
―――Your nature is in projection and not strengthening.  
  
I don't know where you made your mistake or what your misunderstanding is, but you're a magus that belongs on the 'side that creates'."  
  
Tohsaka walks off down the hallway.  
  
---  
  
"...?"  
  
I tilt my head in wonder, but I follow Tohsaka and leave the Tohsaka household.  
  
---

## Scene 20 Over  
  
  
  
The second hand on the clock ticks loudly, causing her to look up.  
  
It's past four o'clock.  
  
School's already over and he should be home by now even if he went by the shopping district.  
  
---  
  
"...I wonder what's going on. Senpai sure is late."  
  
She leans on the wall and murmurs absent-mindedly.  
  
---  
  
"――――Huh?"  
  
She feels heavy and dizzy.  
  
She's surprised at how quiet her voice is.  
  
The second hand is annoyingly loud, but her words are almost inaudible.  
  
Only simple sounds echo in her ears.  
  
The monotonous ticking of the clock,  
  
and the painful thumping of her heart.  
  
The two sounds enter her brain even if she covers her ears, and her dizziness gets worse.  
  
---  
  
"That's strange... I'm really not sick anymore."  
  
That's why she sent the housekeeper home.  
  
She was down to her normal temperature when she checked it, and she was able to cook her own lunch.  
  
She was just fine after lunch, and she waited eagerly for his return.  
  
---  
  
"――――It's hot――――"  
  
But her whole body is hot now.  
  
The heat source isn't her, so it has to be something else.  
  
Between her blood vessels. Between her muscles where there are no spaces.  
  
Something that's not her is in there, turning like a car engine.  
  
―――Her fever is so high that it makes her imagine such a thing, and the abnormality is unprecedented.  
  
---  
  
The sensation is strange and unpleasant.  
  
She isn't the only one that's in pain.  
  
It's shared by the things in her body, crawling through her blood vessels and nerves.  
  
To speak figuratively, it's like a dog looking for the exit to a can filled with meat.  
  
The heat source, the things within her, are trying their best to fulfill their role.  
  
Thinking about that makes them seem charming, and she cannot make herself hate the sensation.  
  
---  
  
"...The clock's loud..."  
  
She looks up at the clock absent-mindedly.  
  
It's four-thirty.  
  
A bit longer. He should be back in half an hour.  
  
She has to calm down and suppress the things running around inside of her by then.  
  
---  
  
"...It's fine... It's happened many times before..."  
  
Yes, she is used to this.  
  
She has been disciplined and reformed many times since she was a child.  
  
She tells herself that it will be no trouble this time either―――but her fever does not go down, and the things within her keep speeding up.  
  
---  
  
"...No... This is strange, Senpai."  
  
Her body does not calm down.  
  
She has never been able to.  
  
What's missing, what she needs, and what has changed.  
  
She tries hard to think about these questions, but the ticking of the clock keeps distracting her.  
  
---  
  
"――――Huh...? This sound..."  
  
When she realizes the sound is not the clock, but a warning from the house itself...  
  
"Oh, Emiya's not here? That's convenient."  
  
A familiar person enters, barefooted.  
  
---  
  
"Nii-san."  
  
"Huh? Oh, Emiya's not here and you're getting all hot and horny by yourself? Did I use Rider too much, like the old man said?"  
  
He comes into the living room and walks over to the girl leaning against the wall.  
  
---  
  
"Oh――――"  
  
She tries to run, but can't muster the strength.  
  
No, she had no will to run away from the start.  
  
Even if she gets away―――she can never truly escape.  
  
---  
  
"This is your last order, Sakura. You said you'd do anything, right?"  
  
The one looking down at her is smiling.  
  
"――――Nii-san."  
  
"Let's go. I have to settle my match with Emiya. I'm sure you want to see him cry, so I'll let you see it up close."  
  
The boy grabs her arm and hauls her to her feet.  
  
---  
  
"No――――I don't want to...!"  
  
She tries to get away, but lacks the strength to do so.  
  
The man pulls her in and grabs her neck.  
  
---  
  
"Don't disobey me so much, Sakura. You're making me want to kill you. You just have to keep obeying me."  
  
"No――――it's not as you promised, Nii-san...! You said you wouldn't do anything to Senpai...!"  
  
She protests, her hair disheveled.  
  
He stops her with his foot.  
  
He has let go and kicked her stomach.  
  
---  
  
"Uh――――guh......"  
  
Collapsing to the ground, she lets out a moan.  
  
"I'm being kind. I have the medicine I got from the old man, but I'm not using it."  
  
He forces her to her feet.  
  
---  
  
"Ah... Ah, uh――――"  
  
He grabs hold of the coughing girl's neck once again.  
  
"Don't worry, I'll keep my promise. I won't tell him about what happened. But I won't be satisfied until he gets hurt."  
  
He puts his mouth close to her cheeks and whispers in delight.  
  
---  
  
"――――, Uh――――"  
  
With her neck held, she shuts her mouth in vexation.  
  
She tries to accept this turn of events, thinking that it always ends up this way.  
  
---  
  
"Yeah, that's right. Let's go ahead, Sakura. This is Emiya's territory. We have to be in my territory if we're going to play around. Rider, bring this woman with me."  
  
Giving her a violent shove, he exits.  
  
"――――Ri... der..."  
  
The girl raises her head.  
  
There stands a Servant with long hair.  
  
---  
  
"I'm home!"  
  
I raise my voice as I go into the house.  
  
"――――――――"  
  
...Then.  
  
I feel something strange as soon as I enter.  
  
---  
  
"The hallway, Emiya-kun."  
  
"――――――――"  
  
She doesn't even need to tell me.  
  
There are footprints on the floor.  
  
The only shoes I see are Sakura's.  
  
The housekeeper's aren't there, and the house is dead silent.  
  
---  
  
"Sakura."  
  
I go into the guest room.  
  
It's empty.  
  
The strange feeling turns into an ominous conviction.  
  
---  
  
I return to the living room.  
  
Sakura isn't here either.  
  
The footprints end here in the living room.  
  
Somebody came in here with his shoes on, did something in this room, and then went back outside.  
  
---  
  
"...Emiya-kun. Look at the floor there.  
  
It's small, but there's a trace of bl――――"  
  
"I know. Sakura was here."  
  
Yes, I know.  
  
Sakura was waiting for me alone in the living room, but is not here now.  
  
---  
  
There are unfamiliar footprints in the hallway.  
  
That's all.  
  
It's more strange not to draw a conclusion.  
  
The answer is clear if I think about it just a bit.  
  
---  
  
Calmly.  
  
Calmly.  
  
Calmly.  
  
Calmly think, and I can tell what happened here.  
  
So, why――――  
  
"――――――――!"  
  
Why is my head not working at all?  
  
---  
  
"H-Hey, Emiya-kun...!?"  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I should've come home earlier.  
  
I should've thought about it more seriously.  
  
Didn't I have Sakura stay over for fear of just this situation?  
  
Matou Zouken said Sakura is unrelated.  
  
Why did I believe his words?  
  
There's no way she's unrelated when she's part of the Matou family.  
  
---  
  
So why?  
  
Why did I believe such a convenient story――――!?  
  
---  
  
"―――――"  
  
The phone rings.  
  
I nod at Tohsaka and slowly pick up the receiver.  
  
---  
  
"Hello? Are you finally home, Emiya?"  
  
---  
  
It's Shinji.  
  
There's no mistake about it, and I knew this was what happened.  
  
---  
  
"What have you done with Sakura?"  
  
"Huh? I only took back what's mine. I can't leave her at someone else's house forever."  
  
---  
  
"Shinji."  
  
"Haha! That's great, you're getting pissed! You're vexed that I took Sakura!"  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka must be able to hear Shinji's voice, because she's leaning forward.  
  
I raise a hand to stop her and urge him to go on.  
  
---  
  
"Don't waste my time. Just tell me what your business is."  
  
"Heh―――you should know. Let's decide our match. You don't think that last fight was the end, do you?"  
  
"I do. You ran away. Everything was decided right then."  
  
---  
  
"It's not decided...! That's the difference in our Servants, not your power! I wouldn't have run away if Saber wasn't there! There's no way I'll lose if Saber doesn't come...!"  
  
---  
  
If Saber doesn't come...?  
  
...I see.  
  
Rider must not have told Shinji that Saber was eliminated.  
  
Oh―――that must be why he kidnapped Sakura.  
  
In short, this phone call is...  
  
---  
  
"Shinji. What are you going to do with Sakura?"  
  
"Nothing. But that would depend on what you do.  
  
I won't do anything to Sakura if you come alone. You know what that means, right?"  
  
"――――!"  
  
I stop Tohsaka.  
  
If she interrupts now, there's no telling what Shinji will do.  
  
---  
  
"So you want me to fight you without Saber?"  
  
"Yeah, I'm glad you're perceptive when it counts.  
  
―――We'll fight at school. Come alone, okay? Rider set up a boundary field over the school. I'll know right away if you bring Saber along.  
  
If that happens―――I can't guarantee what'll happen to her."  
  
---  
  
"Ow...!"  
  
I hear the sound of him kicking something.  
  
---  
  
"I'll go right away. But just in case, I want to know one thing. Are you a Master, or are you Sakura's brother?"  
  
"Hah...! Are you joking? Why would I be this shit's brother? Well, she's not completely useless because I can lure you out like this."  
  
---  
  
"――――All right.  
  
I'm going to go fight you as a Master."  
  
"Yeah, if it ends up being a fight."  
  
---  
  
I put the phone down.  
  
I start off right away.  
  
---  
  
"Hold on...!  
  
Are you really going to go alone!?"  
  
"That's what he wanted. We can talk later, Tohsaka."  
  
---  
  
"That's my line.  
  
Shinji has Sakura as a hostage.  
  
You'll be killed if you go. Seeing you die will be unbearable for Sakura. We should wait and see, and come up with a plan."  
  
---  
  
I know.  
  
But we don't have time.  
  
I can still hear her moans in my mind.  
  
---  
  
"――――I see. Would Shinji kill me in front of Sakura?"  
  
"Hm... I don't know, but that's highly possible since he's using Sakura as a hostage. ...Hey, are you all right, Emiya-kun? You look calm, but don't tell me you've actually lost your cool."  
  
---  
  
I've lost my cool?  
  
Is she asking me if I can only think about going to school and punching Shinji in the face?  
  
Oh, then――――  
  
---  
  
"Yeah. I can't think of anything else. I'm mad at myself for not saying anything because I thought it was a family matter.  
  
He said he's not her brother. ―――Such a guy took Sakura."  
  
---  
  
"He took her, so I'm going to go take her back. Don't do anything, Tohsaka."  
  
---  
  
I go outside.  
  
The sky is dark, and the sun's about to set.  
  
I bet it'll rain tonight.  
  
I have to come home with Sakura before that.  
  
---  
  
## Scene 21 VS Rider  
  
  
  
"Hold on...! Didn't you join forces with me because you couldn't save people by yourself..!?"  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I stop.  
  
Her words splash cold water onto my heated brain.  
  
---  
  
"――――I'm sorry. But Sakura's in danger. I know it's suicidal to go alone, but this is all I can do."  
  
---  
  
"...I thought so. But I can't readily help you as long as Shinji is holding Sakura hostage.  
  
But Emiya-kun. If you can manage to get Sakura back from Shinji, I can do the rest."  
  
---  
  
"――――You'll take care of Shinji?"  
  
"No, I'm talking about Rider. Servants are ones who fight other Servants, right?  
  
I'll be hiding, so do anything you can to save Sakura. If you can manage that, I'll save you no matter what, even if you are about to die in the next second."  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka sounds like she's trying to convince herself.  
  
...This is just going to increase the burden on her.  
  
I'm fully aware of that. I got Tohsaka to help me, and now Tohsaka's trying to fulfill our promise.  
  
---  
  
That convinces me.  
  
I'll rely on Tohsaka.  
  
In return, I'm going to get Sakura back.  
  
---  
  
"All right. I'll leave the follow-up to you."  
  
"Yeah. But that's under the condition that you're still alive to protect Sakura.  
  
Even Archer can't protect Sakura while fighting Rider. It's meaningless to save Sakura at the cost of your life."  
  
---  
  
The school building is deserted.  
  
Thanks to the series of comas, the school closed early.  
  
It's not even six o'clock, but there are no students or teachers to be seen.  
  
---  
  
"――――Can you tell where Shinji is, Tohsaka?"  
  
"...Knowing him, he's probably inside. I'm sure he's waiting in familiar territory on an upper floor."  
  
That could only be one place.  
  
Shinji is in the classroom on the third floor.  
  
---  
  
"I'll go ahead. You come later, Tohsaka."  
  
"...Okay. I'll go through the gate after ten minutes.  
  
I didn't tell you, but a boundary field's set up here. I'll be found even if I hide my presence, so keep their attention so they don't notice me."  
  
---  
  
I nod and start running.  
  
――――There's hot steel in my back.  
  
The Magic Circuit is already made.  
  
I tell myself that my only weapon is meant to protect Sakura, not to harm my enemy.  
  
---  
  
"...!"  
  
I stop.  
  
On the third floor hallway are a black Servant and Shinji, holding a knife at Sakura.  
  
---  
  
"You――――!"  
  
My mind explodes.  
  
My feet start to move again.  
  
Then―――the black Servant blocks my way.  
  
---  
  
"Stop. My Master will harm her if you take another step."  
  
"...!"  
  
I slide to an abrupt halt.  
  
My mouth hurts.  
  
I'm gritting my teeth so hard that they're screaming.  
  
---  
  
"Shinji――――!"  
  
"Yo. Just like I thought, you came flying over here. I knew you would come alone if I told you to."  
  
---  
  
"――――!"  
  
My cool brain boils up once again.  
  
My head shakes so much that I almost forget about the Servant in front of me.  
  
---  
  
"...What is that?"  
  
Why is he doing such a thing?  
  
---  
  
Sakura is Shinji's sister.  
  
An older brother should protect his younger sister.  
  
Family members should help each other and laugh together.  
  
So why doesn't he understand?  
  
Something I couldn't protect.  
  
Why can't he understand how Sakura must feel to have her own brother holding a knife to her!?  
  
---  
  
"Are you serious, Shinji――――?"  
  
"Of course. I'm using the last trump card because I'm serious. Why are you stupid even at a time like this?"  
  
---  
  
"...!"  
  
Before I know it, I'm running.  
  
I can't stop until I get Sakura away from him.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
But she's in my way.  
  
Rider is blocking my way, protecting Shinji.  
  
---  
  
"...I do not understand. Why did you come here?  
  
In coming here, you showed you were willing to obey my Master. If you planned to fight, you should not have come alone."  
  
---  
  
"――――!"  
  
...Rider's right.  
  
...I have to calm down.  
  
Since I obeyed Shinji, I have to think only about saving Sakura and not defeating Shinji.  
  
---  
  
"―――――――Phew."  
  
I take a deep breath and pull myself together.  
  
---  
  
Shinji is enjoying my dismay with Sakura in his arms.  
  
...Sakura hasn't raised her head since I arrived.  
  
She's not unconscious.  
  
She's standing unassisted.  
  
Her head is down because she doesn't want to raise it.  
  
---  
  
"―――Shinji. Did you tell her about us?"  
  
I glare at him, unable to hide my anger.  
  
"Huh?"  
  
---  
  
"――――Oh. Oh, I see!  
  
Yeah, don't worry, Emiya. Since you wouldn't tell her, I told her everything! I told her we're both Masters and tried to kill each other!"  
  
---  
  
"――――!"  
  
"Did you want to hide that from her? Are you stupid? Of course she'll find out! She knew you were hiding something, but she couldn't ask you because she's just your underclassman!"  
  
"......!"  
  
---  
  
He presses the blade against Sakura's cheek.  
  
Sakura looks away, but grits her teeth so that she won't raise her face.  
  
---  
  
"Come on, don't be reserved and ask. Emiya won't hide anything now. See, it's your wish come true!"  
  
"――――――――"  
  
She doesn't reply.  
  
With her head down...  
  
---  
  
"Hey. Why aren't you saying anything?  
  
I told you to ask him. I'm telling you to ask him what he thinks of you and if he hates you after finding out that you're a dirty woman of Matou!"  
  
---  
  
"Shinji――――!"  
  
...Her figure looks like she's apologizing to me, and I can't contain myself anymore.  
  
---  
  
"It's fine now, right? I came here, just like I promised. Let Sakura go."  
  
"What? I didn't promise you anything. I gave you a command.  
  
I just said I wouldn't do anything to Sakura if you came alone."  
  
"――――――――"  
  
---  
  
"Don't glare so much, Emiya. I'm not a devil. I'm glad that you want to save my sister. I'll meet your sincerity if you act accordingly. I can send Sakura home once we're done.  
  
---  
  
"I see―――is that a promise, Shinji?"  
  
"Yeah. I'll let Sakura go if you do as I say.  
  
This is a promise. I swear."  
  
---  
  
"All right. So, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to get on my knees and beg?"  
  
"Nope. What's the fun in making a guy beg? I brought you here to fight. I told you we're settling our match."  
  
---  
  
...Rider takes a step forward.  
  
There's no enmity or intent to kill.  
  
Rider steps forward to obey her Master.  
  
---  
  
"But it's boring to just fight, right? It's not fair since I'm not a magus, and it's obvious that I'll win in a fight.  
  
So to be fair, I'll have her fight you."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――!"  
  
...Heh.  
  
Fight Rider empty-handed, huh?  
  
That's like telling me to die.  
  
---  
  
"I won't take your life. I've told Rider to go easy on you.  
  
Well, I'm sure you'll be a nuisance if you keep running around after today, so I'll have her break your limbs."  
  
---  
  
...Rider is not holding her dagger.  
  
It seems she really is going to go easy on me.  
  
---  
  
"Isn't your job easy? You just have to stand there and get hit like a dumbass.  
  
Oh, but don't go down too soon, okay? If you faint before I'm satisfied, I'll have Sakura take the rest."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
...Rider comes closer.  
  
Three more steps.  
  
Then I'll be within her reach.  
  
---  
  
"...Heh. Don't resist, but don't go down easily?  
  
You're contradicting yourself. What do you want, Shinji?"  
  
---  
  
"Hah, that's obvious, isn't it...!?  
  
I just want to beat the crap out of you...!!"  
  
---  
  
Rider springs forward.  
  
"――――"  
  
I raise both my arms in preparation for her attack.  
  
At that instant――――  
  
An impact that almost blows the bones away with it pierces my right arm.  
  
---  
  
"Guh――――!"  
  
She aimed at my arm that was guarding my face.  
  
My arm is still attached.  
  
But it's numb and I don't feel anything.  
  
---  
  
"Haa......!"  
  
I lace my senses as fast as possible.  
  
I can't do anything bare-handed.  
  
Unless I strengthen everything that can be strengthened, my limbs will be torn clean off.  
  
I have to turn my uniform into steel and turn my body into something even stronger, or the next attack will kill me――――!  
  
---  
  
"――――!"  
  
A tremor runs through my left arm.  
  
The blow like a bushhammer penetrates through my strengthened uniform and tries to break my left arm.  
  
---  
  
"Haa――――you――――!"  
  
Both my arms have been rendered useless in a mere second.  
  
―――No, they do move, but I don't feel them.  
  
I can't use my deadened arms to block her attacks.  
  
If she takes another shot at my head now, I'll be knocked out for sure...!  
  
---  
  
Rider is merciless.  
  
She beats me relentlessly, just as Shinji ordered.  
  
Her movements remind me of a machine.  
  
---  
  
"Ah, guh......!"  
  
I protect my face with arms that barely move.  
  
From the start, I can't perceive Rider's attacks to block them accordingly.  
  
I have to concentrate on guarding my head so that I won't get knocked unconscious.  
  
---  
  
"Kuh, guh――――!"  
  
What is Rider thinking?  
  
Even though my arms are an easy target, she ignores them.  
  
She only hits my exposed chest and stomach.  
  
...They are agonizing blows, but aren't as strong as the attacks that numbed my arms.  
  
---  
  
"―――――――, ――――"  
  
...It's strange.  
  
With the strength Rider showed at the Ryuudou Temple, a single blow should be enough to tear me in half.  
  
...Is she going easy like Shinji said?  
  
Well, she is going easy on me by not aiming at my face, but even with that in mind, something's not right.  
  
---  
  
"――――――!"  
  
In short, her power is way too different.  
  
A Servant's power is in direct proportion to the magical energy you can feel from them.  
  
---  
  
Rider was a strong Servant back at the Ryuudou Temple.  
  
But the Rider before me now is the Rider that was defeated at the park.  
  
I don't know what happened, but if that's the case, I still have a chance to outwit Shinji―――!  
  
---  
  
"Gu, fu...!"  
  
I fall forward.  
  
Seemingly tired of using me like a punching bag, she steps forward and drives her fist into my stomach.  
  
---  
  
"――――"  
  
It's like a stake gouging into my abdomen.  
  
...The attack is really effective.  
  
The bruises from last night are screaming with pain.  
  
Gastric juice fills my mouth and I almost fall down to my knees.  
  
---  
  
"What, is that it, Emiya? That's pitiful. You're in front of Sakura, so take it like a man!"  
  
...I fall forward.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
Rider steps back and watches.  
  
---  
  
Then...  
  
"――――Ahh......!"  
  
I grab Rider's arm and force myself up.  
  
---  
  
"――――! That's good, Emiya! You're as persistent as a roach!  
  
Ahaha, you're hilarious!"  
  
Ah... guh.  
  
Damn, that hurts. My head is spinning, even though she didn't hit me there―――  
  
---  
  
"But, well... This is a third-rate show. Even if we continue, it'll just be more of the same. I'm getting bored, so let's finish it off with an exciting knockout scene."  
  
---  
  
――――The same?  
  
Are you stupid? What's the same about this?  
  
We're standing in a different position now.  
  
Hasn't he noticed that I switched positions with Rider when I pulled myself up using her arm?  
  
---  
  
"――――There are about five more meters. Your patience has won out."  
  
"What...?"  
  
I raise my head.  
  
What did Rider just say?  
  
---  
  
"Enough resting. Start the second round, Emiya."  
  
Rider shakes off my hand.  
  
The black Servant resumes her attacks with the artificiality of a machine.  
  
---  
  
―――I'm being pushed back.  
  
To avoid finishing me off, Rider's attacks stay clear of my vital areas.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
My body is numb.  
  
I'm bruised everywhere I got hit, and I don't feel pain anymore.  
  
It's because the pain from within is worse than her attacks.  
  
Rider has attacked me to destroy my body.  
  
---  
  
"――――――Prepare yourself."  
  
The black Servant closes the distance with an emotionless voice.  
  
---  
  
And in that moment, I am certain.  
  
This isn't part of Shinji's plan.  
  
Rider's decision not to go for my head,  
  
and that I can still move my body...  
  
It's not because Shinji ordered her to go easy on me, but――――  
  
---  
  
"All right, you don't have to hold back anymore! Kill him, Rider!"  
  
"...!? Nii-san, stop...!"  
  
---  
  
Rider's hair flutters as she steps in...  
  
...and hits me in the chest with her most powerful strike yet.  
  
---  
  
"Guh――――――――"  
  
I can't breathe.  
  
I don't feel the ground anymore.  
  
Her attack almost blows me unconscious even though I knew it was coming.  
  
---  
  
"Senpai...!"  
  
---  
  
I hear a scream and a delighted laugh as I fly through the air.  
  
...Sakura's voice is close.  
  
---  
  
―――I fall.  
  
Under normal circumstances, I would've hit the floor and died.  
  
The impact of the fall doesn't matter.  
  
It's an attack strong enough to blow a human away.  
  
It wouldn't be surprising if the strike blew a hole in my chest.  
  
---  
  
"......Hah."  
  
But I'm alive.  
  
Anyone can jump back if the timing is set so perfectly.  
  
That attack wasn't meant to kill me.  
  
She's kept me conscious and mobile, not because of Shinji's order, but――――of her own free will.  
  
---  
  
"――――Now."  
  
The range is perfect.  
  
I turn my body right before I hit the ground, straighten myself instantly,  
  
---  
  
"Huh?"  
  
and grab the knife in front of me with my left hand.  
  
---  
  
I catch it by the blade.  
  
I don't care about it digging into my hand because it's numb.  
  
---  
  
"W-What――――!?"  
  
I raise my other arm.  
  
Without a thought for the pain...  
  
---  
  
I punch him square in the face with my clenched fist.  
  
---  
  
## Scene 22 Truth about Sakura  
  
  
  
"――――Ah."  
  
I throw away the knife.  
  
Trying not to look at the blood, I run to where Sakura is sitting.  
  
---  
  
"Sakura...!"  
  
"...Senpai――――"  
  
Sakura doesn't raise her head to look at me.  
  
---  
  
...She's trying to avoid talking to me.  
  
I don't know if it's because of Shinji, or because of all the things I've hidden from her.  
  
All I can tell is that Sakura's body is hotter than this morning.  
  
---  
  
"...It's fine. Let's talk later.  
  
We'll go home for now and――――"  
  
"...!"  
  
"It's over. The match is decided, Shinji."  
  
---  
  
...Then.  
  
I realize that Tohsaka is behind me.  
  
---  
  
After being wounded by Archer, Rider is crouching down on the floor.  
  
Her clothes are wet with blood. Even though it's not fatal, she shouldn't be able to continue fighting.  
  
---  
  
"T-Tohsaka...!?  
  
Damn, that's not fair! You broke your promise, Emiya...! I told you to come alone!"  
  
---  
  
"Yeah. But that was an order, not a promise, right? Then I think it's illogical to call it unfair."  
  
---  
  
"T―――That's sophistry! It's natural for him to come alone since he said he'll come alone!"  
  
---  
  
"...That's fine.  
  
We were together, but Emiya-kun didn't ask me for help. I came here because I wanted to."  
  
---  
  
"You're lying...! Why are you here if he didn't get you!?  
  
Emiya acted honest and tricked me!"  
  
---  
  
"Oh, that? That's simple. I was next to him when you called. You had such a loud voice, Matou-kun. I was able to hear you even though Emiya-kun was trying to hide it."  
  
---  
  
"Do you understand now? There's no way I'd just sit there if Sakura's been kidnapped. You lured Emiya-kun to you at the price of making me your enemy."  
  
---  
  
"Kuh―――so you're here for Sakura too?  
  
...Sakura. Sakura, Sakura, Sakura, SakuraSakuraSakuraSakuraSakura...!  
  
I don't believe this! Are you still concerned about it!? She's just a quiet bitch that shrinks with fear! Look, I'm a Master!  
  
You shouldn't worry about them! You should just be concerned about me...!!"  
  
---  
  
"I see. Then why don't you make your Servant fight?  
  
Archer only cut her stomach. He hasn't destroyed the core of her embodiment, her neck or her heart. Go ahead and heal Rider if you're a legitimate Master."  
  
"Kuh――――damn you...!"  
  
---  
  
Shinji scrambles away and takes out a book.  
  
"That's――――"  
  
That's Shinji's Command Spell that burned up at that park.  
  
He still has it...!?  
  
---  
  
"Get up, Rider! It's your Master's order! Get up and beat Archer...!"  
  
"――――――――"  
  
There's no reply.  
  
Rider is crouching, motionless.  
  
---  
  
A puddle of blood is under her, and the blood keeps flowing.  
  
She is the one who needs help right now.  
  
To order her to fight is to hasten her death.  
  
---  
  
"Damn...! You're my Servant, so fight until you die, you bitch...!"  
  
---  
  
Shinji's fingers tighten on the book.  
  
That must be how he uses his Command Spell. With trembling movements, Rider tries to stand.  
  
---  
  
"Stop―――that's enough, Shinji, give up...! Rider will die if you push her any more...!"  
  
"Hah! Servants don't die that easily! You just shut up and take care of that piece of trash...!"  
  
---  
  
Shinji does not relent.  
  
"......!"  
  
I let go of Sakura and rush him again.  
  
---  
  
―――At that instant...  
  
"...No...! No more...!"  
  
---  
  
"――――Sakura?"  
  
I stop and turn back.  
  
Clutching her stomach, she moans as if in the throes of a nightmare.  
  
---  
  
"Wha――――!?"  
  
Shinji's book burns to ashes, just as it did that night.  
  
---  
  
"――――What?"  
  
Wind blows inside the enclosed hallway.  
  
It's coming from Rider, who was lying on the ground, and from Sakura, who is still crouching.  
  
---  
  
"――――No way. This is Rider...?"  
  
Tohsaka stands ready while Archer silently watches the enemy that stood up.  
  
Rider is completely healed.  
  
The power flowing from her body is just like when she was at the Ryuudou Temple.  
  
---  
  
"――――?"  
  
Then.  
  
Her figure disappears.  
  
Rider suddenly disappears from my vision...  
  
---  
  
"Get down, Emiya-kun――――!"  
  
"...!"  
  
---  
  
The moment I duck, long hair flutters right above me.  
  
---  
  
"Sakura...!"  
  
Rider has instantly jumped with Sakura in hand.  
  
She lands opposite us―――between Shinji and the rest of us.  
  
---  
  
"Huh? ...What are you doing? Who told you to bring Sakura?"  
  
"No, there was no such order. As a Servant, I merely protected my Master."  
  
---  
  
Rider lets Sakura down and glances at Shinji.  
  
...Her eyes are covered with a leather mask, but her expression is frighteningly cold.  
  
---  
  
"D-Don't be stupid. I'm your Master. Why are you wasting time instead of protecting me――――"  
  
"Shinji. A Command Spell appears on the body of a Master. I have never accepted anyone who does not bear the holy sign as my Master."  
  
---  
  
"What―――?"  
  
"You are a fraud. You have lost the book which granted you false ownership, so I can no longer obey you."  
  
---  
  
Rider turns away from Shinji.  
  
That motion tells Shinji that she will never look at him again.  
  
---  
  
"―――I see. So that's how it was, Rider?"  
  
"Your guess is correct, Archer's Master.  
  
You already knew, did you not?"  
  
---  
  
"...Yeah. I knew it was strange.  
  
There's no way one of the Matous would be chosen as a Master. Their bloodline has grown thin, so no magi should be born to them."  
  
---  
  
"So it shouldn't be possible for Shinji, one of the Matou family, to become a Master. But Rider was summoned, and a person from the Matou household was chosen as a Master."  
  
---  
  
"...Yes. I thought Matou Zouken summoned you and entrusted you to Shinji.  
  
But it's actually much more simple. Zouken doesn't need to do anything. Because the most appropriate person in the Matou household to be a Master is―――"  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka isn't looking at Rider.  
  
She is only looking at...  
  
"―――The legitimate successor of Matou.  
  
This generation's magus of the Matou line. It's you, Sakura."  
  
"......"  
  
She's looking straight at Sakura.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――Huh?"  
  
I can't say anything.  
  
Tohsaka and Sakura.  
  
I can only look at them alternately and try to figure out what was just said.  
  
---  
  
...My left hand hurts.  
  
My relaxed mind finally starts to inform me of the pain on my hand.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I see.  
  
It seems my mind is calm.  
  
Tohsaka's words and the sight of the Command Spell on Sakura's left hand have numbed my senses, but―――my mind isn't surprised at all.  
  
---  
  
Only... why?  
  
Why did such a thing happen――――?  
  
---  
  
"........."  
  
Sakura is hanging her head as if trying to hide.  
  
Judging by her body language, she didn't want me to know.  
  
---  
  
"...Transfer of a Command Spell. A Command Spell ordering her to obey Matou Shinji, huh?  
  
Rider became Shinji's Servant with that, and you lost your right as a Master at the same time, becoming an ordinary magus. ...So when I first had you show me your arm, you'd already given your Command Spell to Shinji."  
  
---  
  
"............"  
  
Sakura doesn't answer and bites her lips.  
  
---  
  
Then.  
  
---  
  
"Damn, again, Sakura! Give me the right to control her again!"  
  
Shinji runs to her as if begging her.  
  
---  
  
"............"  
  
"Hey, say something! You don't want to fight, right? You said you didn't want to be a Master, so that's why I took over in your place!  
  
Why are you pretending to be a good girl now...!?"  
  
---  
  
Shinji raises his arm.  
  
...But there's no need for me to stop him.  
  
"R-Rider―――are you going to disobey me?"  
  
"You are not my Master, Shinji. If you intend to harm Sakura, I will kill you."  
  
---  
  
Rider releases him.  
  
Shinji backs away, clutching his arm where Rider gripped it.  
  
---  
  
"Ha, haha――――I see. You'll regret that, Rider. No matter what you say, everything will be back to normal when Sakura makes another book.  
  
Do you know what'll happen to you once you become my Servant again――――?"  
  
---  
  
"It's useless, Shinji. It's almost impossible to entrust a Servant to a human, and someone that's not a magus at that. The transfer using the Command Spell made it possible."  
  
---  
  
"Y-Yeah. There's one more Command Spell.  
  
Sakura won't disobey me, so..."  
  
---  
  
"That's why this is it. Sakura only has one more Command Spell. If you use it, you'll have no way to control Rider.  
  
Rider would be freed. You can't bind a Servant with a fake right made with a Command Spell. It'll just burn your book like earlier even if you order Rider."  
  
---  
  
"Wha―――― Then I'm..."  
  
"Yes. You lost your chance to be a Master.  
  
No, you were never a Master as you were only controlling her using a fake Command Spell."  
  
---  
  
...A crack runs through.  
  
With a sound, the existence of Matou Shinji breaks.  
  
---  
  
"Ha――――Ha. I see, so it was impossible from the beginning. I have no talent. The old man cast me aside as a failure, and I was pitied.  
  
...Yeah, it's only natural. I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it...! I knew from the beginning that I'm not suited!"  
  
---  
  
"――――Nii-san."  
  
"No, don't worry about it, Sakura. This was all just a farce. I knew that I have no talent. You're the family's heir. There was no need for me to butt in."  
  
---  
  
"Nii-san."  
  
"Yeah, I know, I know.  
  
So, Sakura――――you continue."  
  
---  
  
"Huh...?"  
  
"I'm telling you to beat them  
  
---  
  
in my place! Look, Emiya and Tohsaka are enemies! You're the successor of Matou, so act like one...!"  
  
---  
  
"Shinji―――haven't you heard a thing I've said?  
  
Sakura won't fight, and you have no right. We won't attack you, since you don't have Rider anymore. Just stay in hiding until the Holy Grail War ends."  
  
---  
  
"I'm not asking you. ―――Come on, Sakura. I'm telling you. You're going to obey me like always, right?"  
  
---  
  
"......"  
  
There's no reply.  
  
Sakura clenches her fists, turns her back to Shinji,  
  
---  
  
"...I don't want to. Let's stop, Nii-san."  
  
and clearly refuses his order.  
  
---  
  
"――――Sakura. What did you just say?"  
  
"...I don't want to. You broke your promise. You said you wouldn't kill Senpai, but you broke our promise.  
  
So――――"  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
Sakura doesn't turn to look at Shinji.  
  
Shinji looks at it like someone else's matter and laughs.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I feel a chill, and in that instant...  
  
"―――All right. Then you can die."  
  
I hear the sound of glass breaking.  
  
---  
  
"Ahh――――!"  
  
Sakura falls.  
  
Her knees lose strength and she falls to the ground.  
  
---  
  
"Hah, bye, Sakura! If you're going to hold a grudge, don't hold it at me, but hold it against that old man for making your body like that. Well, you were gonna end up like that anyway. It's better for you to be freed from the pain now――――!"  
  
Shinji runs away.  
  
---  
  
"Ah――――ha, ah――――!"  
  
Sakura tears at her chest.  
  
―――Her earring breaks and chemical-like liquid is pouring out of it.  
  
---  
  
"Ah――――no――――no......!"  
  
She goes into convulsions.  
  
No, it's worse.  
  
Sakura's shaking so bad that it seems like she's going to crumble like a building in an earthquake.  
  
---  
  
"Sakura...!"  
  
I don't get what's going on.  
  
In my worry, I run to her.  
  
---  
  
"Fool――――! Don't you understand what's going on!?"  
  
"...!"  
  
Someone stops me.  
  
I don't know when he got here, but Archer is grabbing my shoulder.  
  
---  
  
"Get away from here. You will not be able to restore her if you feed her without care."  
  
Archer pushes me back and says something strange.  
  
---  
  
"Feed her...? What do you mean――――?"  
  
The question dies in my throat.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
The hallway tints red.  
  
The air becomes a mist, moistening our skin, and every wall starts to sweat like honey.  
  
---  
  
"Ow, guh――――!?"  
  
...My chest is burning.  
  
This air.  
  
This red world is a different world made by magecraft.  
  
This must be a boundary field that melts everything within its framework, on this premise.  
  
---  
  
"Tohsaka, this is――――"  
  
I can't breathe.  
  
No, the mist clogs my throat and burns me from the inside when I breathe.  
  
---  
  
"...It's the boundary field Shinji set up here.  
  
But it's much stronger now that Sakura is Rider's Master."  
  
"Wha――――――"  
  
---  
  
I look.  
  
...On the other side of the hallway is Sakura, clawing at her chest in agony,  
  
and Rider, who is confronting Archer to protect Sakura.  
  
---  
  
"――――Move aside, Rider. Your master is running wild. She will be addicted to it unless she is stopped before she gets a taste of another's magical energy."  
  
"I refuse. My role is to protect my Master. I cannot let you through as long as you are trying to kill Sakura."  
  
---  
  
"...Oh. So you will stand there and let your master die? Your Master is using up magical energy at a high rate. Do you understand that she will certainly die if you leave her alone?"  
  
---  
  
"No. She can avoid death if she takes in more magical energy than she loses.  
  
Fortunately, there are two magi here. Shinji escaped, but they cannot escape now. I shall take your Master before Sakura is consumed."  
  
---  
  
"Heh―――so your character doesn't change even with a new Master, huh?  
  
It seems you value yourself over other people's lives."  
  
"That goes for you too. You are trying to protect your Master by ignoring mine."  
  
"I see―――then there's no need for either one of us to hold back―――!"  
  
---  
  
Archer charges.  
  
...Without heed for the corrosive boundary field, he rushes at where Sakura still crouches on the ground.  
  
And he clashes with Rider as she blocks his way.  
  
---  
  
"Hey―――are you okay with this, Tohsaka!? He started fighting with Rider...!"  
  
"...Of course they have to fight. We won't last like this. ...And as a fellow magus, I have to prevent Sakura from becoming a heretic."  
  
---  
  
"Huh――――?"  
  
Heretic...?  
  
Are those people who use magecraft against the law of the Association, or people who cannot stop the Magic Circuit and destroy themselves...?  
  
---  
  
"――――Wait. What is that? Why Sakura?"  
  
"She's running wild. Rider made this boundary field, but Sakura's the one maintaining it. I don't know what Shinji did, but Sakura's attacking indiscriminately now."  
  
---  
  
"...I bet Sakura is like us. It's just painful and she just wants air, so she's sucking on other people's air, or magical energy in this case. ―――I can't leave her be as the supervisor of Fuyuki."  
  
---  
  
"Wha――――? You can't leave her be? What are you going to do to Sakura!?"  
  
"...Ask Archer. I only know of one way to stop a magus like that. But Archer might know of some other way."  
  
---  
  
"...Well, we have to do something about Rider before that anyway. From what I can see, Archer is the stronger of the two, but it seems his output is down."  
  
"...Output is down?"  
  
---  
  
I look back at the hallway.  
  
Archer is overwhelming, even in my eyes.  
  
In terms of pure power, he is stronger. There's no way that Rider can hold him back.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
But.  
  
It's strange.  
  
---  
  
Rider's strength is her agility.  
  
She shouldn't be good at fights where she has to protect someone.  
  
Being forced to protect someone should put her at a disadvantage.  
  
Archer should've already defeated her and moved on to Sakura.  
  
But that's not the case――――so could Rider be overwhelming him...?  
  
---  
  
"Fu――――!"  
  
Archer's sword swings through empty air.  
  
Her hair flowing as she moves, Rider arches back and avoids the attack, then steps in and slashes at Archer.  
  
---  
  
But Rider isn't the only one who attacks and defends at the same time.  
  
Archer repels Rider's dagger with his other sword and pushes her back.  
  
---  
  
――――Advance and retreat.  
  
They are evenly matched. Archer cannot press forward, Rider cannot force him back, and they consequently clash swords without any progress.  
  
---  
  
"Kuh――――"  
  
The impatient one is Archer.  
  
Though his enemy is weaker than him, he cannot repel her, and the boundary field is slowly taking his energy.  
  
---  
  
And to add, Tohsaka and I are at our limits.  
  
Just stopping our breaths is painful, so being in the hallway stabs at our minds.  
  
At this pace, we'll fall before Archer defeats Rider.  
  
---  
  
"Damn――――"  
  
Archer clucks his tongue in annoyance.  
  
There.  
  
---  
  
"―――I understand your power.  
  
I am sorry, but you cannot defeat me."  
  
Rider stops and makes an announcement in a regretful voice.  
  
---  
  
"What...?"  
  
"I said you cannot beat me. You are not using your Noble Phantasm. I do not know if your Master has forbidden you from doing so or if you are concerned for Sakura's safety.  
  
Regardless, if you will not use it, this is it. You cannot defeat me."  
  
---  
  
Planting her feet, her only weapon, Rider confronts Archer.  
  
...She looks so defenseless that the match could be decided if Archer attacked her now.  
  
---  
  
"...Hah. I'm not worried for your Master. I just think that there is no need.  
  
And you cannot use your Noble Phantasm either. Matou Shinji was your Master until just now, so you do not have enough magical energy stocked up to use it."  
  
---  
  
"Yes. Shinji could not give me magical energy. So I cannot use my Noble Phantasm right now."  
  
---  
  
"...That's right. There's no need to waste my magical energy against an opponent who will not use it. I will slash you with my next attack, proceed and slash that girl, and everything will end."  
  
---  
  
"Yes. Let's say that's how it will be.  
  
It will be easier for me to kill you if that is the case."  
  
Rider answers calmly.  
  
---  
  
―――What does she intend to do?  
  
Without even readying her weapon, Rider stands against Archer...  
  
"...No, Rider...!"  
  
...but stops when she hears the voice.  
  
---  
  
"Please endure there, Sakura. I will solve everything."  
  
"Stop―――please stop, Rider. I didn't call for you for something like this."  
  
"...I cannot follow that order. Your life takes priority above all else."  
  
---  
  
Rider raises her arm.  
  
There's four meters between her and Archer.  
  
Maintaining that distance, the black Servant puts her hand on her face and...  
  
---  
  
"―――Also...  
  
This is what you wished for, Sakura."  
  
...She releases the black seal.  
  
---  
  
――――Everything solidifies at that instant.  
  
---  
  
Rider's naked eyes.  
  
They are inhuman eyes, one of the highest rank among numerous mystic eyes.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
Grey eyes.  
  
They look like crystals, and they are too abnormal to be called eyeballs.  
  
---  
  
The corneas do not take in light.  
  
The pupil sees the world through a square.  
  
The iris is solidified, not allowing the eyes to close.  
  
The millions of cells that make up the retina are composed of ether.  
  
---  
  
―――Are they art that the gods admired, or are they nature that the gods cursed?  
  
Rider's gray eyes are abnormal, and at the same time, too beautiful for any human to have.  
  
---  
  
"――――!"  
  
Archer is frozen in place.  
  
...It must be because he saw her eyes from such close range.  
  
His eyes are frozen even if he wants to close them, and his arms are frozen even if he wants to cover his eyes.  
  
He tries to charge forward and slash at Rider, but his legs are already petrified up to his knees.  
  
---  
  
"No way, mystic eyes of petrification...!?"  
  
Tohsaka's voice is almost a scream.  
  
...I can't tell what kind of face she's making.  
  
My eyes are also captivated by Rider's mystic eyes, and I can't look away.  
  
My blood is thickening.  
  
The flow is solidified, and my senses are ceased.  
  
---  
  
――――Mystic eyes.  
  
A single action magecraft that magi have.  
  
---  
  
It takes the eyes, passive receptors of the world, and makes them function actively to influence the world.  
  
It indiscriminately casts its magecraft upon anyone within sight, though the effect is vastly increased if the target meets your gaze.  
  
In short, it's something not to be looked at, and it is a frightening magical nature that entraps anyone that looks at them.  
  
---  
  
Their abilities and concealable nature make the mystic eyes proof of a first-rate magus.  
  
The technique to make one's own eyes into a Magic Circuit is close to that of a Magic Crest.  
  
---  
  
But then, artificial mystic eyes only have strong enough powers to cast Charm or Whisper.  
  
Possessors of truly powerful mystic eyes are always born with them.  
  
---  
  
Binding. Coercion. Contract. Burning. Illusion. Extreme luck.  
  
Mystic eyes that directly intervene with another's fate are called Noble Color, and among the highest-ranked of them are the eyes of petrification.  
  
---  
  
No magus of this age possesses these eyes.  
  
There are only a few magi that make petrification magecraft possible.  
  
How great a miracle is it to be possible to petrify others just by looking?  
  
---  
  
...Breaker Gorgon.  
  
It is the curse of the gods sealed by the powers of shrines.  
  
It is said that such evil eyes were only possessed by evil beasts and spirits in the age of the gods.  
  
The magical Noble Phantasm that can petrify people with its glance, the symbol of the heroic spirit Medusa――――!  
  
---  
  
"―――Get away, Rin! The real attack is coming...!"  
  
Archer screams, his body now petrified up to his waist.  
  
...Beyond him...  
  
A dark-red wave is expanding from within Rider, who has released her mystic eyes.  
  
---  
  
"Wait... even if you tell me...!"  
  
Tohsaka is moving too slowly.  
  
Something terrible is flowing forth from the other side of the hallway.  
  
The wave becomes sharp like a spear and aims straight at Tohsaka.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
She'll die.  
  
Tohsaka must be more entranced than me, as she cannot even move a step.  
  
Unable to dodge, she will be impaled by the spear.  
  
With the scene of several seconds in the future in mind, I...  
  
---  
  
## Scene 23 Dead End Stone coffin  
  
  
  
―――I'm the only one who can move.  
  
Archer and Tohsaka are sealed by Rider's mystic eyes.  
  
Then I just need to get the main cause――――!  
  
---  
  
I run at Rider.  
  
Even if I can't beat her, I should at least be able to make her look away from Archer for a second...!  
  
---  
  
"...!? Are you stupid...!? Don't look directly at her...!"  
  
I ignore Archer's voice and run at Rider.  
  
---  
  
―――If those are mystic eyes of petrification, I just need to close my eyes.  
  
The hallway is small.  
  
I know how much distance there is between us.  
  
Rider can attack me or I can haphazardly attack her. Either way, Archer should be able to do something during that opening...!  
  
---  
  
―――But my legs freeze.  
  
No, they are literally petrified.  
  
---  
  
"Wh――――"  
  
It's not just my legs.  
  
The petrification does not stop and reaches my waist, hardens my chest, destroys my arms, and locks up my closed eyes forever.  
  
"――――Why?"  
  
---  
  
"―――How foolish.  
  
Trying to block my mystic eyes by merely closing your eyes. It doesn't matter if you look at me with your naked eyes or your mind's eye, as it is a curse to look at me in any way."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――, ――――――――"  
  
I can't move my throat or my mouth.  
  
...I can't even tell what's going on.  
  
Even if Tohsaka screamed,  
  
or if Archer fell to the ground...  
  
I have no way to know, as I'm petrified.  
  
---  
  
My body has turned to stone, and my mind is swiftly following.  
  
...The three sisters from the legend are immortal.  
  
Just like them, my body will never change.  
  
---  
  
## Scene 24 Tiger Dojo 29  
  
  
  
...Um, it's the Tiger Dojo, but... isn't it a bit strange this time?  
  
---  
  
Osu, that's not true.  
  
It's the normal, peaceful and fun Tiger Dojo!  
  
---  
  
Uh, I feel murderous intent again... No, this isn't just my imagination. I think something bad is glaring at me.  
  
---  
  
Well, this dead end is your usual abrupt death!  
  
---  
  
Once you see Rider's eyes, you can't get away from her mystic eyes. It's smarter to go into defense rather than trying to attack.  
  
---  
  
Wait! Hold on! Something is weird, there's someone behind me! But I'm too scared to turn around and look!  
  
---  
  
Hmm, but Shirou sure does die in bizarre ways.  
  
It's rare even in our world to die of petrification.  
  
---  
  
It's near me! The rare death is right near me!  
  
Why do I deserve this!?  
  
---  
  
Why? It's because Sakura's the type to bear grudges.  
  
---  
  
Don't you remember saying it before, Taiga? You said Rider's Master is a twisted snake woman.  
  
---  
  
Whoa, maybe I did say something like that...  
  
---  
  
Whoa!  
  
Heeeelp meeee, soooomeone!  
  
---  
  
Well, the Tiger Dojo is over!  
  
---  
  
You reap what you sow.  
  
Be careful about talking behind people's backs!  
  
---  
  
## Scene 25 Direct hit  
  
  
  
―――My legs won't move.  
  
I can't move and can only watch as the black spear pierces Tohsaka...  
  
"――――What?"  
  
And I see it change its course at the last second.  
  
---  
  
―――The weapon wavers.  
  
The weapon that came flying at Tohsaka changes its direction at the very last moment.  
  
The black spear rotates.  
  
As if it has found better prey, it lances towards me.  
  
---  
  
"――――Ow."  
  
A dull piercing sound.  
  
...My body is burning.  
  
My vision is wavering as if I have a high fever.  
  
---  
  
"――――Senpai?"  
  
---  
  
...A familiar voice from a distance.  
  
My sense of reality is fading.  
  
My mind whites out and my left arm bleeds red, mixing like paint.  
  
---  
  
"――――No."  
  
---  
  
I see Sakura staring at me as I fall to the floor.  
  
---  
  
"Nooooooo...!!!"  
  
---  
  
And she falls to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut.  
  
---  
  
"How do you feel? Have you calmed down?"  
  
"―――――――――"  
  
Sitting on the church's long bench, I nod silently.  
  
---  
  
"I see. Then there's no need for treatment. Your wounds should all heal as your energy recovers, so just rest for now."  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka sits a bit away from me.  
  
...The distance between our minds is much greater than this.  
  
There's no idle conversation as we wait for Kotomine.  
  
---  
  
"―――――――!"  
  
My left hand screams with pain when I clench it.  
  
It feels like there's a nail driven through my palm.  
  
The cut from grabbing the knife hurts more than the bruises from Rider or the stab wound from Sakura.  
  
---  
  
The dark clouds block the view of the night sky.  
  
The rain clouds tell me that it's going to rain soon.  
  
---  
  
"......"  
  
...I guess the spear-like thing that attacked Tohsaka was Sakura's magecraft.  
  
---  
  
The magical nature that the Matou household inherits is "absorption".  
  
When lack of magical energy made Sakura suffer, she unconsciously cast the spell.  
  
It stabbed and entangled around my arm because Sakura needed help, and it sucked all the magical energy out of me.  
  
---  
  
Magical energy is life force.  
  
It's natural for me to lose consciousness when it's sucked out of me.  
  
I'd already used up my energy when I fought Rider, so I easily fell unconscious, and Tohsaka brought me to the church after that.  
  
...I hear Sakura fainted when she saw me fall.  
  
---  
  
"―――She attacked herself."  
  
Tohsaka murmurs and explains to me that she's getting treated in the back right now.  
  
---  
  
## Scene 26 Save Rin  
  
  
  
There's no time to think.  
  
I can still move my legs and arms.  
  
Then I just need to move forward and pull Tohsaka――――  
  
---  
  
"Tohsaka――――!"  
  
"What?"  
  
Tohsaka doesn't even budge when I grab her arm and pull.  
  
It seems she's heavier than she looks.  
  
---  
  
"Damn, you're heavy――――!"  
  
She doesn't move even when I pull with both my arms.  
  
Then all that's left is...  
  
"Damn, just move――――!"  
  
I charge at her to push her away...!  
  
---  
  
"――――Ow."  
  
I hear a dull piercing sound.  
  
---  
  
"―――W-What are you doing!?"  
  
"Toh――――"  
  
I can't hear her voice clearly.  
  
---  
  
...My body is burning.  
  
Everything is hazy, as though I have a high fever.  
  
---  
  
"――――Senpai?"  
  
---  
  
...A familiar voice from a distance.  
  
My sense of reality is fading.  
  
My mind whites out and my left arm bleeds red, mixing like paint.

"――――No."

And she falls to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut.  
  
---  
  
"How do you feel? Have you calmed down?"  
  
"―――――――――"  
  
Sitting on the church's long bench, I nod silently.  
  
---  
  
"I see. Then there's no need for treatment. Your wounds should all heal as your energy returns, so just rest for now."

"......"  
  
...I guess the spear-like thing that attacked Tohsaka was Sakura's magecraft.  
  
---  
  
The magical nature that the Matou household inherits is "absorption".  
  
When lack of magical energy made Sakura suffer, she unconsciously cast the spell.  
  
She probably aimed at Tohsaka because she had the most magical energy there.  
  
It stabbed and entangled around my arm because I pushed Tohsaka away, and it sucked all the magical energy out of me.  
  
---  
  
Magical energy is life force.

Tohsaka murmurs and explains to me that she's getting treated in the back right now.  
  
---  
  
## Scene 27 Sisters(I)  
  
  
  
It seems Sakura is in critical condition.  
  
The liquid that came out of her earring was poison, and Kotomine is purifying it now.  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka doesn't say anything.  
  
Neither Archer nor Rider are here.  
  
Only the two of us are in the church, waiting for Kotomine's return.  
  
---  
  
"――――Tohsaka."  
  
Still sitting down, I call out to her.  
  
"What?"  
  
"I want to ask you something."  
  
---  
  
"......I thought so. Fine, I'll tell you. It's no use hiding it from you, and it's meaningless to do so now.  
  
So you want to ask about Sakura?"  
  
---  
  
I nod.  
  
Tohsaka takes a deep breath and starts to talk in her normal tone.  
  
---  
  
"―――It all started quite some time ago. The Matou blood started to run thin, and their children were born with fewer and fewer magecraft-Circuits.  
  
The family is originally from another country, so I think the land of Japan didn't suit them.  
  
Their decline started when they started living here, and the Magic Circuit finally disappeared in this generation when Shinji was born."  
  
---  
  
"...The history of Matou ended with that.  
  
They should have taken an apprentice or something if they'd wanted their quest to continue. But the Matous are a distinguished family, and to the last, they refused to take in an outsider.  
  
---  
  
"As a result, their successors had less magical energy, and it finally ran out in the end.  
  
...They finally started looking for an apprentice when that happened, but no magus would come to a fallen family. Hundreds of years of Makiri history should have ended at that time."  
  
---  
  
"But they weren't people who could give up then. Shinji's father adopted a child and taught the child magecraft."  
  
---  
  
"―――So.  
  
I expect you wouldn't know because your family is a special case, but a family of magi hands down its secrets to only one child. They don't teach magecraft to any other children. Zouken said this, right?  
  
If there is a sibling, one is your successor, while the other is raised normally or put up for adoption."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
There's no need for two successors.  
  
In a case of siblings... no, "sisters", what would be done to the one who wasn't needed?  
  
---  
  
Some may raise her and hide from her the fact that they are a family of magi.  
  
But that's difficult and inefficient.  
  
If they trained their Magic Circuit over many generations, it would not be their wish to waste the excellent gene even if she is not chosen as the successor.  
  
Then――――  
  
---  
  
"Tohsaka."  
  
"Yes. I had a sister a year younger than me.  
  
...The declined Matou family had no hope of someone giving them a child for adoption.  
  
It's only natural for them to rely on the Tohsaka family, the ones they held a pact with for a long time."  
  
---  
  
"I don't know which one of us my dad intended to make his successor. But I remained a Tohsaka, and she was taken to the Matou family.  
  
That was eleven years ago.  
  
I couldn't go see her much after that. It was an agreement made with Matou, and I couldn't readily go see the successor of the Matous."  
  
---  
  
"I see. Then you and Sakura are..."  
  
"Real sisters. ...Well, we never called each other like that."  
  
---  
  
...I don't know how much emotion is contained in those simple words.  
  
But that makes me understand.  
  
Why she always asked about Sakura.  
  
Why she didn't let Archer use his Noble Phantasm.  
  
---  
  
"...That's good. You're on Sakura's side."  
  
A dim light shines into the gloom of my mind.  
  
...I don't know what's going to happen to Sakura, or what she's going to do from now on.  
  
But if Tohsaka cares for Sakura, there just might be hope waiting on the ominous path ahead.  
  
---  
  
"No. I'm not her ally or anything."  
  
―――But...  
  
Tohsaka denies me as if reading my thoughts.  
  
---  
  
"Not her ally...?"  
  
"Right. If Sakura can't be cured, I'll dispose of her, just like I would with any other Master gone rampant. I can't sit idly by while a magus indiscriminately attacks people. If Kirei can't treat Sakura, then I'll just have to get rid of her myself."  
  
---  
  
"W―――What are you saying...!? Sakura's your sister, isn't she!? Don't ever say something like that...!"  
  
---  
  
"Sakura is a child of the Matous. She stopped being my sister eleven years ago."  
  
"Tohsaka, you――――"  
  
---  
  
"...Hmph. The outcome won't change even if Sakura is my family as you say. It wouldn't change anything. In fact, that would give you even less right to interfere."  
  
Tohsaka speaks as if it's a matter of course.  
  
---  
  
"―――――Then you're..."  
  
No different from Shinji.  
  
But before I can say the worst thing possible...  
  
---  
  
"What are you doing? The operation is complete, but she is still in critical condition. If you want to make a commotion, go do so outside."  
  
...Kotomine Kirei emerges from the back of the church.  
  
---  
  
"...Hmph. I can't tell if you two are on bad terms or in good harmony."  
  
---  
  
"Oh――――"  
  
"――――H-Heh. You're just mistaken."  
  
---  
  
"I see. Then sit down. I shall explain the state Matou Sakura is in."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
"――――――――"  
  
Taking our separate seats, we listen intently to the priest.  
  
---  
  
"To put it simply, there is a poison, a worm, in Matou Sakura's body. The worm is called crest worm. It is like an artificial sanshi, the three corpses. Do you recognize this name?"  
  
---  
  
...I shake my head.  
  
Sanshi―――a bug said to inhabit a human body that reports the person's evil deeds to the Judge of Hell.  
  
I've heard of sanshi, but I've never heard of a crest worm.  
  
---  
  
"So you do not know. Well, it was originally just a harmless parasite.  
  
It's a familiar that lives off of its host's magical energy. It is of the lowest rank of familiars, as it does nothing beyond telling its master whether or not its host still lives."  
  
---  
  
"......I see. So it's like a monitoring device.  
  
So Zouken's monitoring Sakura with that?"  
  
"Oh. When was it decided that Matou Zouken is the master of the crest worm?"  
  
---  
  
"―――I'm sorry, but I'm in no mood for your long talk. Who else but that old bastard would do something like that to Sakura?"  
  
"I see, that is certainly true. Matou Shinji cannot use crest worms. So it can only be that vampire."  
  
---  
  
"Right? Just go ahead and tell me the result. Can Sakura be saved or not?"  
  
---  
  
"―――You are being hasty, Rin. You seem to understand her condition, but the boy does not. We should explain for his sake, right?"  
  
"......!"  
  
Tohsaka looks away awkwardly.  
  
Judging by her expression, she doesn't want me to find out.  
  
---  
  
"Well, what shall we do, Emiya Shirou? Rin says she just wants to know the result."  
  
"......No. Please explain things in order, Kotomine."  
  
---  
  
...I'm sorry for Tohsaka.  
  
But I can't yield to her about this. If this has to do with Sakura's life, I have to know everything about it.  
  
---  
  
"Then let me continue.  
  
The crest worm I explained earlier is undermining Matou Sakura's nerves.  
  
It must be the result of eleven years spent growing within her. The crest worm has turned into a nerve, like a Magic Circuit, and it has entangled with her own, swarming all throughout her body.  
  
It has transformed into her Magic Crest. Under normal circumstances it is suspended, having no effect on Matou Sakura's body."  
  
---  
  
"But once activated, it will violate Matou Sakura's nerves and will keep moving using her magical energy.  
  
That's what happened earlier. The crest worm roamed through her body, absorbing her magical energy."  
  
---  
  
"Had she remained in that state for half a day, she would certainly have died.  
  
The crest worm would suck all of her magical energy as its power, then eat her flesh as nutrition. It means she would have her body consumed after her magical energy was sucked dry."  
  
---  
  
"If you have a Magic Crest, you should well know how painful it is.  
  
Even the faintest trace of a foreign substance puts a human body through discomfort, and can even be life-threatening. Having another creature entwining its nerves with your own, moving within you, would easily be enough to kill you."  
  
---  
  
"......In that regard, I'm surprised Matou Sakura was conscious until just now.  
  
I do not know if Matou Sakura has a strong will, or if she is just used to the crest worm's activation. We will need to ask her if we want this answered."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I hear a sound.  
  
It's the sound of my teeth grinding.  
  
'If you have a Magic Crest, you should well know how painful it is'?  
  
---  
  
I couldn't possibly know.  
  
I cover myself in sweat just to insert one Magic Circuit into my body.  
  
Sakura has it several times worse.  
  
I couldn't even guess at her pain.  
  
---  
  
"...Hold on. You said if it's activated, right? Then the crest worm isn't usually active?"  
  
---  
  
"That is correct. The poison put on her only awakens the crest worm.  
  
The crest worm is only an observation device.  
  
It is only activated as punishment for the host, Matou Sakura, when she breaks a 'certain condition'."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
Just listening to his words makes me go crazy.  
  
I know it's not something Kotomine did, but I almost attack him for saying that.  
  
---  
  
I suppress my selfish emotion and...  
  
"What is the condition?"  
  
I urge him to go on and tell me the heart of the matter.  
  
---  
  
"Matou Sakura fell, and Rin tried to save her. But Rider prevented her from doing so.  
  
Then the condition is obvious. To abandon the battles as a Master. That should be the restriction of the crest worm."  
  
---  
  
"She has approved of the battles by entrusting Rider to Shinji. But the crest worm will torment her as she refuses it now. It has calmed down for now, but the crest worm will keep tormenting her.  
  
It will tell her, 'What are you doing?  
  
If you are truly a Master, then go kill the other Masters.  
  
If you cannot, I will eat you and kill you'."  
  
---  
  
"――――"  
  
My mind almost breaks down.  
  
Just hearing about it makes sparks flash in my vision. More than anything, I want to kill that old man.  
  
---  
  
"...That's the condition Sakura must follow?"  
  
"It seems so. Nothing else seems likely."  
  
"Then――――! Can't she just not be a Master? If she uses up her Command Spell and cancels the contract with her Servant, she won't be a Master anymore―――"  
  
---  
  
"I would not recommend that.  
  
I told you that the condition of the crest worm's activation is to abandon her duty as a Master.  
  
If she cancels her contract with Rider, the crest worm will consume her for sure."  
  
---  
  
"I see. So she can fight and survive, or refuse to fight and be killed by the crest worm. Those are the only options Sakura has, right?"  
  
---  
  
"Right. The crest worm will torment its host for as long as the Holy Grail War continues.  
  
If her condition keeps up, her body will not last long, and her mind will be destroyed. She has a Magic Crest all over her body, after all.  
  
You should understand how absurd that is, Rin."  
  
---  
  
"...Yeah. Even though it should be familiar with my body, I still periodically get the urge to cut off my arm.  
  
I'm like this with one arm, so her function as a human being should be violated if she has it all over her body.  
  
She's no magus, but a cluster of Magic Circuit. The human mind should be overwritten by the wave of magical energy."  
  
---  
  
"Wha―――then Sakura is..."  
  
"She is in danger if her condition keeps up.  
  
I don't know how many more days she can last, but the crest worm will spread further with each successive day. She will die if we cannot remove it before it infects her whole body, but her body will not last that long in any case."  
  
---  
  
"The only thing I did was to purify the poison.  
  
The surgery to call back her lost magical energy and mind is after this, but the chance of success is very low.  
  
―――That is all.  
  
To sum everything up, Matou Sakura cannot be saved. Are you satisfied now, Emiya Shirou?"  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
There's no way I'm satisfied.  
  
Sakura can't be saved?  
  
That's ridiculous.  
  
She was doing so well until yesterday, so why are things like this now...!?  
  
---  
  
"―――What about removing it? Can't you extract the crest worm?  
  
If you know it's there, you should be able to take it out, right!?"  
  
---  
  
"Extraction would be difficult. The crest worm has already integrated itself into her magecraft-Circuits. Even the one who implanted it wouldn't be able to extract it now.  
  
...Yes. If you wanted to extract it, you would have to rely on a miracle, or the Holy Grail."  
  
---  
  
"――――!"  
  
The Holy Grail.  
  
So that's where it ends up, huh?  
  
Sakura's only choice is to keep fighting as a Master,  
  
and the power of the Holy Grail is the only thing that can save her――――?  
  
---  
  
"I understand the situation now, Kirei. Let me thank you."  
  
She bows without showing much gratitude and confronts the priest.  
  
---  
  
"But isn't this too sudden? The crest worm wasn't implanted in her yesterday. So why did she suddenly reach her limit?"  
  
---  
  
"Why do you ask that now?  
  
Matou Sakura's body was tampered with many years ago. The changes were so extensive that even her hair and eye colors no longer reflect her heritage. This did not start recently."  
  
---  
  
"Well, it seems it was never intended to kill her as it's doing now.  
  
It seems Matou Zouken did not intend to use Matou Sakura in this war. She is not adjusted to fighting. I would assume she was treated that way because unexpected conditions were met."  
  
---  
  
"Unexpected conditions, huh? ...I don't know what those are, but that means Sakura suddenly won Zouken's confidence?"  
  
---  
  
"Probably. I would assume some change occurred within her that Zouken did not expect.  
  
But that is only one factor. There are other reasons for her drastic change.  
  
She is now constantly using magical energy to maintain her Servant. If she cannot spare any for her crest worm, what will the starving worm do?"  
  
---  
  
"...I see. Regardless of the conditions, it'll drain her body to acquire the magical energy it's not getting―――  
  
But she wouldn't lose magical energy if she doesn't use Rider, so――――"  
  
---  
  
"Yes, she should be able to live as before, for a while.  
  
But I don't think the old man will let Matou Sakura do as she wishes."  
  
---  
  
"......Right. He wouldn't plant a creature like that in her otherwise.  
  
The worm will kill her if she doesn't fight,  
  
and her body will also be destroyed if she fights and uses up magical energy.  
  
No, not only that, but Zouken can do anything he wants with Sakura because he's the one who planted the worm in her."  
  
---  
  
"―――He can do anything he wants with Sakura...?"  
  
"Yes. Zouken is holding Sakura's life in his hands. So defeating Zouken is the only way to save Sakura.  
  
―――But Emiya-kun.  
  
You have to defeat Sakura before you can defeat Zouken. She's his puppet. I'm sure he would use her as his shield if you corner him."  
  
---  
  
"Exactly. Matou Sakura is a convenient tool for Zouken. He will control Matou Sakura as he instigated Matou Shinji.  
  
In fact, she is superior as a Master. She is urged on by her worm, and she will run even wilder than Matou Shinji, just like Zouken wants."  
  
"―――――!"  
  
---  
  
"...But I will be a bit irritated if everything goes his way.  
  
I will perform the surgery on Matou Sakura. I have purified her poison and anesthetized her. The healing and the extraction of the crest worm will be performed next."  
  
---  
  
"Huh...? Hey, Kirei..."  
  
"It is hopeless, but I will do my best. I cannot simply allow Matou Sakura to die. And what sort of priest would I be if all I could do was rely on the Holy Grail?"  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
Tohsaka's surprise is natural.  
  
His words are surprising even to me, and I've only known him for a short while.  
  
...This isn't a guess, but a conviction.  
  
Kotomine is seriously trying to save Sakura.  
  
It might just be because he's a priest, but this is too much even for that.  
  
---  
  
"...What's going on? This is the first time I've seen you support someone like this."  
  
"It's not just a whim. It is simply too wasteful to let her die.  
  
Well, I suppose it is better for the two of you to have another Master eliminated."  
  
---  
  
The priest's response is plain.  
  
Tohsaka glares at the priest...  
  
"―――――I'll leave her to you. I'm going to come back when the surgery should be over."  
  
...And leaves the church with those words.  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka leaves, and the church regains its silence.  
  
The priest silently sees Tohsaka off, and I can't even stand up because I can't think of anything.  
  
---  
  
"What are you doing? You are of no use to me here. I want no distractions. Go kill some time until the surgery ends."  
  
"――――I won't bother you. I trust you when it comes to surgeries. You helped that woman before too."  
  
---  
  
"Hah. The scale of this surgery is much greater than before.  
  
Matou Sakura stopped herself by shooting herself. She is suffering from autointoxication probably because she harmed you. To put it simply, she killed her own mind to stop herself since she was controlled by Zouken."  
  
---  
  
"The procedure I'm about to perform is like starting a heart that has stopped. ...Well, the crest worm has kept her body alive. If all I have to do is recover her mind, it should succeed."  
  
---  
  
"But your presence here is a liability. If you come barging in when you hear her scream, I will certainly fail. In any case, you bear no responsibility for her sufferings. You and Matou Sakura are strangers now."  
  
---  
  
"――――Strangers?"  
  
"I am telling you not to have any sympathy for her.  
  
There is nothing you can do. Leave, like Rin has done."  
  
---  
  
"―――Why? Can't I pray for her sake here if I can't do anything?"  
  
"That is a crime. You have no right to share her pain.  
  
Do you not understand? I am telling you the surgery will fail if you are here. You are only a harmful enemy to Sakura right now."  
  
---  
  
"Wh――――"  
  
I can't finish my sentence.  
  
His words are heavy, and they are pointing out the crimes I didn't know I had committed.  
  
---  
  
"Matou Sakura feels some kind of guilt towards you. If you are near her, she may refuse to wake up."  
  
"...Guilt towards me...?"  
  
---  
  
"Yes. It is more like repentance than guilt.  
  
―――She is a victim of sexual abuse. It is easy to imagine the kind of training Matou Zouken imposed on her.  
  
To state the fact, Matou Sakura is not a pure virgin, but a woman who knows men."  
  
---  
  
"――――――"  
  
I'm not surprised.  
  
I know this feeling.  
  
It's just like when I found out Sakura was a Master.  
  
I silently accepted the truth when I saw the Command Spell on her hand.  
  
---  
  
"The girl tried to hide that fact from you, but always sought salvation.  
  
I don't know how long the abuse called inheritance of magecraft lasted."  
  
---  
  
"But―――what do you honestly think you can do now, when you stood by her side, completely oblivious, for all that time?  
  
That's what I mean by you not having the right to pray here. But if you still care for Matou Sakura, leave. That's all you can do for now."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
...I get up.  
  
̊ It's not that he's talked me into it.  
  
It's just that―――what he's saying is correct.  
  
I shouldn't be here if I really care for Sakura.  
  
I shouldn't be allowed to care for Sakura when I can't think at all.  
  
---  
  
I turn my back to the priest and head for the door.  
  
"Oh. I do not think I even need to mention this, but..."  
  
I don't have the composure to turn around.  
  
I stop, still facing the exit.  
  
---  
  
"That incident you mentioned earlier. A woman was attacked when Matou Shinji still controlled Rider. She was saved thanks to you, but she would have died under normal circumstances."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I'm pissed.  
  
Somehow, I understand why he's bringing this up now.  
  
---  
  
"That's right. I need not mention who is at fault here. When Servants attack people, the responsibility lies on the Master."  
  
---  
  
"Are you saying Sakura's at fault?"  
  
"Of course not. I am only talking about the responsibility. I am not talking about good and evil. In reality, that woman is alive because of you."  
  
---  
  
――――But...  
  
If I made a wrong decision back then, Rider would've killed that woman.  
  
---  
  
That means――――  
  
"Yes, this is about the future.  
  
If Matou Sakura recovers, it will be the same in the end.  
  
The same thing is bound to happen again even if she regains her consciousness.  
  
Which one will you protect then?"  
  
---  
  
―――We don't know when Sakura might do the same thing.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I have nothing to say to him.  
  
I quickly make my way to the exit as if to run away from his words.  
  
---  
  
"Emiya Shirou. Do you remember why you became a Master?"  
  
---  
  
I grit my teeth and walk on.  
  
His words are an ultimatum.  
  
---  
  
"You said you would be a superhero.  
  
Then make your decision.  
  
Will you, or will you not cast aside your own desires like Emiya Kiritsugu―――to protect your ideal and your belief."  
  
---  
  
I shut the door.  
  
The door to God's house is heavy like the cross.  
  
---  
  
  
## Scene 28 What I should protect  
  
  
  
―――I smell rain.  
  
The plaza is empty, and no one is visiting the church.  
  
There...  
  
---  
  
Stands a man, waiting for me without his master.  
  
---  
  
"―――Archer."  
  
I strangely don't wonder....  
  
Why he's here and why he's waiting for me.  
  
---  
  
The red knight silently stares at me and closes his eyes once as if to part with something.  
  
"You know, right, Emiya Shirou?  
  
What you are fighting against, and who you must kill."  
  
---  
  
He clearly states the question I must answer.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
His words freeze my heart.  
  
...I know.  
  
I vowed to fight to stop the war, to stop Masters who involve innocent people.  
  
---  
  
That was my decision, and that's why I asked for Saber's help.  
  
I can't go back on my word.  
  
Then―――Sakura is the Master I should be stopping first.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I know, but I can't say anything.  
  
"――――――――"  
  
The knight in red remains silent.  
  
We stand there staring at each other under the gray sky.  
  
---  
  
"......Then do as you wish. My goal has changed. Now that the thing has appeared, it is not the time to be caring about personal grudges."  
  
"What......?"  
  
---  
  
"...This is a warning.  
  
If you're going to protect the belief you've had until now, that's fine.  
  
But―――if you choose another path, there will be no future for Emiya Shirou."  
  
"―――Does that mean I'm going to die?"  
  
---  
  
"If you equate self-imprisonment with death.  
  
Isn't that right? You have existed until now to let people live. How can you throw away that oath and discard everyone to save one person?"  
  
---  
  
His declaring words contain no scorn.  
  
Archer's words contain determination and emptiness.  
  
---  
  
"I don't know which path Emiya Shirou will choose.  
  
But if you are to deny everything you've done to save one person―――the crime will definitely judge you."  
  
---  
  
...Archer leaves.  
  
Unable to stop him, I start down the hill, paralyzed by indecision.  
  
---  
  
When I finally come back to myself, I'm sitting on the bench in the park.  
  
I don't feel like going home, and I can't wait at the church.  
  
---  
  
This park is far away from both.  
  
...It's been a few hours since I found out Sakura is a Master.  
  
Its location suits an indecisive guy like me.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
An answer.  
  
I have to come up with an answer, but my brain is so messed up that I can't even come up with what I should be thinking about.  
  
---  
  
―――She has suffered sexual abuse. It is easy to imagine what kind of training Matou Zouken imposed on her.  
  
To be blunt, Matou Sakura is not a pure virgin, but a woman who has known men―――  
  
---  
  
".........Shut... up."  
  
Don't repeat it. I understand.  
  
I'm a magus, even if I'm just an amateur.  
  
I know what it means, and I can tell what Sakura has been through――――  
  
---  
  
―――That girl tried to hide that fact from you, but always sought salvation. Someone who sat by, oblivious, has no right to care for her―――  
  
---  
  
"Shut up, shut up, shut up...! I know. You don't have to tell me such a thing――――!"  
  
...Such a thing...  
  
Why couldn't I notice it?  
  
---  
  
"......!"  
  
One of my back teeth cracks.  
  
I grit my teeth too much today. It's a wonder it didn't break until now.  
  
---  
  
"Damn――――Damn, damn, damn――――!"  
  
I grind on the bare nerves.  
  
Pain assails my brain.  
  
But it can't even drown out the hatred in my brain.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
A fire ignites inside my head.  
  
Now that I know the truth, thinking about our time together drives me crazy.  
  
---  
  
Sakura was smiling.  
  
She was always smiling gently.  
  
I never knew what kind of pain she went through, and I accepted her as a matter of course.  
  
---  
  
...I don't care if her smiles were real or fake.  
  
It makes me want to kill him, just thinking about what kind of pain was hidden behind her smiles.  
  
---  
  
"Matou Zouken――――!"  
  
I can't forgive him.  
  
I don't need recompensation. I want to eliminate him and remove him from Sakura's life.  
  
---  
  
Because everything is his fault.  
  
Sakura would've been able to live as a normal girl, and she would've never had a crest worm in her body if it wasn't for him.  
  
She wouldn't have become a Master, and Shinji wouldn't have lost himself if Zouken didn't exist.  
  
So...  
  
If he had never existed, none of this would've happened――――!  
  
---  
  
I punch the bench.  
  
The wound on my hand opens up, and blood drips down onto the white bench.  
  
The clear colors transfer into my head.  
  
---  
  
"How stupid―――what would've happened if he didn't exist?"  
  
I'm disgusted with my own foolishness.  
  
---  
  
"...That has nothing to do with this. Why am I pushing the responsibility onto someone else?"  
  
Why am I trying to make myself feel better?  
  
I won't deny what Matou Zouken has done to Sakura.  
  
Just thinking about it disgusts me. It makes me jealous, as if something important has been taken away.  
  
---  
  
But it doesn't lessen my guilt.  
  
I'm the one who didn't notice.  
  
No matter what Zouken did, it's my fault for not noticing.  
  
---  
  
"――――No. It's not that I didn't notice. I..."  
  
I just didn't try to notice.  
  
The night when I confronted Zouken.  
  
He said Sakura was unrelated, and I believed him.  
  
---  
  
...How stupid of me.  
  
Why did I believe his words?  
  
There's no way she'd be unrelated when she's of the Matou family.  
  
On the night I lost Saber, I realized Matou Zouken is a monster who doesn't care about other people's lives.  
  
---  
  
If that monster gave Rider to Shinji, there's no way he'd do nothing to Sakura.  
  
---  
  
But...  
  
I believed his words because they were convenient for me.  
  
---  
  
I could've easily realized it.  
  
It's something I could've guessed with even a little thought.  
  
...That's why I wasn't surprised.  
  
I knew it was obvious when I found out Sakura's a Master and that she's been raped until now.  
  
But I didn't think about it because I couldn't keep going if I realized it.  
  
---  
  
If I realized, I'd have to fight.  
  
If Matou Zouken is evil...  
  
The superhero has to fight against him.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
...No.  
  
It's clear what I must do.  
  
If Sakura is going to be Zouken's puppet and use Rider to indiscriminately attack people, it's clear what I must do.  
  
---  
  
That's why I learned magecraft.  
  
I've been able to live because I have to save people from unreasonable disasters.  
  
---  
  
"――――!"  
  
So it's clear.  
  
It's just like that red knight said.  
  
---  
  
―――Senpai. If I become a bad person―――  
  
---  
  
I don't want to hurt Sakura, and I feel sympathy.  
  
But there can be no exceptions.  
  
No matter how important it is to me, if it would create a disaster like that time...  
  
---  
  
―――Yes. I wouldn't mind if you do so.  
  
---  
  
"Uh――――, guh......!"  
  
...I just need to eliminate it.  
  
I shouldn't have to think twice, so why...  
  
"Haa――――, uh, guh――――!"  
  
Why am I desperately trying to keep myself from throwing up...?  
  
---  
  
"Ah――――haa... haa, haa, haa――――"  
  
I endure the nausea.  
  
...How long has it been?  
  
I don't have time to be worrying about stupid things.  
  
Tohsaka said she'd be back when the surgery ends.  
  
The town smells like rain.  
  
I have to go back to the church before it starts raining, find out how Sakura's doing, and――――  
  
---  
  
"Let's play, Shirou!"  
  
I'm suddenly embraced from behind.  
  
---  
  
"...Illya."  
  
I can tell without turning around.  
  
The one I meet at this park is always this white girl.  
  
---  
  
"Heehee, were you surprised? I had to greet you because I saw you."  
  
Illya laughs cheerfully.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
Her innocence is painful right now.  
  
I know it's selfish of me, but I don't want anyone smiling in front of me right now.  
  
---  
  
"Oh. What's going on, Shirou? Why are you ignoring me? It's rude to keep looking down when a girl's talking to you."  
  
"......"  
  
...I wish she'd be quiet.  
  
I don't have the composure to talk with someone right now.  
  
---  
  
"Humph. Hey, Shirou! You have to listen when people talk to you!"  
  
"......Illya. I'm sorry, but I can't afford to do so right now.  
  
If you want to play, you'll have to do it by yourself."  
  
---  
  
"What? I got to see you, so that's boring.  
  
You never came here after that day. If I let you go today, I bet you won't come again."  
  
---  
  
"...I didn't promise to meet you here every day. And it's night already. Don't Masters kill each other at night?"  
  
---  
  
My unkind words bring a renewed wave of nausea.  
  
...I hate myself so much that I want to punch myself.  
  
I'm driving Illya away so that I can be at ease.  
  
---  
  
"Why? You're not a Master anymore, right? So I'm going to let you go for tonight."  
  
"――――'I'm not a Master anymore'... Illya?"  
  
---  
  
"Hah. There's nothing I don't know about. You lost Saber, and Rin was almost defeated by Rider. But Rider's Master collapsed, so there are only two more left."  
  
Illya speaks cheerfully.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
It looks like she knows about Sakura's condition and...  
  
---  
  
"It's obvious now who's going to win. Rider's Master will self-destruct, and Archer isn't a big deal.  
  
No one can beat my Berserker now that Saber's gone.  
  
See, so let's play! You're not a Master anymore, so I'll specially invite you to my castle!"  
  
---  
  
Illya hugs me without reserve.  
  
Seeing her innocent smile makes me so angry that...  
  
"Shut up...! I said I don't have such time! Go play by yourself if you want to play around!"  
  
"Kya...!?"  
  
I push Illya away in a fit of rage.  
  
---  
  
"Oh―――――――"  
  
―――It's too late to regret what I've done.  
  
Illya is standing there in shock.  
  
I can tell without looking how shocking that must've been for her.  
  
---  
  
...I have pushed aside an honest, pure show of affection.  
  
It's like a parent rejecting a child.  
  
I have just ruined everything Illya felt for me.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
She stares at me in silence.  
  
---  
  
"......"  
  
Unable to hold her gaze, I look down―――  
  
"I'm sorry, Shirou."  
  
A small hand pats my head.  
  
---  
  
"...What?"  
  
I raise my head again.  
  
Illya is looking at me with a worried expression.  
  
---  
  
"......Illya. Aren't you going to get mad?"  
  
"No. You're about to cry, Shirou. I don't know what happened, but it'd be too bad for you if I hate you. So I'll be your ally no matter what you do."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
My vision is covered in white.  
  
...It's just one phrase.  
  
But that phrase washes everything away from my head.  
  
---  
  
"My... ally――――?"  
  
"Yeah. It's natural to protect the ones you love, right?  
  
Even I know that."  
  
---  
  
Someone's ally.  
  
Illya easily tells me the motive to be on someone's side.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
...I know what's right and what's wrong.  
  
What I've protected until now, and what I want to protect right now.  
  
I know which choice is correct, and which is wrong.  
  
With that in mind, I――――  
  
---  
  
## Scene 29 Superhero  
  
  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I know what's right.  
  
The thing that keeps me alive.  
  
I can't turn my back on the thing that has kept me alive.  
  
---  
  
"―――I'm sorry, Illya. I can't follow such an obvious thing."  
  
I turn my mind into steel.  
  
That's it.  
  
The gastric juice coming up my throat, the pain in my stomach, and the tears in eyes. Everything stops.  
  
---  
  
I can't let my conviction waver.  
  
For the sake of everyone who could not be saved, I can't let any more people share in their fate.  
  
---  
  
"...I see. So you're choosing the same method as Kiritsugu. You're going to cast away the person you love most for people you don't even know about."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
The man who turned away from the Einzberns for something he believed was right.  
  
I've chosen the same path.  
  
Illya has been betrayed twice now.  
  
Not choosing Sakura also means not choosing Illya.  
  
---  
  
"That's right. Kiritsugu and I are the same. If you want to curse someone, you can curse me."  
  
My mind has turned into hard steel.  
  
Getting scorned or cursed is not heavy for me at all.  
  
---  
  
The silver-haired girl doesn't say anything.  
  
I have denied her wish, so now would be the time to take her revenge on Kiritsugu.  
  
But...  
  
---  
  
"I pity you, Shirou.  
  
You're going to be deceiving yourself forever with that crying face of yours."  
  
---  
  
Illya tells me goodbye with a fading smile.  
  
---  
  
It starts to rain.  
  
There's no one in the park.  
  
It should be over at the church by now.  
  
---  
  
―――I open the door.  
  
Tohsaka is already here, standing in the corner of the chapel.  
  
She's not sitting down but standing there, and I can see her determination.  
  
She has the cold face of a magus, saying Sakura will be her enemy if the crest worm isn't removed.  
  
---  
  
"......"  
  
Tohsaka doesn't look at me, and I have nothing to say to her either.  
  
―――The sound of rain echoes inside the chapel.  
  
How long was it?  
  
---  
  
"The operation is complete. There is nothing more I can do."  
  
Breaking the deep silence, Kotomine Kirei appears.  
  
---  
  
"........So, how's Sakura, Kirei?"  
  
"I have done my best. That is all I can say."  
  
The result is as expected.  
  
There was never a chance that Sakura could be saved.  
  
---  
  
"Matou Sakura is sleeping. She should wake up tomorrow morning.  
  
What will you do as the successor of the Tohsaka family, Rin?"  
  
"――――I don't even need to say it. It's the supervisor's duty to eliminate a magus who has turned into a heretic. All the more so if the magus is a relative of mine."  
  
---  
  
The back of the chapel.  
  
Tohsaka walks on, probably heading to the room Sakura's sleeping in.  
  
---  
  
"―――Aren't you going to stop me, Emiya-kun?"  
  
Tohsaka turns back to me at the door.  
  
I reply with silence.  
  
---  
  
"So you won't mind even if I kill Sakura?"  
  
"I have nothing to say. But――――if I can take your place, I will."  
  
"No. This is my role. I can't give you this role."  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka opens the door and disappears inside.  
  
"I'm surprised. I thought you would stop her."  
  
"――――――――"  
  
"...Hm. It seems you are determined.  
  
The Holy Grail War will now return to normal. This is a bit disappointing, but I am looking forward to the end."  
  
---  
  
"...What's there to look forward to? Are you predicting who will win?"  
  
"Predict? There is no need to predict.  
  
―――You will win.  
  
Since you have cast away Matou Sakura, you will use any means possible to kill Matou Zouken, Illyasviel, and Rin. I am saying I am looking forward to how this will end."  
  
---  
  
"...Why? I won't fight Tohsaka. There's no reason for me to stop her, even if she's going to obtain the Holy Grail."  
  
---  
  
"You will fight her. You will be forced to fight her when you find out about the true identity of the Holy Grail. Having killed Matou Sakura, Rin will go mad unless she obtains the Holy Grail.  
  
She will try to win for her belief, and you will try to destroy the Holy Grail for your ideal.  
  
You two are incompatible with each other now. You two shall act out the final stage of the Holy Grail War."  
  
---  
  
The priest leaves the chapel as well.  
  
...The room Sakura and Tohsaka are in.  
  
He knows what happened there is already over.  
  
---  
  
"Are you saying I will remain until the very end?"  
  
"Of course. You are Emiya Kiritsugu now. There is no way you cannot win."  
  
---  
  
...The priest has left.  
  
The only one in the chapel is Emiya Shirou, with a mind of steel.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
The priest's words are true.  
  
I will continue fighting, defeat Zouken, Illya, and Tohsaka, and destroy the Holy Grail.  
  
---  
  
That is the end of this war.  
  
That is the responsibility I took when I swore to be a superhero.  
  
It is the first price I have to pay to become my ideal.  
  
---  
  
There's no need to talk about the obvious outcome.  
  
Emiya Shirou will turn his mind to steel,  
  
and become a superhero.  
  
---

This is one result.

........................................................................Idiot.

## Scene 31 Run into the rain  
  
  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I'm sure I'll regret it if I lie to myself and keep going.  
  
---  
  
Where the responsibility lies, existence of good and evil.  
  
Losing Sakura will weigh more heavily on me than either of those things.  
  
...I don't even need to think about it.  
  
I just want to protect Sakura, that's all.  
  
---  
  
"―――Yeah. It's a matter of course to protect the girl you like. Even I know that, Illya."  
  
"Right? I'm your ally because you're that kind of person."  
  
---  
  
Illya smiles delightedly.  
  
"――――――――"  
  
Her innocence encourages me.  
  
...I don't know if this is the right choice or not.  
  
But I do know I won't regret it.  
  
---  
  
"I'm sorry, Illya. I have to get going."  
  
"Yeah. I'll forgive you since you have that expression. Let's meet again, Shirou."  
  
"Yeah. See ya, Illya. And thank you."  
  
---  
  
I leave the park.  
  
I start running to the church as if to shake off my doubts.  
  
---  
  
「――――――――」  
  
...My answer's determined.  
  
I don't know how much Sakura supported me after my father died.  
  
---  
  
The girl I tried to see as just another fellow student.  
  
I kept on deceiving myself because I wanted her to stay by my side.  
  
But such deception will no longer work.  
  
---  
  
―――Emiya Shirou does not want to lose Matou Sakura.  
  
That's all.  
  
If I can't think things through, I'll just have to trust in the only definite feeling I have.  
  
---  
  
...But within my determination...  
  
'If you are to protect just one person――'  
  
---  
  
...I can't shake off Archer's premonitory words.  
  
---  
  
Rain starts.  
  
The winter rain mercilessly shoots down at me as I run.  
  
---  
  
## Scene 32 Intermission Bailing hand  
  
  
  
...Dragging sounds.  
  
These sounds are familiar.  
  
They are the sounds of crawling worms.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
This place is familiar as well.  
  
The dark, damp, secret room.  
  
An underground mausoleum.  
  
This green room is the first room given to her after she was adopted by the Matou family.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
A lone figure stands in the center of the room.  
  
...It may not be human, but its appearance is that of a human.  
  
This figure called for her, commanding her to fight in Matou Shinji's place.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
She was prepared for this.  
  
At the very least, she accepted the possibility up until two days ago.  
  
But now her determination is gone.  
  
Once she discovered that Emiya Shirou is a Master, her will to fight left her.  
  
---  
  
She visited the Emiya household to keep watch over him.  
  
But Emiya Shirou did not have the aptitude to become a Master, and he had no knowledge of the Holy Grail War.  
  
That fact became clear at once. Thus, there was never a reason to keep watch over him.  
  
She stayed as his underclassman, using the role of keeping watch over him as an excuse.  
  
---  
  
She had an optimistic view that there would be no need to fight him.  
  
Although she knew her true identity may be revealed at some point, she never dreamed that they would end up fighting one another.  
  
So―――how did it come to this?  
  
---  
  
"...Grandfather. Do all Masters need to be killed?"  
  
---  
  
She knows what the old man's reply is going to be.  
  
She knows, but she can only ask.  
  
But...  
  
"Well. You can keep one or two as playthings, if you like. All I want is their Servants. After stealing them, you may turn the Masters into your toys or puppets."  
  
The old man's answer is not what she expected.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――What...?"  
  
---  
  
"Do you not understand? I said there is no need to kill all the Masters. We will eliminate those that are dangerous to keep alive, but those who will not be obstacles can be spared.  
  
It is the wish of my cute granddaughter, so I shall be a bit flexible, even if this is our greatest desire."  
  
---  
  
Hearing his words, she lowers her guard a bit.  
  
...The old man becomes strangely kind sometimes.  
  
When teaching her the family's magecraft, he is an inhuman monster, as cruel as a beast.  
  
But sometimes, when they are talking, he becomes just a good-natured old man.  
  
---  
  
"......"  
  
---  
  
But she cannot be deceived.  
  
She does not know if this is a whim or a calculated act of kindness. Moreover, she knows she will end up fighting him if she agrees.  
  
Even if she does not have to kill him, just having to fight him is bad enough.  
  
---  
  
"Is that still not enough? ...My, you are a troubling one. That cowardice will prevent you from ever obtaining what you desire. Look, this is a good opportunity. If you want something, take it by force.  
  
Sakura. How long do you plan to remain a mere watcher? Reach out and claim your desire. You have the power and the right."  
  
---  
  
"......"  
  
---  
  
She does not answer.  
  
First of all, there is nothing she wants.  
  
She admires him, but she would never expect him to accept her.  
  
---  
  
She is impure. She is not suited for him.  
  
So someone more appropriate should stand next to him.  
  
All she wanted was to be by his side until that time came.  
  
It'll all be ruined if she wishes for anything more.  
  
...Not only her...  
  
He, too, will come to a bad end.  
  
---  
  
"...Grandfather. I cannot fight. I will give Rider to Nii-san."  
  
---  
  
She speaks with a trembling voice, prepared for re-education.  
  
She knows what awaits her for disobeying him.  
  
The fear of being thrown to the worms, of losing one's sensation, is something one can never get used to.  
  
The longest she was able to keep her sanity was two hours.  
  
She almost goes crazy, thinking that she will have to endure many times that, no, at worst until the Holy Grail War ends.  
  
---  
  
"......"  
  
---  
  
Her body trembles.  
  
Fear of punishment makes her want to scream.  
  
...But it is not the pain that she fears.  
  
All she fears is...  
  
...That when the pain becomes unbearable, she will do as he commands.  
  
---  
  
".........Hm. It cannot be helped, I suppose. I cannot force you and lose my valuable successor. I shall remain an observer as well in this war."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
---  
  
She gasps.  
  
She does not know how serious he is, but he has accepted her excuse.  
  
The trembling goes away, replaced by a warm sense of relief.  
  
---  
  
―――But into that defenseless mind...  
  
"But it is a bit disappointing. Looking at all the Masters in this war, the daughter of Tohsaka is looking pretty good. The unlikely might happen if luck favors her."  
  
...Enters the old man's disappointed voice.  
  
---  
  
"――――Nee-san is?"  
  
---  
  
Evil enters at that time.  
  
She knows it intuitively.  
  
Nee-san will certainly win. She is that kind of a person. She obtains everything she wants and passes through as if it's natural.  
  
...Nee-san will take everything she wants without even a glance towards her, the one standing in place.  
  
Then――――Nee-san will win.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
---  
  
Her body turns cold as ice.  
  
...She doesn't care about that.  
  
She's used to it.  
  
She's used to it.  
  
She's used to it.  
  
―――She's used to such treatment.  
  
---  
  
Nee-san will take it all.  
  
Nee-san is going to eliminate everything, the pain she went through, the bright future ahead of her, and the only person she can rely on――――  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
---  
  
...The ground wavers beneath her.  
  
The words make her dizzy and nauseous.  
  
...Her chest is hurting.  
  
Something unpleasant assails her.  
  
...As if a needle is in her chest.  
  
---  
  
...It has started raining.  
  
The chilly winter rain mercilessly beats against the gutters.  
  
---  
  
"―――――――"  
  
She slowly opens her eyes.  
  
...It seems she was dreaming about what happened a few days ago.  
  
She is sleeping on an operating table in a room made of stone.  
  
In front of her is a black priest she has never seen before.  
  
---  
  
"You are finally awake. Do I need to explain to you what is going on, Matou Sakura?"  
  
".........No. It's my body. I know all about it."  
  
She answers simply.  
  
She does not focus on him, but on the sound of the rain against the walls.  
  
---  
  
"All right. Then get changed quickly. Tohsaka Rin and Emiya Shirou are waiting in the next room. We have to explain your situation to them. You cannot run after that if you are naked, right?"  
  
"......Are you going to let me run away?"  
  
"That is your decision. I merely helped you. It is not for me to plan your actions for you.  
  
Well, it was a waste for me to save you if you die. I do want you to remain until the very end, though."  
  
---  
  
"...Why is that?"  
  
"It is more fun that way. Tohsaka Rin and Emiya Shirou will suffer more if you live. It is delightful the more sufferers there are."  
  
The priest turns his back after he answers.  
  
The priest will go to the chapel now.  
  
He does not look back at her, hugging her knees on the operating table.  
  
---  
  
"Well. Will they kill you, or will they let you live? You may wait here if you are interested in their decision. Though it does not look it, this building has a flimsy structure. For some reason, you can hear all the conversation going on in the chapel."  
  
He smiles and leaves.  
  
---  
  
"......Senpai. What should I do?"  
  
She embraces her knees.  
  
The quiet weeping is drowned out by the sound of rain.  
  
---  
  
  
  
  
## Scene 33 Set position  
  
  
  
―――I open the door.  
  
Tohsaka is already here, standing in the corner of the chapel.  
  
She's not sitting down but standing there, and I can see her determination.  
  
She has the cold face of a magus, saying Sakura will be her enemy if the crest worm isn't removed.  
  
---  
  
"......"  
  
Tohsaka doesn't look at me, and I have nothing to say to her either.  
  
―――The sound of rain echoes inside the chapel.  
  
How long has it been?  
  
---  
  
"The operation is complete. There is nothing more I can do."  
  
Breaking the deep silence, Kotomine Kirei appears.  
  
---  
  
"Eh――――hey, Kirei. What happened to your Magic Crest?"  
  
"Hm, you can tell? As you can see, I used all of it on Matou Sakura's treatment."  
  
"―――Y-You used it all?"  
  
Tohsaka is astonished.  
  
---  
  
"......?"  
  
I don't get it.  
  
All I can tell is that something happened to Kotomine's Magic Crest, and Tohsaka is surprised about it.  
  
---  
  
"D-Do you understand? We're talking about a Magic Crest here!  
  
Why does something you built up for generations go away in just a few hours...!?"  
  
---  
  
"It could not be helped. The Crest I received from my father is not permanent, like the one you have. It is a consumption type that goes away the more I use it. We have never been a family of magi to begin with.  
  
You can think of it as a lower-rank Command Spell."  
  
---  
  
"――――Then you really..."  
  
"Yes. I've used up all of it for the treatment. It was the extraction of an eleven-year old pus. It should not be surprising that it took all of my remaining Crest."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
...We both gasp.  
  
The priest is saying he used all of his Magic Crest to treat Sakura.  
  
Tohsaka's expression tells me how valuable the compensation was.  
  
Kotomine threw away all of his fortune for Sakura.  
  
---  
  
"...Kotomine."  
  
"What? Do not tell me it's troubling for you. You two are the ones who told me to save her. I merely answered your wish."  
  
---  
  
"Oh... no. It's not troubling at all. ...Um, thank you."  
  
"Do not thank me. You will take it back later anyway."  
  
"――――Take it back later...?"  
  
Does that mean――――  
  
---  
  
"So, how's Sakura? You did that much, so――――"  
  
---  
  
"She escaped death, but it is just temporary.  
  
I was able to remove most of the crest worm, but some parts were buried too deeply to be removed. Some of it has eaten into the nerves. I can extract it all if I remove her heart, but that will kill Sakura as well."  
  
---  
  
"All I could do was to remove the crest worm that did not metabolize with her nerves, decreasing her pain and the pressure from Zouken. Her life should have ended tonight, but I prolonged it on a whim. Well, it will all be vain effort if the worm in her nerves start moving again."  
  
---  
  
"Wha――――then Sakura is..."  
  
"It means nothing has changed.  
  
She will have no problem living normally, but Zouken can easily drive her berserk.  
  
That old man can force her to fight, whether she wants to or not. In short, she is a bomb with a lit fuse."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I'd be lying if I said I'm not agitated.  
  
But I'm not surprised or puzzled.  
  
I've made my decision already.  
  
I chose to be on Sakura's side, no matter what happens, no matter what state she's in.  
  
---  
  
"I see. Then there's only one thing left to do. I'm sorry for making you use you Crest."  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka starts to walk.  
  
I instantly understand what she's going to do.  
  
"Hey, stop, Tohsaka...!"  
  
I grab Tohsaka's hand and stop her.  
  
---  
  
"What? Talk to me later."  
  
"What are you saying? Are you planning to kill Sakura?"  
  
"Hey, it's something that has to be done. Didn't you come here, prepared for that?"  
  
---  
  
  
## Scene 34 Geas  
  
  
  
"I'm not prepared for such a thing. I came back for Sakura."  
  
"――――!"  
  
---  
  
"―――I see. I get your point.  
  
You're going to protect Sakura over other people, right?"  
  
"Yeah. Don't say I'm mistaken. If you're going to kill Sakura, I'll stop you."  
  
---  
  
"Stop me? I think not. You can't even move an inch, let alone stop me. You can't interfere, no matter how badly you want to protect her."  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka's voice contains no emotion.  
  
And...  
  
"Wh―――at......?"  
  
...I try to react and realize that I can't even move a finger.  
  
---  
  
"Guh...!? Tohsaka, you...!"  
  
"...You said I can't say you're mistaken. But you did make a mistake. If you wanted to follow your own path, you shouldn't have given me the right to decide."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
My heart beats loudly.  
  
No, it's not my heart, but the bind made right beside my heart.  
  
---  
  
―――It's nothing.  
  
It was an ideal answer.  
  
I'm not satisfied, but if that's what you say, that's how it'll be.  
  
---  
  
"――――――Curse of coercion..."  
  
---  
  
"Yes. It was just horseplay, but I never thought it would come in handy like this. You can't go against me from the moment you swore absolute obedience to me.  
  
...You made a contract with me instead of making a promise. Instead of being my ally, you chose to be my servant."  
  
---  
  
"Wha――――"  
  
"―――I'm going to go kill Sakura, Emiya-kun. But don't get it wrong. You couldn't have stopped me even if you didn't have the geas.  
  
This is my duty. You're not at fault here."  
  
---  
  
"――――! Tohsaka, w――――"  
  
I can't even tell her to wait.  
  
---  
  
...Tohsaka leaves.  
  
"No way――――why?"  
  
I still can't move.  
  
---  
  
"Damn, don't kid me! Why――――!?"  
  
I struggle with all my might.  
  
I have to free myself quickly.  
  
I fight the binding, hoping that it's not too late.  
  
---  
  
And suddenly, I'm free once again.  
  
---  
  
"―――――――"  
  
My feet won't move to follow her.  
  
Though I've been freed, I'm still frozen in place.  
  
―――And then I understand.  
  
My body stopped moving when I defied Tohsaka.  
  
Then...  
  
Have I been freed because there's no longer a need to hold me here?  
  
---  
  
"――――――Sakura."  
  
My legs give way.  
  
Without a place to go, my mind breaks.  
  
---  
  
My vision loses light and stains the church black.  
  
―――Emiya Shirou is in weightlessness.  
  
I threw away my previous ideal to protect Sakura.  
  
It's a new path that I can't yield to anyone.  
  
But I've already lost the person on whom I'd depended.  
  
---  
  
―――The fight will continue.  
  
The Holy Grail War will continue, and I will end the war along with Tohsaka, the one who killed Sakura.  
  
---  
  
...But that is no longer my concern.  
  
Emiya Shirou's position has been eternally lost.  
  
From now on, I must continue onward with neither a guide nor a goal――――

Yeah. Man, these contracts sure are scary.  
  
They pull your leg when it counts, even when you don't mean it.  
  
---  
  
Don't get tricked by such sales, okay, everyone?  
  
The scariest things are always right next to you where you don't expect them.  
  
---  
  
Right, Illya-chan!?  
  
---  
  
...? Stop it, that's embarrassing.  
  
I don't know why, but I feel bashful if you stare at me so much.  
  
---  
  
See, isn't she scary?  
  
So, the cause of this death is your contract with Tohsaka-san.  
  
---  
  
She makes unreasonable demands of you, but there is one thing you should not say "yes" to.  
  
Try starting over from the beginning of day 9.  
  
---  
  
Osu! And I also hear that her affection point goes up if you go against one of her questions!  
  
---  
  
Oh, as expected from the heroine (candidate) returning from the main storyline!  
  
You have awesome information.  
  
---  
  
Ugh... I thought we promised not to say that...  
  
---  
  
Well, this is the last Tiger Dojo in day 9.  
  
---  
  
What lies ahead is a hell filled with dead ends!  
  
Face the battles with care!  
  
---  
  
See ya!  
## Scene 36 Sisters(II)  
  
  
  
"I'm not prepared for such a thing. I came back for Sakura.  
  
If you're going to kill her, then I'll stop you."  
  
"――――!"  
  
---  
  
"Then what are you going to do...!?  
  
Look, Sakura can't live unless she fights as a Master.  
  
She has to absorb other people's magical energy to survive...!  
  
Don't you see how this will end!? Killing her here is for her own good...!"  
  
---  
  
"...No way! Why are you jumping to conclusions when she hasn't done anything yet!"  
  
---  
  
"How could I not? If this were just about Sakura, there'd be hope. But it's not, is it? That damn old man holds her life, and she's his puppet as long as he lives.  
  
Do you think he's ever going to let her go?"  
  
"――――That's..."  
  
---  
  
"See, you understand. Zouken will never give her a moment's peace. ...Then... If she's going to go through endless torment with no hope of escape, all we can do is kill her here and minimize the number of victims. Sakura and all the people Sakura will kill would be saved."  
  
---  
  
"Unlike you, I can't endanger everyone while clinging to a forlorn hope. The weakness to delay your decision is going to hurt her even more."  
  
"――――――――"  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka's right.  
  
It's not that death itself is salvation, but if our goal is to save people, her solution is the best.  
  
Any other idea would just be a selfish mistake.  
  
---  
  
Ten people will die if we don't do anything.  
  
But if we can save nine by sacrificing one, then――――  
  
―――That's...  
  
The reality I have always tried to deny, but have known deep within my heart to be true.  
  
---  
  
"――――No. You're mistaken."  
  
"Emiya... kun?"  
  
"I won't let there be any victims.  
  
You're the weak one, jumping to conclusions before even trying."  
  
---  
  
"D-Don't kid me...! Do you know what that means!? Save Sakura? What does that mean!? Are you going to save both her and the people she's going to kill!? Don't make me laugh! You can't do such a thing alone...!"  
  
---  
  
"――――No, I can't. But I'm going to protect Sakura. I'll think about what the result may be starting now."  
  
---  
  
"―――! I see, then you're my enemy.  
  
...Let go of me. Or you're going to be blown away."  
  
"――――Go ahead. But Tohsaka, don't think everything will go your way."  
  
---  
  
...Our hands tighten on each other.  
  
Mine is from tension.  
  
Tohsaka's is―――well, I want to believe hers is because of tension too.  
  
It's give-and-take, but we can't back down because we both have things we believe in and――――  
  
---  
  
"What the...!?"  
  
"What...!?"  
  
Outside the chapel.  
  
We hear the sound from the next room and exchange looks.  
  
---  
  
"Did you hear that, Emiya-kun...?"  
  
"――――A window broke. And after that..."  
  
---  
  
"Running footsteps. The only ways out of here are through this chapel or the back door. What is she doing, breaking the window to go outside?  
  
...Oh, I see. Most windows here have fixed fittings.  
  
She had to break it to get out. For someone who's still recovering, she's pretty violent."  
  
---  
  
"Recovering――――do you mean Sakura!?"  
  
"Who else? From the room she was in, you can somehow hear everything said in the chapel. I am sure she fled when she heard you discuss killing her."  
  
---  
  
"Wha-"  
  
"Forgive me. It is a structural defect."  
  
"Don't lie, you fake priest...! I'm sure it's intentional!"  
  
---  
  
Tohsaka shakes off my hand and starts running.  
  
She runs not to the room, but to the door leading outside.  
  
---  
  
"Tohsaka――――!"  
  
"We'll talk later! Finding Sakura comes first! Geez, where is she going to go in her condition...!?"  
  
She quickly opens the door and runs outside.  
  
Tohsaka goes into the rain without an umbrella.  
  
---  
  
"――――!"  
  
I don't have any time to lose either.  
  
I don't know where Sakura went, but she can't be left by herself now――――!  
  
---  
  
"Wait. I do not mind if you plan to search for Matou Sakura, but there is something I forgot to tell you."  
  
"――――What? I don't have time for one of your long speeches...!"  
  
"Do not say that. This is important. I will be troubled if I do not tell you. Rin ran off without listening to me, so I need to tell somebody. Do I not?"  
  
---  
  
"...Is this about Sakura?"  
  
"Yes. She does not have long to live.  
  
The crest worm continues to corrupt her body as we speak.  
  
It is easy to extract it, but her body would never withstand the shock. It's like pulling out four-tenths of her nerves. She would die as a human being before the pain caused her to die of shock."  
  
---  
  
"But leaving her alone will lead to the same result.  
  
The loss of magical energy is slowly eroding her sanity. Soon she will lose all sense of self. Once that happens, she will be nothing more than a rampaging Master.  
  
She will sacrifice many people to maintain her Servant, and when the strain becomes too much to bear, she will self-destruct.  
  
―――In short, you cannot save that woman, no matter what you do."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I feel dizzy, as though I'm looking into a strobe lamp.  
  
---  
  
"Broken things do not repair themselves, and lost things never return. If you wanted to save her, you should have done so eleven years ago.  
  
Do you still intend to save her, Emiya Shirou?  
  
She will die in the next few days no matter what we do. Is there a meaning in saving such a person?"  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I can't breathe.  
  
I can barely stand under the impact of his words.  
  
---  
  
"...I don't know anything about that. But you saved Sakura. Isn't that reason enough?"  
  
"Well. I only treated her out of duty. I cannot turn away someone who came seeking help."  
  
---  
  
"――――Don't lie. You wouldn't use up your Magic Crest just out of duty. I don't know why, but you wanted to save Sakura.  
  
You didn't want to let her die. I feel the same way too."  
  
I glare at the priest.  
  
...He must understand, because he nods slightly.  
  
---  
  
"Yes. Then hurry. Rin will surely kill Matou Sakura if she finds her first. Provide that lost child with shelter before that happens."  
  
He doesn't need to tell me.  
  
Turning my back to him, I follow Tohsaka into the rain.  
  
---  
  
――――My breath is white.  
  
Under the cold winter rain, my breath seems to freeze and blow back against my face.  
  
---  
  
"――――Sakura."  
  
There's no one on the road.  
  
The street lamps light up the night in vain, and I run without aim.  
  
...I'm going to find Sakura.  
  
It's not just the premonition that something terrible is going to happen if I don't find her quickly.  
  
I just want to hold her hand right now and feel her warmth.  
  
---  
  
"Haa――――Haa, ha――――"  
  
I run blindly.  
  
I don't know where she went.  
  
...Sakura no longer has any place to go.  
  
There's no place for her at my house nor at the Matou household. She has to be wandering in the night.  
  
---  
  
"...She shouldn't have gone far. If you needed to find shelter where there weren't any people――――"  
  
It's a wild guess.  
  
But the only thing I can do right now is to check every one of the possibilities――――  
  
---  
  
"Ha, haa, ha――――ah."  
  
I cross the bridge.  
  
Sakura wasn't around the Shinto station, and I didn't hear anything about a girl like Sakura being there.  
  
---  
  
Even though it's night, it's not so late that places will be deserted.  
  
There weren't many, but I saw a few people walking about.  
  
But if none of them saw Sakura, maybe she avoided Shinto and went back to Miyama City.  
  
---  
  
She's probably still in her school uniform, so she would stand out in this rain.  
  
If she wanted to avoid attention, she would head to Miyama City―――and that's what I'm thinking as I run through the rain, when...  
  
---  
  
"――――――――Sakura."  
  
I come to a stop.  
  
Under the bridge.  
  
Sakura is standing alone on the dark, desolate, brick road.  
  
---  
  
I go down to the park.  
  
...Does she notice me?  
  
Sakura is looking down while exposing her body to the rain.  
  
"――――――――"  
  
...I can't think of anything to say to her.  
  
All I can do is take her home.  
  
---  
  
"Sakura."  
  
I call out to her as I approach.  
  
"No, please don't come...!"  
  
And...  
  
Sakura refuses with desperateness I've never seen before.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I stop.  
  
Sakura is still looking down, tightly clutching her skirt in her hands.  
  
She looks like a criminal mortified by her actions. It's heart-breaking.  
  
...I can't go any closer.  
  
I feel that I shouldn't until she raises her head.  
  
---  
  
"――――Sakura."  
  
"...Please go home.  
  
If you come near me right now――――I don't know what I'll do."  
  
---  
  
Her voice is shaking.  
  
She's trembling because of the cold rain and her feelings of guilt.  
  
...I can't erase them from her.  
  
All I can do is...  
  
"―――Let's go home. You haven't recovered from your cold yet, right?"  
  
...Extend my hands.  
  
---  
  
"...Senpai."  
  
Sakura's wet hair sways.  
  
Sakura bites her lips.  
  
"I can't go. Where can I go back to now?"  
  
Her voice is heavy with self-loathing.  
  
---  
  
"――――――Sakura."  
  
"It's fine, Senpai. You don't need to force yourself to care for me."  
  
---  
  
"...Because you know already, right? You heard what I am. You heard what's going on with my body, didn't you? Then――――this is..."  
  
...All over.  
  
Her white breath tells me the end of her sentence.  
  
---  
  
"――――Don't say such a stupid thing. What I heard is unimportant. The only Sakura I know is the one I've been with.  
  
So why does it have to end because of something like this?"  
  
---  
  
"...Because it will end.  
  
I'm not a virgin, Senpai. I was raped at the place I was adopted as a kid, and my first time was a long time ago. Not only that, my body has been continuously violated by unknown things."  
  
---  
  
Sakura's nails dig into her elbow.  
  
...It's a masochistic action as if punishing the dirty stains on her body.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
"That's not the only thing. I'm a magus of the Matou family, and I've been hiding that fact from you.  
  
...I didn't tell you when I became a Master, and I pretended not to know anything when you brought Saber-san over.  
  
Don't you see? It would've been so much more convenient. And you wouldn't get mad at me that way, right?"  
  
---  
  
"――――Sakura."  
  
---  
  
"But I'm really stupid. I shouldn't be able to deceive you, but I thought I could.  
  
I thought it's fine even if my grandfather's worm is in me. I thought I wouldn't lose if I held myself firm, but I easily lost.  
  
...The stuff that was splashed on me was just aphrodisiac. It's not poison or anything, but it makes my body more sensitive. That's all it took to make me go crazy and hurt you."  
  
---  
  
"...Tohsaka-Senpai is right. I'm a coward, I'm a crybaby, I'm selfish... I knew this was going to happen, but I couldn't disobey my grandfather or end it myself.  
  
I didn't want to be hurt or scared, and I value myself more than others, so I couldn't find the courage to kill myself...!"  
  
---  
  
...She's crying.  
  
Sakura is crying.  
  
She's crying and doesn't know what to do, which just makes her cry even harder.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
Feeling her pain, I regret what I've done.  
  
―――I have never seen her cry before.  
  
The reason behind those tears...  
  
Why didn't I realize sooner that she can only cry when condemning herself?  
  
---  
  
"Don't cry――――Sakura."  
  
---  
  
"You see――――everything is my fault.  
  
I'm just a puppet for my grandfather, and I could go crazy any minute now. Sooner or later I'll do something terrible. So where can such a person go, Senpai...!?"  
  
---  
  
Sakura corners herself.  
  
...Nobody is condemning her.  
  
That's why she has to do so herself.  
  
She has to say she's the evil one. She has to condemn herself and punish herself.  
  
---  
  
"―――――So, don't cry."  
  
---  
  
...Sakura once said it.  
  
That she's a coward who needs someone to lead her by force.  
  
I finally understand what she meant.  
  
---  
  
Someone I want to protect.  
  
Someone important to me.  
  
Someone I never thought I would lose.  
  
If I don't want her to cry anymore...  
  
I have to take her hand and lead her to a place in the sun, so I should now――――  
  
---  
  
"...I'm sorry, Senpai. I've been deceiving you all this time.  
  
I never really believed I deserved to be with you. Every day I thought about ending it all... just acting like a stranger from that day on.  
  
I'd just pass by you in the hallway, ignore you after school, go home alone at night, and forget everything that happened...!"  
  
---  
  
――――Oh.  
  
If she'd done that, I would've gone crazy.  
  
I'm sorry I didn't realize that.  
  
---  
  
"But I couldn't...! My body would tremble at the pure thought of it, and it was really frightening. It was scarier than the time I put a knife on my wrist, and I couldn't stop myself from going to your house. I was scared of deceiving you, scared to stop deceiving you, and everything around me was scary. I couldn't move at all, and I didn't know what to do...!"  
  
---  
  
But I believe this is for the best.  
  
Sakura says I should never have learned about this.  
  
But if that were the case, she would just have kept on crying.  
  
---  
  
"...I'm stupid, right? You would've eventually found out. But it's too late now, and I can never go back to your house. I thought every night that I should get away from you before it happened.  
  
It's for your own good, and I knew I would stop crying at night, but――――"  
  
---  
  
I can't let her cry anymore.  
  
If Sakura has to blame herself because nobody will blame her...  
  
---  
  
"But―――But I still wanted to hide it from you...!  
  
I wanted to protect my time with you...!  
  
That was the only meaningful thing for me, so why...!"  
  
---  
  
Even if nobody would forgive her, I would keep forgiving her in her place.  
  
---  
  
"Oh――――――――"  
  
I embrace her cold body.  
  
---  
  
...My arms are terribly unreliable.  
  
I can't hold her tightly, nor can I pull her close.  
  
...I can't save Sakura.  
  
I want her to be with me, and I can only stay by her side.  
  
---  
  
...Awkwardly, I wrap my arms around her.  
  
Even if this is all I can do right now, my determination is definite and firm.  
  
---  
  
"Senpai, I――――"  
  
"Don't cry. I understand you're a bad person now."  
  
"――――――――"  
  
---  
  
She gasps.  
  
Sakura is confused, torn between guilt and regret.  
  
To deny those feelings, I tell her what I truly feel.  
  
---  
  
"――――So I'll protect you. No matter what happens, even if you try to kill yourself――――I'll protect you, Sakura."  
  
"Sen... pai."  
  
"I promise. I'll be your superhero."  
  
---  
  
...I hold her a bit tighter.  
  
Even if it's just a touch,  
  
I do so to tell her that my oath is more firm than anything.  
  
---  
  
"......"  
  
How much effect did it have?  
  
The stubbornness flows out of Sakura, and her shoulders relax.  
  
---  
  
...No matter what she says, Sakura is still the same.  
  
Her sensation and her warmth are the same.  
  
Our breaths are white, and the pouring rain has turned to a drizzle.  
  
---  
  
In the freezing night...  
  
"No, Senpai――――I'll probably end up hurting you."  
  
Her words sound like a confession.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
The rain is stopping.  
  
The night is cold as midwinter, and Sakura doesn't try to free herself from my arms.  
  
...And...  
  
"I'm going to hurt you, Senpai, but――――"  
  
---  
  
――――I want to stay like this.  
  
A tear trickles down her cheek as she says it.  
  
---  
  
――――And with that, the choice is made.  
  
Something decisive has ended.  
  
---  
  
I don't know if this is love or not.  
  
But―――a premonition lingers in the back of my mind...  
  
Telling me that the end of this love will not be compensation.  
  
---  
  
## Scene 37 Connection of bodies  
  
  
  
The rain has completely stopped by the time we return to my house.  
  
...We've been holding hands ever since we left the park.  
  
We calmed down as we walked, and by the time we got to the hill, we were actually embarrassed, but in the end we didn't let go even for a moment.  
  
---  
  
"Huh......? The light at the door is on. Did you come back here, Sakura?"  
  
"...Um, I don't think it's me. It might be Fujimura-Sensei."  
  
---  
  
"Oh yeah."  
  
We go to the door, hand in hand.  
  
Her cold hand has become warm.  
  
I'm relieved to feel the warmth of her life, and I enter my house as if I've just come home from school.  
  
---  
  
"Welcome home. I know it was rude, but I came in without your permission."  
  
---  
  
"T-Tohsaka――――"  
  
"Nee...... Tohsaka-Senpai."  
  
---  
  
"Yes. I guessed you would come back here eventually, but I didn't think it was going to be both of you. ...Well, I thought it might be possible in your case."  
  
---  
  
"――――!"  
  
I quickly push Sakura behind me and confront Tohsaka.  
  
---  
  
"Tohsaka, you still...!"  
  
"Of course. I can't leave Matou Sakura alone as a magus of Tohsaka. The Association will be after me if I don't punish her as the supervisor of Fuyuki. It'll be too late then."  
  
---  
  
"I don't care about your circumstances. Sakura hasn't done anything yet. If you still want to do something to her, you'll have to silence me first."  
  
"You're right. You're a free magus that doesn't belong to the Association, so it might be good to discipline you here.  
  
I'm going to kill Sakura. I'll kill you too if you get in my way."  
  
---  
  
"......"  
  
My senses become alert.  
  
...Tohsaka's fingertip.  
  
Once it moves, that'll signal the start of the battle.  
  
---  
  
I'll escape outside with Sakura before Tohsaka can finish her spell.  
  
After that―――I'll decide what to do after that on the spot.  
  
For now, I'm going to concentrate on getting away from here.  
  
The difference in our skills.  
  
I can't even spare to think about what I might do against Archer, who should be here.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
Tohsaka's lips start to move.  
  
When I notice she's merely speaking, not casting a spell...  
  
"Stop, please stop, Nee-san...!"  
  
...Sakura jumps in between us.  
  
---  
  
"――――Sakura."  
  
"S-Senpai's right. So far, he's the only one I've hurt. So if he's forgiven me, I shouldn't be punished yet."  
  
---  
  
"――――Hey now. Do you really understand the state your body is in?  
  
How can you say that?"  
  
"...I can say it. I'm still fine.  
  
Are you serious, Tohsaka-Senpai? Senpai isn't a Master anymore. Saber-san's gone, and he's just my Senpai now, but you're saying you're going to kill him?  
  
---  
  
"――――Of course. It doesn't matter whether or not he's armed. If he's planning to get in my way, I'll have to dispose of him."  
  
---  
  
"――――Then. If you're still going to fight Senpai, I'm going to fight you. I won't lose to you as Rider's Master."  
  
Sakura is trembling, but she confronts Tohsaka with the utmost courage.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
...Is she surprised by Sakura's determination, or does she think it's disadvantageous to fight here?  
  
"I see. If you can say something like that, then fight on and win the war as a Master. Come to think of it, there is one way that you could be saved.  
  
You would easily be able to disenchant Zouken's bindings if you obtained the Holy Grail."  
  
---  
  
"Oh... Tohsaka-Senpai."  
  
"It's not that I'm letting you go.  
  
...We'll have our chance to fight as Masters. I'm just saying this isn't the appropriate place."  
  
---  
  
She passes by us.  
  
To my surprise, she doesn't show any enmity as she passes by.  
  
---  
  
"Tohsaka."  
  
"......Hmph. So our alliance only lasted a day, huh? We can't cooperate as long as you're protecting Sakura."  
  
"――――――――"  
  
---  
  
"But don't forget. We don't know when Sakura might run wild.  
  
It's your own fault if you die when that happens, but since you took her in, you'd better make sure you're the only victim."  
  
She leaves without turning around.  
  
---  
  
"...Senpai. Um, I..."  
  
"Don't look so worried, you idiot. That's her way of being ironic. It's her hobby to make fun of people."  
  
"......"  
  
---  
  
I do my best to cheer Sakura up as we go into the hallway.  
  
We're both freezing, so we should quickly get changed and warm ourselves up.  
  
---  
  
'...Since you took her in, you'd better make sure you're the only victim.'  
  
---  
  
That means that when she kills me, I have to kill her as well.  
  
Tohsaka left, leaving me with what I must do at the very least.  
  
"―――――――"  
  
...That will never happen.  
  
I keep convincing myself as we head to the living room.  
  
---  
  
...Our clasped hands are really warm.  
  
Sakura is here, alive.  
  
That's all I care about now.  
  
I can't make Sakura uneasy by worrying about other things, but...  
  
---  
  
"...Hm?"  
  
Wait.  
  
I think Sakura's hand is too warm.  
  
---  
  
"Sakura. Did your cold get worse again?"  
  
"Huh...? U-Um, how is it? Do I feel hot?"  
  
She must not know herself, as she asks me a strange question.  
  
---  
  
"No, it's not terribly hot, but you're warmer than me. It feels warm when I touch you."  
  
"Oh――――i-it's probably a cold...! I think I caught a cold because I was in the rain for so long."  
  
...?  
  
I don't know why, but Sakura lowers her head in embarrassment.  
  
---  
  
"I see, you're right. Then you have to hurry and get changed and warm your body up. I'll cook dinner, so you go check your temperature, and if it's high, you're to come back to the living room wearing something warm. I'll make sure to cook something that's easy to eat."  
  
---  
  
"Oh... N-No, I don't need dinner. Um, I'm going to bed, so you can rest as well...!"  
  
Sakura leaves in a hurry.  
  
---  
  
"...?"  
  
Oh well.  
  
I'll catch a cold too if I stand here like this, so I should take a bath and warm myself up.  
  
---  
  
## Scene 38 Connection of bodies [H]  
  
  
  
I finish taking the bath and return to my room.  
  
Now that I've changed out of my wet clothes, I finally feel like I'm home again.  
  
---  
  
"―――――――Phew."  
  
I sit down and let out a sigh while relaxing my shoulders.  
  
...Today was a long day.  
  
Many things happened, and there were many ups and downs.  
  
I sort out the things I've lost from those I still have.  
  
---  
  
"...Right. Sakura is Rider's Master."  
  
It seems Sakura had given her right to Shinji, but she is Rider's Master now.  
  
Then Rider must be nearby, protecting Sakura.  
  
---  
  
"...Yeah. I've seen Rider a few times already.  
  
If she'll be protecting Sakura, I have to go introduce myself to her properly."  
  
---  
  
...She's unapproachable because of her appearance, but I think she's understanding.  
  
I don't know when Sakura will be attacked by Zouken, so Rider is the only one I can rely on.  
  
---  
  
...Well, according to Kotomine, Sakura's condition will get worse the more she uses her Servant, so relying on Rider is a last resort.  
  
---  
  
"All right. I'll have Sakura introduce me to her tomorrow.  
  
Oh... but she might hold a grudge after losing to Saber."  
  
My shoulders slump.  
  
...But Rider will be living here too, so I should at least greet her――――  
  
---  
  
"――――Who is it!?"  
  
"......!"  
  
I raise myself so that I can jump back instantly and glare at the shouji.  
  
...Outside the room.  
  
...I can see the silhouette of someone standing on the porch.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
...There's no reply.  
  
The figure seems to be waiting for my reaction.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
...Damn.  
  
There's nothing I can use as a weapon here. I guess I'll have to attack first before――――  
  
---  
  
"――――S-Senpai. Um, are you awake...?"  
  
"Huh...? Oh, it's you, Sakura."  
  
I sit back down.  
  
...Man.  
  
She should've said something. What's wrong with her?  
  
---  
  
"What's up? You can use the bath whenever you like. If you need a change, there's Fuji-Nee's clothes, right?"  
  
"...Yes. I've already taken a bath and borrowed Fujimura-Sensei's clothes."  
  
---  
  
"...?"  
  
Now I'm really confused.  
  
I don't think there's anything else to ask.  
  
---  
  
"Um... Senpai. Can I come in?"  
  
"Yeah. Why are you being so formal?"  
  
The shouji opens.  
  
And the person entering the room is...  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
Sakura, in normal clothes, acting strangely.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I hear someone gulp.  
  
I realize that it's me and feel myself heating up.  
  
"Uh――――um..."  
  
I cover my mouth with my hand and look away.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
...This is bad.  
  
I looked away, but the urge to look at her is overwhelming.  
  
My heart's beating rapidly, and my head is so confused that it might run away unless I keep the reins on.  
  
---  
  
"――――"  
  
In short, I'm about to go crazy.  
  
I don't know why, but Sakura is unnaturally beautiful right now.  
  
---  
  
"......"  
  
Sakura just stands there.  
  
I finally realize that something else is strange.  
  
---  
  
"...Sakura? You're acting weird. How's your fever? Do you have a cold after all?"  
  
"...No. I do have a fever, but it's not because of a cold.  
  
It's not because I'm sick that I'm burning up."  
  
Sakura looks down awkwardly.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――!"  
  
The gesture almost makes me let go of the reins.  
  
---  
  
...Sakura acted like this from time to time over the last couple of days.  
  
I thought I'd grown used to noticing parts of her that I didn't know about, and that she's a girl my age.  
  
But... I think this is on a different level entirely.  
  
---  
  
"...Sakura?"  
  
"...It's no good, Senpai. I can't suppress it by myself any longer."  
  
Sakura blushes and tries to endure the embarrassment.  
  
---  
  
"W―――What can't you suppress?"  
  
"...It's exactly what you're thinking.  
  
...The worm in me is eating my magical energy and telling me it's not enough. ...It wants more. My body started to heat up just by holding your hand and thinking it's warm."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I can hear the heat in her unsteady words.  
  
Sakura is feeling embarrassment and something like joy from exposing her dark side.  
  
---  
  
"...You know, right, Senpai? I was trained as a magus at the Matou household. ...Grandfather tampered with my body so that he could turn a child of another bloodline into a magus of the Matou family."  
  
---  
  
"...The result is this lewd body that desires men. ...My body heats up and goes crazy unless I get semen from a magus."  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
...I get dizzy.  
  
I don't know when I entered another dimension. but the room itself starts to warp and laugh.  
  
---  
  
But I'm the one who's strange.  
  
I should be angry at Zouken, but I can only stare at Sakura's body.  
  
---  
  
"...Senpai. Why did you protect someone like me? I'm already impure. Even if I like you, I can't do anything for you.  
  
So why are you protecting me, going as far as making Tohsaka-Senpai―――Nee-san your enemy?"  
  
---  
  
Sakura's voice echoes in my head like a clanging bell.  
  
...The reason I'm protecting Sakura.  
  
I don't even need to think about it.  
  
I don't even need to think about it, so I can tell her even in my current state.  
  
---  
  
"―――You're wrong. I didn't protect you. I just wanted to be with you.  
  
I need you, Sakura, and I couldn't think about being separated from you.  
  
So I can't give you to Tohsaka, even if she is your older sister."  
  
---  
  
"Are you saying that as family?  
  
Or do you see me as a woman?"  
  
"――――――――"  
  
There's no way that I can see her as family now.  
  
I've wanted Sakura by my side these past couple of days―――no, for a long time. ...It's just that I can't lie to myself any longer.  
  
---  
  
"――――Yeah. I love you, Sakura."  
  
I'm still entranced, but I manage to say it.  
  
...I know it's something I shouldn't say, something I shouldn't give in to, but I can't fight against it any longer.  
  
---  
  
"Then please make love to me.  
  
Or else―――I'll feel so uneasy that I'll go crazy."  
  
---  
  
"――――But Sakura..."  
  
My voice of reason mounts one last, desperate defense.  
  
But...  
  
"...Senpai. Am I dirty...?"  
  
Her words destroy every obligation in me.  
  
---  
  
"―――――――, Sa..."  
  
My tongue is not working.  
  
Proper thoughts freeze in my brain.  
  
―――Sakura's bare legs.  
  
I try my best to look away from the spectacle that grabs a hold of my heart.  
  
---  
  
"Sa... kura――――"  
  
Is my mind not the only thing frozen?  
  
My eyes keep staring at Sakura, and my body, even the fingertips, doesn't move.  
  
---  
  
"......Senpai."  
  
Embarrassed, Sakura trembles a bit.  
  
The motion causes a silver droplet to stream down her legs.  
  
---  
  
"――――"  
  
The smell makes me dizzy.  
  
I shouldn't be able to smell it, but seeing the light reflected off of it makes me feel her warmth.  
  
---  
  
"...Please look, Senpai. Please don't look away and watch my lewd body."  
  
"――――――――!"  
  
I can't oppose her voice.  
  
...I know I'm disgracing Sakura the more I stare at her, but I can't avert my eyes.  
  
---  
  
The juices stream down.  
  
Her bare vagina is more than wet enough.  
  
The lewd juice flows out and streams down her legs.  
  
Although she closes her thighs bashfully, she cannot contain the flow which is down to her ankles now.  
  
---  
  
―――The moonlight entangles with the trickling juice.  
  
Sakura's love juice does not let go of the light it catches.  
  
The light sparkles in between her legs.  
  
---  
  
―――So...  
  
"...It's strange, right? I-It's natural for you to want to look away. ...I've been like this ever since we held hands.  
  
...It does this just by being near you, and no matter how much I pleasure myself, it won't settle down. I can't take my mind off you, Senpai, and I..."  
  
―――How could I ever call her dirty?  
  
---  
  
"Why? You're not dirty. You're beautiful, Sakura."  
  
"――――Senpai."  
  
Her voice flushes a bit.  
  
She looked like she was about to collapse, but now she seems a bit more steady.  
  
---  
  
"...I'm not lying. You're so beautiful that I had to lie to myself so that I wouldn't notice.  
  
...So don't condemn yourself like that. It's not your fault that your body's like that."  
  
---  
  
My heart thumps.  
  
I talk as I try to suppress the blood from going to my crotch.  
  
It's the last-ditch resistance brought on by my reasoning.  
  
To that...  
  
---  
  
"Then please make love to me. ...I want you right now, Senpai."  
  
...Sakura destroys it with a heated voice.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
It's as if she whispered it by my ear.  
  
Sakura's voice seeps down to my bones and destroys my small reasoning.  
  
―――No, there's no way to fight it from the start.  
  
No man can stay calm when faced with the naked body of the woman he loves the most.  
  
---  
  
"――――Sakura."  
  
"...You don't have to move. ...I'll make you feel good."  
  
---  
  
Sakura tempts me with words like burning steel.  
  
―――I understand it in my head.  
  
I know I want Sakura.  
  
My penis is so erect that I can't hide it anymore.  
  
Sakura is wanting me, and Sakura's body is needing magical energy―――my semen.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
Then there's no reason to oppose her.  
  
I can satisfy both if I accept Sakura.  
  
...But...  
  
Wouldn't that keep the most important reason unclear?  
  
---  
  
"...Senpai."  
  
Sakura's voice is coming from near me.  
  
Sakura's body is right in front of me now.  
  
...I can't move.  
  
Is it because of tension or confusion?  
  
Every part of my body is bound, and I can't stop Sakura.  
  
---  
  
Her skirt falls to the ground.  
  
...I hears the sounds of clothes being taken off.  
  
Sakura takes off her clothes to get naked, and I'm taking off my shirt even though I can't move by myself―――  
  
---  
  
"...Please, Senpai... I can't bear it any longer――――"  
  
Sakura sounds like she's apologizing.  
  
"――――Sa... kura."  
  
The zipper on my pants is lowered as soon as I hear her voice.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
My reasoning cracks.  
  
My head blanks out when I see her young and vivacious body.  
  
---  
  
"Ah...... Hm....... I'm going to touch it, Senpai..."  
  
Sakura's fingers touch my erect penis.  
  
She handles it like a valuable object.  
  
She entangles her white fingers around my hot and hard penis.  
  
---  
  
"Ah, s――――――――"  
  
There's no way I can stop her.  
  
Sakura's fingers are touching my thing.  
  
That feels good enough to make me moan.  
  
No matter how much my useless mind tells me to stop, my body is already tempted by Sakura.  
  
---  
  
"...I'm sorry, Senpai... I know you don't like this, but――――"  
  
Sakura turns around and slowly lowers her waist.  
  
Hot juice drips down onto my crotch.  
  
---  
  
"Haa... Hmm... Yours is so hard..."  
  
...The love juice flowing out of her wets my manhood like honey.  
  
---  
  
"Mm... We have to make sure it's wet..."  
  
Sakura grabs my shaft as if to soak her honey onto my shaft.  
  
---  
  
"――――Hold, on――――"  
  
Her fingers stimulate my body, and I feel something sticky between us.  
  
I'm about to fall from just this, but Sakura is...  
  
"Haa... Hm, mm... Ah, I can, right, Senpai?"  
  
She sighs painfully as if she cannot wait any longer.  
  
And she pushes the head of my penis onto her crevice.  
  
---  
  
"Ahh... ah, mm, fu..."  
  
"――――......!"  
  
―――A slight shock runs through my back.  
  
My erect head enters Sakura with a sound.  
  
Her wet vagina accepts the hard foreign body without resistance.  
  
---  
  
A wet sound.  
  
The tip, which should be too big to enter Sakura's small hole, easily pushes in between her walls and plunges deeper in.  
  
---  
  
"Hah, ah―――...!?"  
  
―――I don't understand.  
  
Just putting the tip in feels so good that I'm going to go crazy...!  
  
---  
  
"Hold... on, Sakura――――......!"  
  
I quickly pull my hips back.  
  
But my body is still numb.  
  
Sakura doesn't listen to me.  
  
---  
  
"Mm... ha, it's big... but――――ah, haa... It's coming... in――――"  
  
She breathes with her shoulders and slowly lowers herself.  
  
---  
  
"――――Ah......!"  
  
The sound.  
  
I can't bear the sound of me tearing Sakura apart.  
  
---  
  
"Ah, mm...! Ah, fua, ah―――hm... Sen... pai―――Senpai's touching... me..."  
  
―――Sakura's crevice.  
  
The red part has accepted the tip of it already.  
  
The walls roll up as my penis is pushed in, and at the same time, they try to accept the penetrating object and guide it deeper inside.  
  
---  
  
"...Haa... Haa, haa, ah..."  
  
――――It's tight, but not, at the same time.  
  
Sakura's slit and my penis melt and join into each other.  
  
And from behind her too.  
  
We're in such a position, but Sakura's the only one moving.  
  
---  
  
"Ha――――――――"  
  
It feels so good that I want to vomit.  
  
A woman's back is before my very eyes.  
  
Her big butt is squashed in front of me.  
  
―――I'm piercing Sakura from behind.  
  
It makes me imagine that I'm inserting it in her butt instead of her pussy, and it's all the more unbearable.  
  
---  
  
"Ah――――, ah."  
  
"Ha, aha... It's getting bigger, Senpai... Does it feel good...? Mm... aha, ah――――! ...Ah... It feels good for me too――――"  
  
---  
  
I'm scared.  
  
I bear the welling cum because I'm scared.  
  
I grit my teeth and endure the oncoming surges of pleasure.  
  
---  
  
"Ah... Ah, no... Senpai...? Mm, ahh... um, is it painful...?"  
  
Painful――――?  
  
No way. It can't be painful when it feels this good.  
  
I'm just scared because I can't suppress myself.  
  
---  
  
My desire is up to my throat now.  
  
If I can move, I want to push Sakura down and pierce through her.  
  
I'm scared of myself for wanting to fuck Sakura like mad.  
  
---  
  
"...D-Don't Sakura...! If I continue, I'll――――"  
  
I'm scared that I might lose my sanity.  
  
---  
  
"Ah... Haa, hmm, mm...! ...No, I'm sorry, Senpai―――ah, I can't... stop myself――――"  
  
---  
  
"Hey――――I'm saying... don't...!"  
  
――――There's no way she'd listen to me.  
  
My cock is deep inside Sakura.  
  
So―――how could she stop now?  
  
---  
  
"Haa... Mm, the big thing's coming in――――"  
  
Sakura moves as she moans in an intoxicated voice.  
  
The surge that led me inside is now trying to keep me inside.  
  
---  
  
"...!"  
  
Her walls are pulsing.  
  
Her thick walls grasp at my penis and softly wrap themselves around it.  
  
---  
  
"Ah, aha, hm... Can I, Senpai...? It's in, so I'll move now―――"  
  
Her warm pussy has me caught.  
  
Sakura slowly starts to move up and down.  
  
---  
  
"Ah, aha, ahh...!"  
  
"......!"  
  
I grit my teeth and bear it.  
  
I will release my cum along with my mind unless I do so.  
  
---  
  
"Ahh, fua, ah, haa...!  
  
...Aha... Good―――it's so big."  
  
I'm caressed with numerous fingers and tongues.  
  
Sakura awkwardly moves up and down while squeezing her walls.  
  
"Hah, hmm, mm, mm......!"  
  
---  
  
A sound of liquid.  
  
Her love juice leaks out.  
  
She's moving as if to taste my penis with her vagina.  
  
It's a diligent service that tells me how she feels.  
  
She's not good, but she's trying her best to please me, and that fact itself is a pleasure.  
  
---  
  
"Ah, it's touching me inside... It's coming in slowly... Haa... mm, ah...! I'm glad... I'm so happy――――I'm sorry, Senpai."  
  
Her voice sounds like she's crying and intoxicated at the same time.  
  
Sakura is apologizing, but shaking with pleasure at the same time.  
  
---  
  
"Hm... mm, fu, mm...! You can see it, right, Senpai...? I'm connected with Senpai... Mm... I'm happy... I always wanted to do this with you, Senpai...!"  
  
---  
  
...Sakura heats up and starts to move faster.  
  
Her movements were kind, but now they're getting more intense.  
  
She's happy.  
  
Her movements reflect her emotion by sucking, squeezing, and entangling herself on me.  
  
---  
  
"...Sa... kura――――"  
  
"Ah, haa――――I-I'm going to do my best...! So, you too, Senpai...!"  
  
---  
  
...My reason is melting.  
  
Her walls expand and contract, matching her movements.  
  
They contract when I'm going out, but they suck me in when my tip is reinserted, drawing up my urge to ejaculate.  
  
"Haa... ah――――!"  
  
It feels so good that I can't keep my mouth closed, and my saliva drips down my chin.  
  
---  
  
"Mm... Is it too strong, Senpai...? Aha, then... I'll slow down... a bit――――"  
  
Her juice covers my cock while her butt moves vertically.  
  
"――――!"  
  
It's like a simple up and down movement, but it's actually a pot of meat that wriggles around from time to time to stimulates my manhood.  
  
---  
  
"Ah――――"  
  
...This is hard.  
  
I never thought it'd be this hard to keep my reasoning and suppress my urge to ejaculate.  
  
It feels good inside Sakura.  
  
But it feels like torture as well――――  
  
---  
  
"Hm... Ah, aha, mm...! ...Huh? ...I'm going slow... but I can't... stop my hips――――hm, ha, haa, nhaa, ahh...!"  
  
Sakura's movement does not stop.  
  
A shock goes through my abdomen every time her firm butt presses on it.  
  
---  
  
"Haa――――, guh――――...!"  
  
...Her wet meat.  
  
Her delicate walls vibrate to invite me into the deepest part of her.  
  
---  
  
"Guh――――ah."  
  
"Hm, nha, why――――!? Why am I―――ah, faa, hm, ah...! ...Ah... I'm sorry, Senpai―――I'm sorry, Senpai...!"  
  
---  
  
Sakura apologizes, but her pussy squeezes my erect shaft even harder.  
  
...I could ejaculate any second now.  
  
Our genitals are wet with her juice and my pre-cum.  
  
Sakura's pussy still has some room even after accepting me.  
  
It expands, contracts, wraps itself around me, and squeezes me.  
  
The varying movements are like those of an educated prostitute.  
  
---  
  
"...Haa... Haa... Hm, ahh... Amazing... Yours is amazing, Senpai―――"  
  
"――――――Sakura. Please... stop."  
  
"...Ah... Ah, no...! ...Mm, no, I can't, Senpai――――ahh, mm, I can't stop myself――――!"  
  
---  
  
...The swirl greedily demands more.  
  
...My reasoning is crumbling apart.  
  
Her soft walls are like an aphrodisiac.  
  
My penis is wet with aphrodisiac, and the pleasure is melting my brain.  
  
---  
  
"Ah――――Ah――――"  
  
The overdosage of aphrodisiac causes my form to be vague.  
  
I can only open my mouth and suppress my voice.  
  
...I'm swallowed by pleasure.  
  
I'm like a bug that fell into a pot of aphrodisiac.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――Guh."  
  
My desire washes away my reason.  
  
...This isn't just a pot of aphrodisiac.  
  
This is a never-ending sea of pleasure.  
  
The body accepting me right now is of the finest quality that any man would be addicted to.  
  
That body is telling me to go crazy.  
  
I'm telling Sakura to stop for her sake, but she isn't listening to me.  
  
Then―――there's no need to―――restrain myself.  
  
---  
  
"Hm, Senpai... Senpai, please use your hips too... Mm, nha......!"  
  
---  
  
―――There's only a fragment of reasoning left in me.  
  
Sakura doesn't know how I can't retreat and keeps moving her hips to pleasure me.  
  
---  
  
And...  
  
The obscene body that wriggles like a snake...  
  
---  
  
"Haa――――ah, ah――――!"  
  
...Crushes my hindering reasoning.  
  
---  
  
"Ah――――hau, Senpai...!?"  
  
I raise my hips.  
  
I grab her butt and sink my nails into her hot body.  
  
---  
  
"――――! ...! Ahh... haa...!! Faa, mm, aha...! Hm―――ha, it's amazing, Senpai, you're so rough...!"  
  
I plunge into her without any consideration.  
  
I'm ignoring Sakura's condition, but she just shakes her butt in delight.  
  
---  
  
"Ah―――mm, haa, ii...! I'm glad... More, Senpai...!"  
  
She raises her indecent ass.  
  
Sakura holds out her body without me ordering her.  
  
---  
  
"Fuu, nha, ah...! It's big, and thrusting me from behind, ah, hmm......!"  
  
Sakura moans.  
  
She arcs her back and takes the thrusting meat on all fours.  
  
---  
  
"...! Senpai, Senpai...! Senpai is so, ah, nha, mm...!!!"  
  
I pierce her without hesitation to make up for all the time I couldn't move.  
  
Over and over.  
  
I violently pull back, push in, pull back, and move my penis as if to oppose the welling urge to ejaculate.  
  
---  
  
"Ya, mm, ah... Hia, ahhhhh...!!!! Senpai―――ah, hah, amm, ah, fua...!"  
  
It might be painful, as Sakura's voice starts to contain some agony.  
  
---  
  
―――But I don't stop.  
  
Our sex turns ferocious.  
  
Sakura tries to accept it and raises her butt.  
  
"――――, Haa――――"  
  
My vision, the only thing not invaded by the pleasure of Sakura, breaks with that.  
  
---  
  
Her butt is lewdly raised, exposing her excretory organ.  
  
―――It squeezes tight.  
  
It's straining as if to bear the pain, and it's closed as if to follow her pussy's example.  
  
It is wet with my pre-cum and her love juice.  
  
---  
  
"Ah――――kuh."  
  
The dirtiest place on Sakura is dirtied with our juice.  
  
It's so lewd that I want to start laughing, and it makes me all the more crazy.  
  
---  
  
"Ah―――it's embarrassing, Senpai's, aha, ahh, watching my butt...!"  
  
Our juice splatters around every time I push into her, and the juice sticks onto her butt.  
  
---  
  
"Ah――――, kuh――――"  
  
The scene fires up my desire.  
  
Sakura's asshole. I see the place where even Sakura cannot see, and a sense of domination assails me.  
  
---  
  
"Mm, Senpai...! It's good, it's deeper, ahh, nha, it's good, so good, ahhhh...!"  
  
---  
  
―――I keep thrusting.  
  
My thrusts get stronger.  
  
My penis is fully expanded, stirring up Sakura's vagina.  
  
She accepts it painfully.  
  
"It's painful―――ah, move more, Senpai―――please go harder and squash my butt...!"  
  
---  
  
And Sakura's walls change as if to match my sexual desire.  
  
---  
  
"Ha, you――――!"  
  
The waves of pleasure that I thought were at their limit grow bigger.  
  
My brain is filled with Sakura's sensation and is about to explode.  
  
---  
  
"Haa――――aha, haa, ahaa, mm......!"  
  
―――She desires me without end.  
  
But that's not only her wish, as it is also mine.  
  
---  
  
"Ah... Mm... no... I'll overflow, hmm, if you do that――――"  
  
I raise my butt and thrust up.  
  
"Mmm, ah――――! Ahh, nha, haa... Ah, fuaaaaa...! Senpai, I'm going to come...!"  
  
I don't pull back and rub my tip inside of her.  
  
---  
  
――――Dry sounds constantly echo through the room.  
  
The room is stained with the sound of our moving hips, the sound of the juice splashing, and Sakura's moans.  
  
---  
  
"Haa, ah――――I like you――――I like you, I love you, Senpai...! I've loved you for so long, nha, I can't keep it in anymore...!"  
  
---  
  
"Ah, kuh――――!"  
  
I keep moving, while Sakura accepts it and shakes.  
  
The pleasure changes every second, not letting me rest.  
  
Her walls change shape every time she arcs her back and stimulates me from different angles.  
  
――――I feel faint.  
  
My mind is constantly being stimulated and is about to escape my body.  
  
---  
  
"Fua, haa, ah, ahh, ahh...!!! More, Senpai, together, Senpai...!!!!"  
  
"――――――――!"  
  
I can't end easily.  
  
If Sakura wants it, I have to answer her.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――Ahh."  
  
And I want to savor Sakura without end.  
  
I don't need my reasoning.  
  
I don't care even if my mind escapes my body.  
  
I can kick away such nuisances that keep me from being human――――!  
  
---  
  
―――Our membranes rub against each other.  
  
My grotesque member is wet with foaming love juice.  
  
Her contracting walls suck on my blood-congested penis.  
  
---  
  
"――――, ――――"  
  
It'll end anytime.  
  
I'll ejaculate with the next thrust if I let down my guard.  
  
I frantically grit my teeth, wanting this pleasure to last longer.  
  
---  
  
"Ah, haa... Hm... Does it feel good, Senpai?"  
  
"――――, Ah――――"  
  
I can't say anything.  
  
I'll be unable to endure it if I say something.  
  
---  
  
"――――If it's good――――please say my name―――haa... I want you... Senpai, to say my name...!"  
  
Her pussy contracts with her voice and squeezes me.  
  
---  
  
"Sa――――kura."  
  
I pierce her.  
  
She doesn't need to tell me.  
  
My head is filled with Sakura and Sakura only.  
  
---  
  
"Sakura――――"  
  
"Yes...! Senpai, Senpai...!"  
  
Her back is covered with sweat.  
  
My member is covered with both our juices.  
  
Sakura's crotch is covered with something viscid and is reflecting light like something about to emerge from a pupa.  
  
---  
  
―――I'm melting.  
  
My senses are so vague that I'm starting to think I'm melting.  
  
---  
  
"Aha―――Senpai called my name... You properly said my name when I'm so indecent――――nha, Senpai... Senpai, Senpai, Senpai...!!"  
  
Sakura responds every time.  
  
I feel a definite sensation every time she squeezes on me.  
  
---  
  
"Sakura――――Sakura...!"  
  
My desire gets worse.  
  
Her lewd and meaty butt, her smooth back, her messed hair, her sweet moaning.  
  
Everything is like a dream, and my consciousness is about to...  
  
---  
  
"No――――I, I, I'm――――!"  
  
――――It must be the same for Sakura.  
  
The body that desired me raises itself, as if drawing on its last power.  
  
---  
  
"Ahh, ahh――――! ...No, I don't want this myself...! I――――I want to feel good with you, Senpai...!"  
  
---  
  
Her pussy squeezes me with all its might.  
  
"――――Guh......!"  
  
I thrust it in as if to fight against it.  
  
I feel pain as my impulse breaks the dam.  
  
---  
  
"Sakura――――, Sakura......!"  
  
"Nha, ahh――――no, don't let me go, Senpai...!!!"  
  
I release the strained power.  
  
My restrained desire is let loose as if guided by Sakura's orgasm.  
  
---  
  
"Ahh―――mm――――mm, Senpai... is ejaculating... a lot...――――"  
  
"――――!"  
  
My cum ejaculates as if to shoot down her womb.  
  
---  
  
"――――Wait――――hey――――"  
  
―――Something's wrong.  
  
I've let enough out, but it doesn't stop.  
  
---  
  
"...Ahh... Mm... Aha, ahh..."  
  
Sakura takes in my hot impurity.  
  
Sakura sounds satisfied and drains her strength.  
  
---  
  
"Ah――――kuh."  
  
A long ejaculation I've never experienced before.  
  
My cum fills up Sakura and flows out.  
  
I've let out enough, but it doesn't stop ejaculating.  
  
---  
  
"Ah... aha, amazing, it's still coming in. Senpai... Senpai's hot juice... it's coming in me and flowing out――――"  
  
Sakura sounds like she's in a trance.  
  
...My consciousness fades.  
  
I can't hear Sakura's voice.  
  
---  
  
―――A never-ending ejaculation.  
  
It's more than what my testicles can generate, and it's a pleasure as if I'm ejaculating my organs out.  
  
---  
  
――――I see a dream after that.  
  
---  
  
We're both tired and sleep together after having sex.  
  
Sakura hesitated with a blush, but she nodded when I asked her if she wanted to, and came into my futon with a red face.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I'm dreaming.  
  
I'm sleeping and was so tired that I won't wake up till tomorrow, so this has to be a dream.  
  
That's why...  
  
I'm still having sex with Sakura.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I'm desiring Sakura even in my dreams.  
  
That's how exciting the sex with her was.  
  
If it's possible, I want to embrace her and sleep together like this.  
  
...I want to tell her that I love her.  
  
She was filled with pleasure every time she said Senpai, and I want to respond to her affection.  
  
---  
  
"――――――――"  
  
I'm having sex with Sakura.  
  
I'm having sex with her even in my dream.  
  
―――I'm still having sex with her even though we've already made love like mad.  
  
---  
  
I had sex, but it wasn't enough, so I'd rather fuck her really violently so that I can really destroy her――――  
  
"――――――――Oh."  
  
What am I thinking?  
  
That's going too far.  
  
---  
  
"Ah――――"  
  
My vision wavers.  
  
Sakura's not there.  
  
I was holding on to Sakura, but I'm now holding something strange.  
  
---  
  
"Ha――――, ah......"  
  
It's hot.  
  
My foothold is melting.  
  
I'm sinking into an eternal desire.  
  
I'm literally drowning in a sea of pleasure called Sakura.  
  
---  
  
...I see a violent dream.  
  
I see an ominous dream in a sea of hot coal tar.  
  
---  
  
  
  
  
  
## Scene 39 Connection of bodies [Realta Nua]  
  
I finish taking the bath and return to my room.    
Now that I’ve changed out of my wet clothes, I finally feel like I’m home again.  
  
“---Phew.”    
I sit down and let out a sigh while relaxing my shoulders.    
…Today was a long day.    
Many things happened, and there were many ups and downs.    
I sort out the things I’ve lost from those I still have.  
  
“…Right. Sakura is Rider’s Master.”    
It seems Sakura had given her right to Shinji, but she is Rider’s Master now.    
Then Rider must be nearby, protecting Sakura.  
  
“…Yeah. I’ve seen Rider a few times already.  
  
If she’ll be protecting Sakura, I have to go introduce myself to her properly.”    
    
    
…She’s unapproachable because of her appearance, but I think she’s understanding.    
I don’t know when Sakura will be discarded by Zouken, so Rider is the only one I can rely on.    
    
    
…Well, according to Kotomine, Sakura’s condition will get worse the more she uses her Servant, so relying on Rider is a last resort.  
  
“All right. I’ll have Sakura introduce me to her tomorrow.  
  
Oh… but she might hold a grudge after losing to Saber.”    
My shoulders slump.    
…But Rider will be living here too, so I should at least greet her  
  
“---Who is it!?”  
  
“……!”    
I raise myself so that I can dodge instantly and glare at the shouji.    
…Outside the room.    
…I can see the silhouette of someone standing on the porch.  
  
“---”    
…There’s no reply.    
The figure seems to be waiting for my reaction.  
  
“---”    
…Damn.    
There’s nothing I can use as a weapon here. I guess I’ll have to attack first before  
  
“---S-Senpai. Um, are you awake…?”  
  
“Huh…? Oh, it’s you, Sakura.”    
I sit back down.  
  
“You can use the bath whenever you like. If you need a change, there’s Fuji-nee’s clothes, right?”  
  
“…Yes. I’ve already taken a bath and borrowed Fujimura-sensei’s clothes.”    
    
    
“…?”    
…? Then I don’t think there’s anything else to ask.  
  
“Um… Senpai. Can I come in?”  
  
“Yeah. What’s wrong, why are you being so formal?”  
  
The shouji opens.    
And the person entering the room is…  
  
“---”    
Sakura, in normal clothes, acting strangely.  
  
I hear someone gulp.    
I realize that it’s me and feel myself heating up.  
  
“---”    
I cover my mouth with my hand and look away.  
  
“---”    
This makes no sense.    
I looked away, but the urge to look at her is overwhelming.    
My heart’s beating rapidly, and my head is so confused that it might run away unless I keep the reins on. I don’t know why, but Sakura is stirring up strange feelings in me right now.  
  
“……”    
Sakura just stands there.    
I finally realize that something else is strange.  
  
“…Sakura, what’s wrong? How’s your fever? Do you have a cold after all…?”  
  
“…No. I do have a fever, but it’s not because of a cold.  
  
It’s not because I’m sick that I’m burning up.”    
Sakura looks down awkwardly.  
  
Sakura acted like this from time to time over the last couple of days.    
…I thought I’d grown used to noticing parts of her that I didn’t know about, and that she’s a girl my age.    
But… I think this is on a different level entirely.  
  
“…Sakura?”  
  
“…It’s no good, Senpai. I can’t suppress it by myself any longer.”  
  
“WWhat can’t you suppress?”  
  
“…Inside… me… even when I was going home with you, just thinking about how warm your hand was…”    
“---”    
    
    
Sakura sways unsteadily.    
…It looks like something more serious than just a fever.  
  
“I… Senpai, why… Ah…”    
…I can’t think clearly.    
It’s clear that something is wrong with Sakura.    
In that case I should take her hand and lead her back to her room, but I can’t move.    
    
    
It’s maddeningly silent.    
Sakura draws towards me as though blown by wind.    
Her foot catches on the edge of the tatami mat, and  
  
“---Ah.”    
Was that my cry, or Sakura’s murmur?    
Sakura collapses feebly.    
My feet move again.    
I move to help Sakura to her feet  
  
Too late, I awkwardly catch Sakura.    
There is clearly something wrong with her body.    
She’s burning up, but only her limbs are cold. Her body is feverish, but her arms and legs are bloodless.    
…This is absolutely not an ordinary fever.    
This isn’t caused by sickness, but a poison made by human hands.  
  
My gaze moves.    
Sakura is burying her face into my chest.    
…There’s a long silence.    
She doesn’t make a sound, but Sakura is crying.  
  
“…Sakura.”  
  
“…Senpai. Why did you protect someone like me? I’m already infested. Even if I like you, I can’t do anything for you.  
  
So why are you protecting me, going as far as making Tohsaka-senpai---Nee-san your enemy?”    
    
    
…The reason I protect Sakura.    
I don’t even need to think about such a thing.  
  
“---You’re wrong. I just wanted to be with you.  
  
I need you, Sakura, and I couldn’t think about being separated from you.  
  
So I can’t give you to Tohsaka, even if she is your older sister.”  
  
“Are you saying that as family?  
  
…Or do you see me as a girl?”  
  
“---”    
There’s no way that I can see her as family now.    
I’ve wanted Sakura by my side these past couple of daysno, for a long time.    
…It’s just that I can’t lie to myself any longer.  
  
“---Yeah. I love you, Sakura.”    
    
I say it clearly.    
…It’s ridiculous. When faced with the possibility of losing Sakura, my insignificant facade is finally stripped away.  
  
“…Senpai.”    
    
Sakura is trembling.    
No, maybe it’s me who’s trembling.    
Of course I’m nervous lying down with Sakura in my arms and confessing my feelings to her like this.    
I put just a little strength into my hands that are holding her.  
  
…It’s quiet.    
I thought I’d be more agitated, but after putting it into words, I feel completely calm.  
  
“Sakura.”    
Sakura’s shoulders are moving.    
Her head shakes as she faces into my chest.    
I told Sakura that I love her. So I want to ask if she feels the same.    
…No, maybe I don’t need to ask.    
From tomorrow on, we could spend the mornings together like usual.  
  
“…Sen…pai.”  
  
Her frailty takes my breath away.    
Her voice sounds even weaker than before.    
It’s not the voice of someone feverish.  
  
“Ah… hey, Sakura… ah…”    
Sakura’s body bends.    
Sakura is on top of me, and something seems to be wrong with her.    
Not only is she feverish, there’s something pitiful about her, as if she’s enduring something.  
  
“Sakura, hey… hold on, are you okay?!”    
Sakura’s body is heating up, and at the same time, her limbs are getting colder.    
---I need to calm down.    
I can’t help Sakura, but Tohsaka---no, that’s no good, then I’ll take her back to the churchno, instead of taking Sakura there, I should call Kotomine here.  
  
“Hold still. I’ll help you feel better right away.”  
  
“Senpai… I… ah… haa, haa, haa…”    
Then first I should put her to bed.    
Sakura is clinging tightly to me.    
…Her anguished expression makes me bite my lip.    
I told Sakura that I love her, but I can’t even do anything for her.  
  
“I want it… Senpai, I… don’t have… enough…”    
    
Her incoherent mutter mixes pain and bashfulness.  
  
“I can’t… hold back… I… can’t bear it…”    
    
Our breathing quickens.    
Sakura’s pained breath, and mine as I listen to it.    
…I can’t stay calm being close to her.    
For now, she needs to sleep in a warm bed.  
  
“Okay, Sakura, just”  
  
“---!”  
  
Sakura refuses and tries to run away… no, she leans back and grabs my hand.  
  
“Ah… sorry, Sakura.”  
  
“That’s not it, that’s not it, Senpai… I… no, I can’t…”    
    
I thought Sakura didn’t want to be touched, but that’s not it.    
Sakura is behaving inconsistently.    
Her arm is gripping my hand and trembling as it tries to draw me toward her, but her upper body is trying to move away.  
  
“Sakura? Hey, Sakura!”  
  
“I can’t, if I do that… Senpai will… hate me… Ah… But, it hurts… and Senpai’s hand is… so warm”    
    
    
My hand in Sakura’s moves slowly towards her.    
…I can’t pull free.    
I can’t let go of this frail, resisting hand.  
  
“Ah… Senpai… no, I don’t… have enough…”    
There’s a captivating quality to Sakura’s voice.    
Sakura brings my hand close, and  
  
As if looking for relief, she bites my finger.  
  
“Huh---”    
The surprise steals my strength away.    
Why is Sakura doing this?  
  
“…Ow.”    
She bites into me.    
There’s a slight pain in my fingertip.    
Sakura’s teeth tear my skin, and pain and blood begin to pour out from the inside.  
  
My blood streams out.    
Sakura’s shaking gradually slows.    
Her cold limbs start to gradually regain their warmth.  
  
“Mm…”    
    
She gulps.    
There is a tiny movement in her throat as she swallows the blood.  
  
“…”    
The tip of her tongue touches the wound.    
It makes a quiet sound as she drinks the red blood.  
  
“…Urk…”    
    
My finger feels so pleasant it’s as if it’s about to melt away.    
I feel the sensation of Sakura’s lips, and the occasional gentle touch of her tongue.    
But more than that, with every drop of blood that leaks from the wound, a sweetly pleasant feeling washes over me.    
    
    
    
…I’m sure I’ve felt this same pain somewhere before.    
But I can’t remember what kind of experience it was.    
It feels so good it seems like a bother to remember.    
She’s only sucking my finger, but the comfortable sensation runs past my wrist and up to my elbow.  
  
“Mm… mmm…”    
    
It’s as if the veins from my heart to my fingertip have been brought into sharp relief.    
The blood carrying my magical energy spills into Sakura’s mouth, and…  
  
“Ah… aah…”  
  
…I look objectively at the reality of the situation.    
Sakura is drinking my blood while holding back embarrassment. And her condition is improving.  
  
Then---what’s the problem in what she’s doing?  
  
“…Ha…ah…”    
    
How much blood have I lost?    
Judging by the weakness from my loss of blood…  
  
…I’m sure I’ve only lost as much blood as I would from a blood donation.    
Sakura gives my finger a final lick, and with a sound, lets it fall away from her lips.  
  
We look at each other wordlessly.    
Sakura’s condition seems to have returned to normal, but she still looks forlorn.  
  
“…Sakura?”    
Finally, I call her name.    
I hold back the strange pleasure I felt from my finger, and my unease about what just happened.  
  
“Senpai… Ah, ah…”    
With a start, Sakura lets go of my hand and jumps back.    
She flees to the corner of the futon in a rush, and kneels while looking down in embarrassment.  
  
“Sakura… no, I don’t mind if you can’t answer.”  
  
“…I’m sorry.”    
    
Her voice is so quiet it’s like it’s about to disappear.    
When I turn to face her, Sakura hangs her head as though cowering, her hands in her lap.  
  
“…You know, right, Senpai?”  
  
“I was trained as a magus at the Matou household.  
  
…Grandfather tampered with my body so that he could turn a child of another bloodline into a magus of the Matou family. …The result is this body that goes crazy when I don’t have enough magical energy.”    
    
…A dark rage towards Matou Zouken wells up within me.    
But even more than that, Sakura’s passionate, pitiful speech fills my chest with pain.  
  
“The worms in my body want power from a magus, so they start to ache. When that happens, I can’t hold back anymore.  
  
The worms eat up all my magical energy, and then they say that it’s not enough and they want more. …So I… Senpai’s…”  
  
“So the reason you drank my blood…”    
“…”  
  
She gives a small nod.    
In this silence, it makes a very definitive answer.  
  
“There’s a lot of magical energy in a magus’s blood. So I started wanting to drink your blood, Senpai. If I drank that, it would replenish my magical energy, and it would relieve the weird things happening to my body.”    
    
    
…I see.    
Going back to being Rider’s Master greatly increased Sakura’s consumption of magical energy.    
…She was able to live normally without difficulty up until now, but now even that takes up magical energy.  
  
“There’s something wrong with me, isn’t there. I-it makes sense that you’d turn away from me, Senpai.  
  
I’ve been aching ever since we came home together, and I couldn’t think of anything but you, and even though you’re trying to help me I took it from you by force”    
“---”  
  
“…Senpai. I’m strange, aren’t I.”    
    
Her voice breaks.    
The wound Sakura gave me throbs with pain right to my heart.  
  
“Even when you were holding me and worrying about me, I wanted to drink your blood.  
  
You said you loved me as a girl, but sucking your blood was all I could think about.  
  
All I could hear was the worms moaning. I wanted to feel better, I just wanted to feel better soon, so I wanted Senpai, Senpai’s bloodI thought maybe I didn’t really love you, I just wanted to love you so I’d be able to drink your blood, so…!”  
  
“---”  
  
“…I’m sorry. Someone like me who can only think of sucking blood to make herself feel better isn’t worthy of your love”    
    
---It’s obvious.    
I don’t even know why I should have to say it.  
  
“There’s nothing wrong with you. You’re beautiful, Sakura.”  
  
“Ah…”    
    
I embrace her again and whisper.    
Sakura’s shoulders stiffen as if to resist me, but she goes limp in my arms.    
Is it because Sakura is shaking and cryingor because I’m saddened that I can’t cry for her?  
  
“…Don’t be stupid. How could I hate you over a little blood?  
  
I loved you, Sakura. You’re so beautiful I had to pretend not to notice until now.  
  
…So don’t blame yourself like this. It’s not your fault your body is the way it is.”    
    
    
I stroke her shoulder.  
  
Sakura leans on my shoulder and sobs quietly.  
  
“And you know what? When you were sucking my blood, I was happy.”  
  
“…Huh? But, Senpai…”  
  
“There’s nothing strange about that. Even if I can’t cure you, I was happy that I could make you feel better.  
  
So don’t worry about it. If you refuse the only thing I can do for you, where does that leave me?”    
I pat Sakura on the back as if to cheer her up.  
  
“If my blood will help, then tell me anytime.  
  
If it will make you feel better, I’d be happier that way.”    
…I’m glad that I fell in love with Sakura.    
Because even if it’s just a little, it’s something I can be proud of.  
  
“…I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Senpai, I…”    
    
Sakura is apologizing.    
Each time, I stroke her shoulder and tell her there’s nothing to be sorry for.    
Sakura is shaking uncontrollably, like a small child.  
  
“I love you, Senpai. I love you, so I thought I wasn’t good enough.  
  
But, if you’ll still love me, then… I have a request.”  
  
“…Okay.”  
  
“If I suffer again, will you… help me?  
  
Even if I drink your blood, you won’t hate me?”  
  
I stroke her head as I tell her it’s all right.    
Sakura stops trembling, and smiles through her tears.  
  
“……I’m glad, Senpai.” “…I’m glad that I fell in love with you, Senpai.”    
    
    
…She gives my cheek a light, but deeply affectionate kiss.    
Touching the spot where her lips gently touched me, I go red just remembering it.    
We touched many times up until now, but now it feels embarrassing all of a sudden.  
  
“…Well, uh.”  
  
“…Senpai…”    
    
We let go of each other and kneel face-to-face.    
Everything that’s happened up to this point is flooding into my head all at once, and I can’t move.    
Sakura seems the same, and our gazes roam restlessly around  
  
“…Thank you for helping me so much today.  
  
I’m going back to my room… Good night.”    
    
Sakura stands up in a hurry.    
I have no reason to stop her, and I’m too embarrassed to anyway.  
  
“Good night, Sakura.”  
  
“…Yes. Good night, Senpai.”  
  
The shouji slides shut, and Sakura disappears.    
…Now that I’m alone, I touch my cheek and my finger.    
The seriousness of Sakura’s situation is inevitable, but when I remember what just happened, I feel really happy.  
  
“---Time to sleep.”    
    
…I want to remember it some more, but there’s a lot to do tomorrow, and I have to think about what to do about Tohsaka, and there’s Rider, too.    
…Plus the Grail War isn’t over yet, and I need to take down Matou Zouken who’s the source of all this trouble, so Sakura  
  
…See, I really am getting sleepy.    
My mind and body are both tired, so I need to sleep soundly now and give it my all from tomorrow onwards  
  
I’m dreaming.    
I should be sleeping alone, but there’s someone cuddling up to me.    
I’m too mentally and physically exhausted to be awake, and Sakura went back to her room.    
So I could only be sleeping beside Sakura in a dream.  
  
“---”    
    
Even in my dreams, Sakura is drinking from me.    
That’s how stimulating it was when Sakura drank my blood.    
    
    
    
…I want to tell her that I love her.    
She repeated “Senpai” over and over, desiring me, and I want to respond to her affection.    
“---”    
Sakura is drinking from me.    
Even in my dreams, Sakura is drinking from me.    
    
…I’m literally entranced.    
    
    
    
It’s not enough. It would feel better if it were enough to break both of us.    
If creation is a gentle pleasure, then destruction is an intense one.    
You see, they are both an undeniable catharsis.    
    
    
    
“---”    
    
What am I thinking?    
That’s, completely, inhuma  
  
“Ah”    
    
My vision wavers.    
Sakura’s not there.    
Sakura was drinking from me, but all of a sudden I’m being eaten by something strange,  
  
“Ha---, guh……”  
  
It’s hot.    
My foothold is melting.    
I’m sinking into a scalding-hot mire.    
I’m drowning, knowing that this is Sakura’s body heat  
  
…I have a violent dream.    
I have an ominous dream in a sea of hot coal tar.
