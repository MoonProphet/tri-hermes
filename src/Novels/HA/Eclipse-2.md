# Second Eclipse  
  
### Life of Sakura  
  
---  
  
《Why don't you come over to my house when you have time?  
  
　...Um, there's something I want to show you, Senpai.》  
  
　Sakura had asked me some time ago.  
  
　Being so busy lately, I haven't had the chance to visit the Matou's in a while. So I decided to make use of the free time and drop by in the morning―――  
  
---  
  
　Tree canopies are painted white.  
  
　The blossoming floral pattern has been dyed a dazzling light pink.  
  
---  
  
“―――”  
  
　...It's quite a surprise.  
  
　It's been about five years since I set foot in the Matou residence.  
  
　Until now, the trees in the yard had never bloomed. Now, they are bursting with blossom as if having been reborn.  
  
---  
  
“Ah, Senpai! Welcome, please come in!”  
  
　Sakura runs towards me, waving her hand.  
  
　Because of the brilliance of the flowers, Sakura's smile seems to glisten even more than usual.  
  
---  
  
“Sakura, is this what you wanted to show me? The cherry blossom trees?”  
  
“That's right, just as you can see.  
  
　The season may have passed, but these young beauties have been asleep for many years, after all. Late bloomers still need their time.  
  
　Ah, but this one here is a bit weird. It's already much older than me.”  
  
---  
  
“? Is it really that old?”  
  
“Yes. It's been here long before I was born.  
  
　Since it was my grandmother who planted it here, it's really an old lady, isn't it?”  
  
---  
  
　...I see.  
  
　It's no wonder she'd want to show them to me, seeing how long they took to finally bloom.  
  
---  
  
“That is not the only amazing thing that happened.  
  
　Actually, this is the very first time that this tree has bloomed.”  
  
“Eh? You said it was planted during your grandmother's time, so that's more than fifty years in the past, right? And there wasn't a single blossom until now?”  
  
---  
  
“...That's right. People thought it would never happen, either, so no one took care of it.  
  
　But as you can see, it's in full bloom now. It must have really wanted to.”  
  
“――――――”  
  
---  
  
　Moved by Sakura's emotion, I look up at the tree.  
  
　This is the first time the old woman's flower has bloomed―――It is unbelievable.  
  
　Sakura's smile is so heartwarming, so proud.  
  
　For some time, the two of us just watch the flowers.  
  
　Sakura's coat swells in the gentle spring breeze.  
  
---  
  
“Oh, what good is it standing here and talking anyway?  
  
　Senpai, if you have time, would you like to come inside?  
  
　We can see the cherry blossoms through the window even better than here.  
  
　I will make some tea, then we can enjoy the view together.”  
  
　She squeezes my hand tightly.  
  
　I grip her palm in return.  
  
---  
  
“Ah...”  
  
“So is it alright if I stay for a bit?”  
  
“Okay!”  
  
---  
  
“I'll go prepare the tea, so please excuse me for a moment.”  
  
“Thanks.”  
  
　Sakura's room seems to have changed quite a bit.  
  
　With the flowers visible from the window, it is heartwarming and cozy.  
  
　However, today's highlight is the other side of the window rather than the room itself.  
  
---  
  
“It sure is a luxury, viewing cherry blossoms without leaving the room.”  
  
　I relax for a moment while watching the beautiful flowers.  
  
　How should I put it? I feel like this atmosphere is the very essence of spring.  
  
　The cherry trees through the window, Sakura's figure quietly watching the scenery, these all bring out that smell of the sun like no other.  
  
---  
  
“Yeah, it sure makes me feel at ease.  
  
　You said it was your grandmother who planted it, Sakura?”  
  
“I have never had the chance to meet her, though.  
  
　It seems the cherry tree she planted just did not take well to this soil. It did keep growing, but they say it never had a single flower.”  
  
“Oh. And this year―――”  
  
---  
  
“There are people called "arborists."  
  
　They are doctors who heal trees by examining the ones that seem to be withering, and healing the bad parts so they can grow again.”  
  
“Aah... now that you mention it, I did hear of an occupation like that.  
  
　So you had one of those experts come over?”  
  
---  
  
“Well... I thought perhaps I could do that sort of thing by myself.”  
  
　Sakura smiles in embarrassment, as if she had just been caught committing mischief.  
  
　...So that means...  
  
　The one who healed that tree was Sakura herself?  
  
---  
  
“Huh... Ah, but it must have been pretty difficult, right?”  
  
“Yes, but I did my best!  
  
　I did lots of research, and kept working at it.  
  
　I softened the soil, I placed my ear to the trunk of the tree and listened to the sound of the water inside it, I helped the branches find their way to the sun as they grew longer.  
  
　I still don't fully understand how it feels, but bit by bit it grew healthy, and finally gave all the flowers you see now.”  
  
---  
  
“That's really amazing... I get it.  
  
　Sakura, something like that really suits you. Little by little, even if no one knows about it, your caring touch is the best thing about you.”  
  
　Really, so much that I wish a certain show-off would take a lesson from you.  
  
---  
  
“I'm still a novice, though.  
  
　Ah. It may have been easier for me to understand because we share the same name.”  
  
　Sakura smiles and takes a deep breath.  
  
　It seems as if she's feeling the warmth of the wind from deep inside her body.  
  
---  
  
“――――――”  
  
　We stop talking for a while and just gaze outside.  
  
　It's probably thanks to the reborn tree, and the quietly smiling Sakura.  
  
　This room's atmosphere is too calm, and it makes me want to feel the body heat of the one I care for.  
  
---  
  
“I see. So that tree must have really wanted to bloom.”  
  
　I mutter, recalling the words that I heard under the flowers.  
  
　"Yes," Sakura's expression softens.  
  
---  
  
“That's right.  
  
　All of them―――everyone wants to have their chance to bloom.”  
  
　Her gesture of prayer shows no weakness of being reliant on anyone.  
  
　To Sakura, these words are just a desire that had long been accepted.  
  
---  
  
“―――Yeah. I kind of understand what you're talking about.”  
  
　I reach out with my arm.  
  
　This is not lust, but pure feelings of love,  
  
“I, too, want to see Sakura blossom.”  
  
“Eh, Senpai―――?”  
  
　I embrace Sakura's body smoothly.  
  
---  
  
“Ah...”  
  
　As I feel Sakura's body on mine, a sudden impulse arises in me.  
  
“Sakura... is here alright?”  
  
“...Yes. I'm glad, Senpai...”  
  
　Our lips touch.  
  
　In a corner of an eye, I can see flower petals flutter by.  
  
　In but a brief moment, spring morning came to this room.  
  
---  
  
“Ah... um, Senpai... this is embarrassing.”  
  
　She speaks with a faint, whispering voice from on top of the bed.  
  
　Absent-minded, I almost forgot myself because of the warmth of her skin.  
  
---  
“Embarrassing? Why?”  
  
“Do... do you think that I am getting fat?”  
  
　Sakura bashfully twists her back.  
  
　Even though the fullness of her body may overflow from underneath the arms she covers herself with, I don't think so at all.  
  
---  
  
“Really...? Nope, same as always. Don't worry about it.”  
  
“...This is my first time in daylight... Ah...”  
  
　I embrace her bare bosom.  
  
　The top of the bed shakes.  
  
---  
  
“Ah... Yah...”  
  
　I kiss Sakura's heavy breasts.  
  
　Her breasts are like prized fruit that took years to grow, the pointed tip of which now touches my tongue.  
  
　...It isn't that sweet, and I'm a little disappointed.  
  
---  
  
“I'm telling you, you're not gaining fat at all.  
  
　Yes, your breasts are big, but the rest of you is just fine, Sakura.”  
  
“Ah... Senpai, you're still touching my breasts while you're talking―――ah, nn...”  
  
---  
  
　The plump fullness of her breasts dances in my hands. My fingers feel like they are about to be completely engulfed as I continue to squeeze them.  
  
　Slowly, I rub her breasts, which look like they're going to burst any moment now.  
  
---  
  
“Kya, nn... Ha, ahaa...”  
  
　No matter how much I touch them, Sakura's breasts remain soft, like marshmallows or butter.  
  
　A soft and flexible flesh is seen swaying underneath the bright sunlight, contrasting with the pink nipples.  
  
---  
  
“Ah, ngh... Haa... Aaah... Senpai...”  
  
“I'll keep going, alright?”  
  
“Haa―――hnn!”  
  
---  
  
　I firmly caress and massage Sakura's breasts.  
  
　Her face is on the verge of tears, but her body is honest. As I feel her stiff nipple with my thumb...  
  
---  
  
“Ah―――hnn...”  
  
　A faint breath escapes as she bites her lip.  
  
　These breasts that have always seemed so tight beneath their clothes are now dancing in front of me.  
  
　Just looking at it makes my groin become hot, yet I rub them even more.  
  
---  
  
“Haa, aah, nn... ngh, ah―――”  
  
　She starts to get used to this calm rhythm.  
  
　A softly creaking bed. A gentle breeze passing through the wide-open window. Both bring the scent of cherry blossom with them.  
  
---  
  
“Senpa...i... Haah, ahn, hn...!”  
  
　I'm squeezing tightly with my fingers, licking between my lips and sucking.  
  
　Her skin looks fresh and radiant under the sun. I indulge myself in it.  
  
　With my free hand, I stroke her stomach.  
  
---  
  
“Aah, no, kya―――!?”  
  
　Trembling, her skin wavers under my palm.  
  
　It feels just as nice and gentle as her breasts.  
  
---  
  
“...See, it's so jelly-like, and I'm...”  
  
“I told you, you're not fat at all... It's perfectly natural for girls to be tender, isn't it?”  
  
---  
  
“Aah, ha...ah... I guess... so...”  
  
　I keep stroking and let my hand wander to her side.  
  
　Here, with so little muscle, it feels particularly good.  
  
　Really, it all feels so good that I'm a little embarrassed.  
  
---  
  
“Over there, it tickles... Haah, ngh!”  
  
　Sakura's body is shaking and swaying.  
  
　She's reacting way better than I expected. My head is starting to get burning hot.  
  
---  
  
“Ha, haa―――ngh...!”  
  
　Away from the sides, I move on to her butt, then to her thighs.  
  
　It's like touching a peach with its soft, downy hairs.  
  
　That too has become ripe and soft, its fragrance alone sweet enough to make me dizzy.  
  
---  
  
“Senpai, like that... Haa―――”  
  
　For the first time, I notice how sensitive Sakura's body really is.  
  
　Is it because we're doing it in bright daylight, or is it just the season?  
  
---  
  
“―――Nnn...”  
  
　I touch a hidden part of Sakura's body.  
  
　Much like dripping fruit nectar, the juice clings to my fingers.  
  
　Warm and wet, my fingers sink in.  
  
　As I push apart the folds, the feeling of touch evolves into stimulation that threatens to stick in my throat.  
  
---  
  
“...Sakura...”  
  
“Senpai... It's alright. Really, you...”  
  
　Sakura's hand reaches out and feels for my waist.  
  
　Her fingers coil around the flesh rod that keeps getting harder with every loving caress.  
  
　My back shivers in anticipation of pleasure.  
  
---  
  
“Please come in... I already...”  
  
“Gotcha, just relax―――”  
  
　I position myself above Sakura once again, shifting to get my hips firmly against hers.  
  
---  
  
　Suddenly―――Sakura stretches out her hand.  
  
　Like two branches that grow together, our fingers intertwine.  
  
---  
  
“――――――...I'm glad...”  
  
　Sakura's voice sounds relieved between her slow breaths.  
  
---  
  
“Sakura?”  
  
“We have become connected, Senpai and I. Like roots and soil, tree branch and sky, flower and season are all connected to each other, the two of us―――see, a grip this tight―――”  
  
　Our warm palms are clinging to each other.  
  
　As if to answer her, I squeeze her hand, gently yet firmly.  
  
---  
  
“Yes... We are together, the two of us.  
  
　I love you, Senpai.  
  
　Now and forever after―――”  
  
　...It's different from a definite desire earlier.  
  
　Telling herself that it's something impossible, something she shouldn't wish for. I just love that weakness way too much,  
  
“Sakura―――”  
  
---  
  
“Ah, nngh...―――”  
  
　To feel her warmth even more, I pull Sakura closer.  
  
---  
  
“Haa, mmm, hn―――!”  
  
　Our hips are stuck firmly together.  
  
　My penis settles into Sakura's vagina.  
  
---  
  
　I start to move slowly.  
  
　Not to be left behind, Sakura is gently rocking her body as I embrace her.  
  
　A light rhythm that I've experienced before.  
  
　―――Through the window, I can see the trembling branches.  
  
　Just like that, a quiet song resembling the whisper of the wind.  
  
---  
  
“Ah... Ahn, mn, haa... nngh...!”  
  
　Calm breaths escape, growing familiar to my ears.  
  
　I wanted to feel the other side of Sakura, even more. I purposefully break our rhythm and stir around inside of her.  
  
　A warm and pleasant feeling starts building in my heart.  
  
---  
  
“... Ah... Senpa...i―――ngh, ah―――”  
  
　Her body is trembling, and her chest is bouncing almost comically.  
  
　Her firm standing nipples are swaying. It's a gorgeous sight.  
  
　Sakura quickly adjusts to the perturbed rhythm.  
  
　I feel like there are still unexplored depths in this young woman's body.  
  
---  
  
“Ah... nn, haa, aahn, haa...”  
  
　Our two bodies keep moving towards one another.  
  
　Our hands that held onto each other without letting up are stopped mid-air. Our bodies, on the contrary, are now pivoting around this point, heaving as they go.  
  
　With every sharp gasp, Sakura's pussy tightens.  
  
---  
  
“Aha, haa... ngh, haa... ahn...!”  
  
　I almost forget to breathe.  
  
　...This is the first time we have sex like this.  
  
　Bodies melt together in the light, hair swaying smoothly and voices getting ever hotter.  
  
　Like a pendulum, our waists keep pushing together.  
  
---  
  
“Nn... haa, ahn... ngh...”  
  
　With my free left hand, I caress Sakura's ass.  
  
　Her lively rear is soft and elastic. As I touch it, her body becomes tense and jerks at the change in movement.  
  
---  
  
“Nn... Fua, hah...  
  
　Ah―――Sen...pai...i...”  
  
　Her voice and breathing spread from her throat to my ears.  
  
　My movements speed up on their own, too.  
  
　Wanting to make Sakura feel even better, like before, I slam my hips―――  
  
---  
  
“Haa, yah, nn―――!”  
  
　However, her body does not let go.  
  
　Instead, Sakura's depths hold firmly onto me.  
  
　She hugs me mischievously―――and I feel like melting in the pleasant sensation.  
  
---  
  
“Emiya, Senpai... fua, ah―――”  
  
　Sakura's legs wrap around my waist.  
  
　Our hips meet as if to hug each other.  
  
　No matter how deep I go, I am met with the same loving embrace.  
  
---  
  
　With a bump, I felt myself reach the end to her depths.  
  
　Yet my hips keep twitching with the desire to go even further.  
  
---  
  
“Ah... it's, good... Hah, ah―――nn...!”  
  
　It feels so good to make pulling out a serious problem.  
  
　Both Sakura and I are wet with love juices as we intertwine. Trembling, we keep repeating our search of pleasure and warmth.  
  
---  
  
　I hold Sakura's body as if dancing with her.  
  
　With a wet, bubbling sound coming from our genitals, we forge ahead with deep, intricate moves.  
  
　Our entwined hands covered with sweat, we renew our grasp many times.  
  
　Just because it seemed as if we would end up melting.  
  
---  
  
“Senpai... ngh... sen...pai.”  
  
　Sakura's gasps came as a whisper in bits and pieces.  
  
　I strain my arousal-muffled ears.  
  
---  
  
“Sakura―――”  
  
　I grasp her fingers with force, firmly bringing them together.  
  
　Immersing her body in mine, I embrace Sakura tightly.  
  
　Our hipbones are rubbing together, hard, as if smashing her body against the meat of her butt.  
  
---  
  
“Ahnngh, ngh, ngh, Senpai... nfuaa!”  
  
　Bearing it all, Sakura tightens up.  
  
　Though her body may be tender, her vagina alone is more than supple enough.  
  
　I'm moving violently as if trying to crush her.  
  
---  
  
“Ha, ku―――Senpai... Naagh, ngh...!”  
  
　Our joined hips move slightly apart.  
  
　Not only am I pressing against her, but now Sakura is moving with me, too.  
  
　We continued to knead together, sensitive parts resounding ever more forcefully.  
  
---  
  
“Aahn, it's good, Senpai, haa, aah, hn, ahaah!”  
  
“Sakura...! Sakura―――”  
  
　Moving in an unchanging rhythm, I focus only on brute force.  
  
---  
  
　Twisting or shaking, anything remotely complicated is all but blown away.  
  
　It feels so good and fulfilling right now, I couldn't care less.  
  
---  
  
“Ahn, haa, ahn, aahn, Senpai... good...”  
  
　Sakura responds as well.  
  
---  
  
　Whether it is Sakura taking root in the soil inside me, or whether it is me, as a single grain, falling and budding in the vast land of Sakura, I just don't know anymore.  
  
　All I know is that my chest is burning hot in our embrace.  
  
　Pressing against each other feels warm and pleasant.  
  
---  
  
“Ha, haa, aahn... Haa, ya, aaaahn!”  
  
　I go about rubbing Sakura's pussy single-mindedly.  
  
---  
  
　It isn't so much a penis and vagina as it is a connection like the intertwining roots of a nervous system.  
  
　I can feel that Sakura is feeling it.  
  
　Our fingers are intertwined, quivering and holding tightly.  
  
---  
  
　A heartfelt entanglement, never to be broken no matter how much you try.  
  
　A fire flares up from deep inside. I want to connect with Sakura even deeper.  
  
　―――From before our bodies were lying like so, overlapping each other.  
  
　To fill the blank space from before I met Sakura.  
  
---  
  
　A white dazzling light.  
  
　Love and lust melt together. Not just pleasure, it is a climax of pure happiness that threatens to melt my backbone.  
  
---  
  
“――――――! Hnn...!”  
  
　My body comes back.  
  
　Sakura's body leans back in an arch, my arms embracing her deeply.  
  
　All that I had, contracted to a single point, is now bursting out to ejaculate inside Sakura.  
  
---  
  
“Haa... Aaaahn... nn...”  
  
　It feel bliss as I pour into her.  
  
　To compensate for what was lost, a warm power comes flowing in from Sakura.  
  
　Embracing, our sweat covered bodies overlap.  
  
　An ease I never knew until now spreads out gradually, enveloping me completely, together with enormous exhaustion.  
  
---  
  
“Ha, ah―――”  
  
　Both of our bodies are drained.  
  
　Our skin is still hot and pulsing, the sounds of our rough breathing overlap.  
  
---  
  
“Ah ―――Senpai, please look.”  
  
　Sakura speaks softly in my ear.  
  
　Still holding on to her hand, I nod in response.  
  
　Our clasped hands that look as if they had gotten stuck, tell us of one another's heartbeat.  
  
---  
  
“Pretty... isn't it?”  
  
　Outside, white petals are swimming through the breeze.  
  
　They flutter as they are washed away, flying across the window. Some also land onto Sakura's skin.  
  
---  
  
“Senpai... we had all sorts of fun, didn't we?”  
  
　Still locked in an embrace, she speaks.  
  
---  
  
“Like going to the pool, watching the autumn leaves at Ryuudou-senpai's temple, or meeting under the Shinto station's Christmas tree.”  
  
“Yeah, we went out a lot, didn't we. And there was that time when Rider came in at midnight with no warning.”  
  
“That caught me way off guard, and I went hiding in a closet as fast as I could. Even Rider was troubled, bending her brow like so.”  
  
---  
  
　I want to keep on talking like this forever.  
  
　But strength is slowly draining from our fingers.  
  
---  
  
“That's... not the end of it. We'll keep having fun, right? Nothing is lost forever, is it?”  
  
“...Of course. The fun things aren't going anywhere.  
  
　Let's say―――for instance, should either of us die, everything up until now certainly happened. There's no way any of it will disappear.”  
  
---  
  
　...And just like that, our entwined fingers come undone.  
  
　Partings can be found anywhere and everywhere.  
  
　But at the same time, I want to believe that another meeting can come around anytime.  
  
---  
  
“Sorry for making you wait!”  
  
　Having stepped outside first, I wait for Sakura.  
  
　Dyed scarlet red by the setting sun, the sakura trees look even more elegant.  
  
---  
  
“Are you okay? If you're tired, it's perfectly fine to just take a nap, you know?”  
  
“I'm not tired at all! And anyway, you too, Senpai, I'd actually like for you to at least stay in my room for tonight.”  
  
“Then I could see the evening blossoms...”  
  
　Hmm.  
  
　Thinking that, I can't help but feel a tinge of regret. Oh well, save it for later.  
  
---  
  
“.....................”  
  
“What is it?”  
  
“Hehe, evening sakura?―――Well, that's fine too.”  
  
　She smiles suggestively.  
  
　Since the flower viewing ended up like "that" today... A shiver runs down my spine as my imagination goes to work.  
  
---  
  
“Ah! I've got to clean out the fridge today or tomorrow before anything spoils. You'll give me a hand too, right, Sakura?”  
  
“Yes, of course.”  
  
　Happiness within reach ought to come first.  
  
　Diligent and faithful, our boring everyday world keeps turning.  
  
---  
  
“When I graduate, too―――”  
  
　Walking by my side, Sakura strikes up a conversation.  
  
　We walk home, arms entwined.  
  
---  
  
“Actually, I think I want to study and get a job like an arborist, you know?”  
  
“Sakura as an arborist... you're definitely cut out for the job.  
  
　Seeing how you managed to make the trees back there bloom like that.”  
  
---  
  
　That one tree might have been just a stroke of good luck, but I have a feeling that in Sakura's hands things will definitely go well.  
  
　Talking about a happy future, we return to our usual everyday.  
  
　Well then.  
  
　Whichever road Sakura and I end up choosing a year later, that's for another story―――  
  
---
