# Babylonia Episode 0  
  
**Romani:**   
This is your story, and the story of another.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
The story of a journey.  
  
  
**Chaldea Engineer 1:**   
It's a success! We did it!  
  
  
**Chaldea Engineer 2:**   
D-Director!  
  
  
**Chaldea Engineer 2:**   
Director, it's not safe here! Please evacuate!  
  
  
**Chaldea Engineer 3:**   
Our second defensive barrier has been breached!  
  
  
**Chaldea Engineer 4:**   
What is the director doing in there?!  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I've got to hurry.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Yes. I did have to hurry.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I didn't have even a second to spare.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
That's a nice fragrance.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Darjeeling, as usual?  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
As long as it's drinkable, it could be water for all I care.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
I'm glad to see you in good health, Archaman.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
Though I hear you won't be continuing as a magus.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I'm doing the best I can with the knowledge and skills I have now.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
An excess of modesty is itself closer to bragging.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
But I did feel that might be the case.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
So, where are you now?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Well, I never did find a place that felt right.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Actually, I have a favor to ask you.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
If you're willing, I'd like you to take me on here.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
What do you say?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
All right.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
It all starts here, Romani Archaman.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Existences recorded within the collective knowledge of humankind, known as Heroic Spirits, can be given physical form using mana and commanded as "Servants."  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Furthermore, a Heroic Spirit unable to materialize by itself could be made to possess the body of a human being, thereby becoming what was called a "Pseudo-Servant"— but our experiment's goal was something else altogether.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
A fusion of Heroic Spirit and human— a living weapon with a conscious will.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
The Demi-Servant Project.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
That's what you've been working on for over a decade.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
That's right.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
I've raised a number of test subjects for that purpose.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
Of all the subjects, she was the most ideal.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
But the Heroic Spirit that fused with her refused to cooperate with us and went silent, leaving her without a Servant's powers— only the immense physical strain.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
Not quite.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
We did succeed in activating the Relic.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
Using it as a catalyst will allow us to perform more stable experiments with the Heroic Spirit System.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
Servants are an invaluable factor in the preservation of human history.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
A successful Rayshift is only half the battle— we also need to prepare a stockpile of weapons.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
But now work can begin on a more stable summoning system, all thanks to her noble sacrifice.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
But she's a Designer Baby.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Her rate of cellular decay was already high, and the experiment may have accelerated it even further.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
On the other hand, her fusion with a Heroic Spirit will allow her physical body to remain at its peak.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
She won't age, even as her cells degrade.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
She's lucky, don't you think?  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
She doesn't need to fight.  
  
All she has to do is continue to live.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
She'll accompany Team A as a catalyst for summoning.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
I don't expect anything more from her, and I'd rather you didn't either.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Let me be her personal physician.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Is that all right with you?  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
That depends. Are you asking out of pity?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
No. I ask purely that you allow me to maintain her health as a doctor.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Her condition is very precarious.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I don't think anyone else can ensure that she'll live two more years.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
Very well.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Oh, no. I was only appointed to Chaldea five years ago, so if anything, you'd be my senpai.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Nice to meet you. My name is Romani Archaman.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I'll be your doctor from now on.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
You can call me Roman.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Hm...  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Dr. Roman.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Has a nice ring to it, right?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Roman.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
A word that means "an optimistic observation of the future as holding countless possibilities."  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Is that right?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Wow, you know a lot for a ten-year-old.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
You really are my senpai.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
The senpai-kouhai relationship is one of teaching and learning, but I haven't taught you anything, Doctor.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
All of my knowledge was input by Sheba, so Sheba would be the senpai in this case.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Well, if you look at it that way, then I suppose so.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes. That fits my definition of what a senpai is.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I see.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I'd interpret it a little differently.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
The way I see it, if there's anyone who would truly be your senpai, it would be someone who's an ordinary human.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Someone who's an ordinary human?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
A person who can live among other people and share the joy, sorrow, and anger that they feel.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Someone like that.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
So a senpai when it comes to socialization and living life?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I suppose so.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
And also someone who can focus on the long term, I guess?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Focus on the long term?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Yes.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Someone who cares about their home and neighbors, whose heart is full of compassion for others.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Someone who sees people in need and acts to help them, no matter the reason.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
In my opinion, this is the greatest virtue humans possess.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
In other words, someone who is not egotistic but altruistic.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Would that not be a weakness?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
To an animal, it would be a disadvantage.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I suppose that's true. Human beings are capable of thinking before they act, and they have to be able to make difficult decisions.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
But that also makes them the only organisms to knowingly do things they know won't benefit them.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I find that fascinating.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I see. I will add these to the list of qualifications for my future senpai.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Are you not my senpai?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Nope. I'm still far too inexperienced to qualify.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Now, as your doctor, there's something I'd better talk to you about.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
It's about your lifespan.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
You were a Designer Baby.  
  
That means your cells decay very fast.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Even if we're very careful about maintaining your health, your lifespan will be eighteen years at most.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
First of all, do you understand that?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
All lifeforms can only operate for a limited duration.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I have no misconceptions concerning the length of my own operational period.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I see.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
This is going to be even more difficult than I thought.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Are you referring to maintaining my health?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Ah, yes. There's that, of course.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
But that's up to me.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
As long as I'm around,  
  
I'll keep you alive and healthy.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
The problem is...  
  
  
**Romani:**   
No, never mind that.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
In any case, let's do our best together, Mash.  
  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
This is utter folly.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Now, now. Settle down,  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Successfully Summoned Heroic Spirit Number 3.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Or rather, Leonardo Da Vinci.  
  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm perfectly settled. But I'm also getting awfully fed up with all this.  
  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Safeguarding all human history?  
  
With the paltry equipment they've given us?  
  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Not to mention those Demi-Servant experiments, which are not only inefficient but also inhumane.  
  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
There's not the slightest bit of beauty in it.  
  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
If I'd only been summoned sooner,  
  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I'd never have allowed those mediocre fools to make such a mess of everything.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
You have every reason to be upset.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
This is all wrong.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I want to be truthful with her and acknowledge that what we're doing isn't right.  
  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
And you're a fool of an entirely different sort.  
  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey, Romani, don't you think this is too cruel?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Do you know of any magic that can reveal the sky,  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Professor Lev?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
That's an unexpected question.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Well, all right.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
It does exist, but it's rather pointless.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Does that answer your question?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Rather than try to make the skies above Chaldea blue, it would be far more economical to take a trip to Antarctica.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
You'd have much clearer skies out there, too.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I see.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I guess you're right.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
But why do you ask?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Does the good doctor feel a touch homesick?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Not at all.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
It's just...  
  
  
**Lev:**   
So it's about Mash?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Yes.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
I see. Very interesting.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
I was invited to join Chaldea for my ability as a magus, in order to construct the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
In that capacity, I also served as Mash's teacher.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Though it was only in regard to magecraft,  
  
I've known her even longer than you now.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
She was raised to be as pure and reticent as possible, in body and spirit, so that she could one day become the vessel for any Heroic Spirit necessary.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Mash is indeed very mentally stable.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
The theory of her upbringing was sound.  
  
No doubt ever enters her mind.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
But the physical wounds she bears are extremely painful.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Every test she's subjected to hurts her.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
And that pain can become fear, ultimately turning to hate.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
No heart can endure torture forever and stay pure.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
And yet, she...  
  
  
**Lev:**   
As of now, she has remained pure.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
That girl never compares herself to other people, Romani.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Thus she never feels envy or hatred toward others.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
To her, every human is her senpai in terms of their lived experiences.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
She looks up to everyone and accepts them for what they are.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
No matter how much pain or injustice she endures,  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Mash sees only the good in people.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
She said there's nothing she loves more than seeing people smile— that it's all it takes to make her happy.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Come to think of it, I suppose that's true of us too.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
It's a natural reaction, isn't it, Romani?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
But aren't you curious?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
After all, no one can tell what kind of person she'll grow up to be.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
"Pure" is a pretty word indeed, but "naïve" is an equally accurate one.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Once she's exposed to the ugliness of humankind and the corruption that permeates its history, will she still believe that people are good?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
That's the one thing that still worries me.  
  
  
**Solomon:**   
What do you wish for?  
  
  
**Solomon:**   
The Holy Grail War is over.  
  
  
**Solomon:**   
We've won.  
  
  
**Solomon:**   
...What will you wish for?  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
The completion of Chaldeas.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
I care nothing for the Third Magic.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
For an astromancer of the Animusphere line such as I, it would be unthinkable not to reach the Root via my own unique approach.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
What about you, then?  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
What do you desire?  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
Oh, it's you.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
You're five minutes late.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
That's not like you—  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
You want me to put a stop to Chaldeas, eh?  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
That's an awfully difficult request.  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
The preservation of humanity, or my own life— which is more important to me?  
  
  
**Marisbury:**   
What a silly question.  
  
  
Olga:  
What's happening to the flame of Chaldeas?!  
  
  
**Romani:**   
All too soon, the day arrived.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Human history would cease to exist beyond 2016.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
The phenomenon couldn't be explained.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Chaldeas frantically combed 2,000 years of information about the past to find the reason for the future's disappearance.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
What they discovered was Time-Space Singularity F.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
In the year 2004, at the site of a certain city in Japan, an unknown quantity that had never existed in history prior to 2015 was discovered: an area that was impervious to observation.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Chaldea determined that this was the cause of humanity's future extinction, and submitted their experimental Rayshift proposal to the UN, which approved it.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
The Rayshift process converts humans into spiritrons, which are then sent into the past to intervene in events there.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
In other words, it's a form of retrograde time travel.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
And Mash was chosen to be part of Team A, which would carry out the First Mission.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
The Director really doesn't like me, huh.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
She says my nonchalance is contagious.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Well, there's nothing I can do about that.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
It might not look like it, but I'm charging ahead at top speed.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Excuse me.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
It's occupied—  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Huh? Who the heck are you?!  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Back then, I never questioned anything.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Not the pain I had to endure, nor the limited lifespan I possessed, nor my own existence.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
None of the other doctors ever came into my room before.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Oh, is that right?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Chaldea's quite an advanced place if people here can convey their feelings even through glass.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I'm still so inexperienced.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I don't know how to talk to people unless we're face-to-face.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
So tell me anything you want about what you think or how you feel. Don't hold back.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
It makes a huge difference in the volume of information we'll be able to get, and besides, it's a lot more pleasant this way.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Successfully Summoned Heroic Spirit Number 2...  
  
  
**Romani:**   
No, from now on, I'll call you by name.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Hello. It's nice to meet you, Mash Kyrielight.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
H-Hello. It's nice to meet you too, Dr. Romani.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
If this reaction could be called "human," then it was the first true "human" reaction I showed to anything.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Good morning, Mash! How are you feeling?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
From then on, the doctor spent a great amount of time talking with me.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Every experience was new to me.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Everything I thought and felt, things I liked, things I considered important, things that were warm and pleasant.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Sometimes the Doctor told me funny stories about the facility, and sometimes I listened to him complain, but little by little, I started to develop an interest in the world outside my room.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Good morning, Mash!  
  
I've got some good news for you today.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Your vital signs have been excellent lately.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Your brainwaves are also very stable.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
If this keeps up, you won't have to stay in the clean room anymore, and you'll finally be a full-fledged member of the Chaldea research staff.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Thank you.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Oh, I know! When that happens,  
  
I'll do something to celebrate!  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Is there something you want?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
A book, for example, or a toy, or a snack?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Isn't there anything?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
If it's within my power, I'll make it happen.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I think I'd like to go outside.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I'd like to go outside and see a clear sky.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
That was the only thing I wanted.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Unfortunately, Chaldea is located on a snowy mountain 6,000 meters above sea level.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
The only thing visible outside is a blizzard.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
But those rare nights when the sky is clear,  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I hear you might get a glimpse of a beautiful starry sky.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I believe the day will come when you can see that sky for yourself.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Fou-san.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
That was what I'd called the mysterious creature that had grown attached to me as of late.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Have you ever seen the stars, Fou-san?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Looks like the sky won't be clear today either.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Fou-san?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Wait!  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Please wait for me!  
  
  
*--Song starts playing--*  
  
*Whenever I’m alone, I start to hear it speak / hitori ni naru to kikoeru no*  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*“If it hurts so much, why not give up?”, it says to me / kurushii nara yamete ii to*  
  
  
**Mash:**   
The sky was the first thing I'd ever wished for.  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*It draws me in as crushingly as a black hole black hole / mitai ni fukaku*  
  
**Goetia:**   
Our King pitied humankind and declared that he would save them from the inevitability of death.  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*The terrifying yet bewitchingly sweet voice that speaks those words / kowakute miryokuteki na amai koe ga*  
  
  
**Goetia:**   
I cannot comprehend it.  
  
  
**Goetia:**   
Can you, Mash?  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*It tries to mimic your voice and the way you speak to me / anata no kuchiguse wo manete*  
  
  
**Goetia:**   
Does humanity truly hold such value?  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*So I pretend that nothing is wrong / nandemo nai to itte miru*  
  
  
**Narration (Kinda sounds like Merlin)):**  
What you love, what you hate,  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*But even if that wasn’t true, I wouldn’t care at all / sore ga uso demo kamawanai*

what you hold dear, and what you consider evil...  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*If it gave me the strength to get back on my feet again / tachitsuzukeru douki ni nareba*

It's all up to you to decide.  
  
  
**Narration:**   
By coming to know many things and seeing many places,  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*Every lifespan draws to an end eventually / subete no inochi ni owari ga aru no ni you begin to endow your life with meaning.*  
  
  
**Narration:**   
Listen well.  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*So why do humans fear and lament it the way they do? / doushite hito wa obie nageku no darou*  
  
  
**Narration:**   
The world is not what you make of it.  
  
  
**Narration:**   
You are what the world makes of you.  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*Knowing that eventually everything will be lost / itsuka wa ushinai to shitteru kara*

**Drake:**   
That's what it is to be human.  
  
  
**Drake:**   
And that's what we are!  
  
  
**Drake:**   
That's why everyone has hope in their heart!  
  
*--Song--*

Why do you fight?

*Because I’m alive right here in this world with you / anata ga iru sekai ni watashi mo ikiteru*  
  
  
**Solomon-Goetia:**   
Your life is destined to end.  
  
  
**Solomon-Goetia:**   
With such a finite span of time allowed to you, why do you yet cling to life,  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*Red, blue, indigo / aka ao ai*  
  
**Solomon-Goetia:**   
even knowing there is no hope in your kind's future?

Miss Mash.  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*Their colors / iro*  
  
  
**Nightingale:**   
Dreams and wishes are radically different things.  
  
  
**Nightingale:**   
Fixing your glare on reality, figuring it out, and fighting on until the end is the way to open the path to what you wish for.  
  
  
**Nightingale:**   
From now on, live your life for your own sake.  
  
  
*--Song--*

**Sanzang:**   
There's no logic behind my actions.  
  
  
**Sanzang:**   
I just do what I want to do.  
  
  
**Sanzang:**   
No—I do what I believe I have to do, and I do it with my head held high.  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*I don’t care what anyone else may say / tannin ni nani iwaretemo ii*  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*I know exactly what it is that I hold most dear / taisetsu na mono ga nanika wa wakatteru*

I know you are.

The sky was the first thing I'd ever wished for.  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*I wish for nothing more than this / kore ijou nozomu koto wa nannimo nai*  
  
  
**Mash:**   
But that was no more than a dream formed waiting at a window in a snowstorm.  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*The future I desire is the one that exists right here / watashi ga hoshii mirai wa koko ni aru*

Now everything is different.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I've seen so many places, met all sorts of people,  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*The person who first taught me what loneliness is / hajimete sabishisa wo kureta hito and came to know both the world's vastness and its warmth.*  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*Who gave a meaning to my solitary existence / tada no kodoku ni kachi wo ataete kureta no*  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh, that's right.  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*There is only one future that I’m looking for / watashi ga miteru mirai wa hitotsu dake*  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I can feel it.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I've gained my own form.  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*I’ve never, not even a little, longed to have eternity / eien nado sukoshi mo hoshiku wa nai*  
  
  
**Mash:**   
My true wish, and my own identity, found over the course of this journey.  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*Every moment, every second, is so dear to me / ichibyou isshun ga itooshii*  
  
  
**Mash:**   
The journey on which I was born and came to life.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
And now it's my turn to give the world an answer.  
  
  
*--Song--*  
  
*Because I’m alive right here in this world with you / anata ga iru sekai ni watashi mo ikiteru*  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Would you please hold my hand?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Thank you... so much...  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Today we will conduct the Rayshift to the Seventh Singularity.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Once again...  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I am setting out on a journey.
