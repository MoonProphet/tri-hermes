# Moonlight Lostroom OVA  
  
**Announcement:**   
Announcement to all Chaldea staff.  
  
  
**Announcement:**   
The workday ends at 5:00 p.m.  
  
  
**Announcement:**   
A special arrangement thanks to our Acting Director.  
  
  
**Announcement:**   
This isn't due to Christmas holiday, but be sure to get a good rest.  
  
  
**Announcement:**   
Also, the Inspection Committee seems to be delayed, but they will be here once the weather allows it.  
  
  
**Announcement:**   
Their ETA is tomorrow at 12 o'clock.  
  
  
**Announcement:**   
We expect all of Chaldea's staff to receive them with modesty and pride.  
  
  
**Announcement:**   
Our functions are to be handled by the new staff once 2017 ends, but keep doing your job diligently as possible until then.  
  
  
**Duston:**   
The inspection will begin soon.  
  
  
**Duston:**   
What about you guys, will you leave for Clock Tower?  
  
  
**Male Chaldea staff:**   
I'll be going back to London.  
  
  
**Male Chaldea staff:**   
It's not like I really want to go back, but the situation here isn't any better.  
  
  
**Male Chaldea staff:**   
This organization has ties to the UN after all.  
  
  
**Female Chaldea staff:**   
I'd like to stay here.  
  
  
**Female Chaldea staff:**   
We have high-end equipment, and I've grown fond of this place after protecting it for over a year.  
  
  
**Female Chaldea staff:**   
And I don't really think the new staff will be able to handle Chaldea that well.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Excuse me for a moment.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Mr. Duston, can I ask you something.  
  
  
**Duston:**   
No problem.  
  
  
**Duston:**   
Is something wrong, miss Kyrielight?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I had a transmission from Senpa– from Fujimaru Ritsuka, but I can't find him.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
And now the communication has been cut off.  
  
  
**Duston:**   
Fujimaru?  
  
  
**Duston:**   
Now that you say it, I couldn't see him in the cafeteria.  
  
  
**Male Chaldea staff:**   
He wasn't in the medical room nor in the simulator either.  
  
  
**Male Chaldea staff:**   
I locked the entry myself.  
  
  
**Female Chaldea staff:**   
Then I wasn't seeing things...  
  
  
**Female Chaldea staff:**   
There's a warehouse behind the Control Room, right?  
  
  
**Female Chaldea staff:**   
It was a break room before remodeling.  
  
  
**Female Chaldea staff:**   
If I'm not mistaken, Ritsuka was around there.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Thank you for your help. But...  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Is there something wrong with that warehouse?  
  
  
**Duston:**   
Nothing, it's just weird to see people around there.  
  
  
**Duston:**   
The Lost Room is there, after all.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Lost Room...?  
  
  
**Duston:**   
It'll sound like a ghost story.  
  
  
**Duston:**   
They say people disappear when they enter at midnight.  
  
  
**Duston:**   
And this isn't an isolated incident, there are many reports about it.  
  
  
**Duston:**   
Now it's no more than a warehouse, a forgotten relic from the previous Director's era.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
You want to reorganize humanity based in the caste system?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I won't allow a society where my destiny is set in stone from the moment I was born!  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Go, Berserker!  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Director!  
  
  
**Olga:**   
What did you expect?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Who do you think I am?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I'm Chaldea's Director and owner of the Celestial Body Department in Clock Tower!  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I'm Olga Marie Animusphere!  
  
  
**Olga:**   
If we talk about Master potential, you of all people shouldn't be that surprised!  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Director, above!  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Look above!  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Heroic Spirits from the Age of Gods aren't needed anymore.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
This planet now belongs to humanity.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
It's too late for gods to claim ownership over it!  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Archer! Caster!  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Good grief, at this rate I'll have to take care of everything.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Mashu...? Fujimaru...?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Where did you go?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Perhaps I didn't do well as a Master?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Tell me! What does this mean!?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Was I asleep...?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
It feels like I had a weird dream.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Can we continue now, Olga?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Lev...?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Y-Yeah... Go on.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
What is it?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
It's about the unknown location observed by CHALDEAS the other day, Director.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
That was it.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
It's an alarming situation indeed.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
At this rate, it will become a Singularity disturbing human history.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I wonder if I should report this to the Association and the UN...  
  
  
**Lev:**   
I believe it's too soon for that.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Maybe CHALDEAS isn't working properly.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
It's been eleven years since it began operations in 2004.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
How about trying a maintenance?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
That won't do.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
CHALDEAS is a pseudo-celestial body copying the Earth's soul.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Stopping CHALDEAS is the same as killing it.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
To begin with, my CHALDEAS lacks any imperfection.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
If it has a problem, the reason must be an external factor.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
An external factor...  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Then, if CHALDEAS isn't at fault, the issue must be in the Observation Lens SHEBA.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Oh? It would be my fault if that's the case.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
It's true that my SHEBA has been working for 10 years.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Perhaps its theory isn't up to date.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I never said I had complaints towards you, Lev!  
  
  
**Olga:**   
There's the possibility of the staff in the Control Room overlooking something...  
  
  
**Olga:**   
...due to the Association harassing them all the time.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
The staff is completely healthy.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
If you ask me, the one who should take a day off is you, Director.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
I agree.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
You haven't been sleeping properly since we discovered this anomaly one week ago.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Let the doctors check your condition.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Aside from Leyshift experiment report, the report for the selection of Masters candidates is also finished.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
So, please use the next twelve hours to rest as much as you can.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
We don't have a replacemente for you, Director.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Alright, I'll take your advice.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Speaking of rest, proffesor Lev must be sleeping well.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I've heard that going to bed and waking up early it's healthy.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
That? Because my work was very exhausting before coming to Chaldea.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Once I completed SHEBA, I stopped seeing dreams.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
That's why I can sleep soundly at night now.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
What about you, Romani?  
  
  
**Romani:**   
It's the opposite for me.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Since I came here, all I see are dreams.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
But the dreams are always different.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
The Organization for the Preservation of Human Order, Chaldea.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
An organization established by my father in order to ensure the future.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
The Animuspheres are a magi family that have studied the celestial bodies from long ago.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
The mission of this family, of the Animuspheres, is to establish the thesis of the Grand Order.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
That is, to guarantee the human history on this planet.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
We see into the future to ensure that human history will continue beyond the present.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
We don't aim for something big like "creating the future."  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Our mission is to guarantee that "there is a future," and pass that onto other magi.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
For that reason, the Animusphere created this Mystic Code.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Pseudo-Celestial Body, CHALDEAS.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Assuming the planet had a soul, we copied that soul and put it inside this model of the Earth.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
But, we can't interfere with this second Earth.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
That's because its phase it's different.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Still, it's possible to analyze it.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
My father configured CHALDEAS one hundred years into the future.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
As long as the light of civilization shines in CHALDEAS, we can assure the survival of humanity for the next one hundred years.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
At the same time, CHALDEAS works as a library of Earth.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
We can't observe in detail the future one hundred years ahead.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Because the future is always changing.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
However, details of the confirmed past can be extracted.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
It's a compass pointing towards the past of humanity, so to speak.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
The success rate of sending someone to the past via Leyshifting after quantum decomposition...  
  
  
**Olga:**   
...raises dramatically thanks to CHALDEAS.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
My father founded Chaldea in order to observe and operate CHALDEAS.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
He was a great researcher and a great magus.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
That was my father... he left me alone after passing away three years ago.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
His dead body was found in his office, back in 2012.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I don't even know if he had an accidental death or if he had an illness.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I was just a little girl who took over Chaldea after his death.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
My father didn't leave me anything.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
But I did receive his conviction as a magus of Animusphere.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
It has been two years since I became Director.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
And just when I thought I was finally starting to get things done...  
  
  
**Mash:**   
But, why one hundred years into the future?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
What do you mean, Mashu?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I mean, if the only thing that matters is to see that civilization continues, why not set it to one day or one year after?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
It's about response time, Mashu.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
If we set it to one day, there's nothing we can do if the light of civilization disappears.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
There's no solution.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
However, if the destruction comes one or ten years later, that's time enough to act.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
I believe the previous Director set it in one hundred years to give humanity enough time to prepare.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I see now.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
The previous Director thought things through.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
B-But of course!  
  
  
**Olga:**   
My father was a very prudent and thoughtful person!  
  
  
**Olga:**   
He didn't act based on speculations nor wishful thinking.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
That's true.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
The Heroic Spirit Summoning System must be there for situations like that, too.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
If an abnormality emerged in the past, it would be impossible for us in the present to fix it.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
At least not if you don't go directly to that era to solve it.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Even if Leyshift succeeds, you can only send a magus by himself.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Once in that location, there's no weapons to rely on.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
For that reason you need Heroic Spirits, the Servants.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Heroic Spirits exist as they're an extension of human history, in spite of how much it can change.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
By borrowing their power, you can hold your ground in any era.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
So, that's how it is.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Heroic Spirits are spiritual phenomenons of higher order.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
The Throne of Heroes lies in a dimension above our own.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
They're beings that transcend time.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Just like Chaldea, they're a security mechanism to protect The Human Order.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
Because, as long as you make a contract with them, they can be summoned into any era.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
The Heroic Spirit Summoning System isn't stable yet.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
And first we must secure those Master candidates with high Leyshift aptitude.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I must make sure to verify that information...  
  
  
**Lev:**   
I wish Da Vinci were more cooperative with our cause.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Olga, what about giving him...  
I mean, her, a workshop?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Not yet.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I can't trust a Masterless Servant.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Besides, I can't deal with that Heroic Spirit.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Once we accomplish another summoning,  
I'll have her leave immediately.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
That's harsh.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
I've heard Da Vinci-chan sees you as her little sister.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
We should leave Da Vinci in charge of the Heroic Spirit Summoning.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
So we can focus in the Masters selection.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Olga, are you done choosing the A-Team?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Yes.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
"I recommend these seven magi if an emergency arises."  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Those were the orders my father left.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Father ordered to call them Crypters instead of Master candidates.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Director...  
  
  
**Mash:**   
What's this?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
It doesn't seem like it was made here in Chaldea.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
That...  
  
  
**Olga:**   
How weird... it was supposed to be under strict security measures.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
My apologies.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Is this something important?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Don't worry, we don't use it anymore.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
It's one of the presents from the Atlas Institute.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
The Atlas Institute?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
The ones who provided the blueprint for the TRISMEGISTUS....  
  
  
**Mash:**   
...resting at the core of Chaldea? Them?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Yes.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
The place where the definitive weapons of the world of magecraft are stored.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
The Pit of Taboo... The Atlas Institute.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
My father had a deal with Atlas, and based on it, they had to provide us with technology.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
That's how we got the Pseudo-Quantum Processor: TRISMEGISTUS.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
The other one was that...  
  
  
**Olga:**   
The Imaginary Numbers Observation System: PAPER MOON.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
PAPER MOON...  
  
  
**Lev:**   
A plane moon, perhaps?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
It's my first time hearing of it.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
So, what does it do?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
It's a compass that allows you to demonstrate and observe the Imaginary Numbers realm.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
It was prepared as a means to exceed CHALDEAS' phase contrast.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Although, it isn't need anymore.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Because SHEBA was completed and we could accomplish Leyshifting.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm surprised.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
There is another way to interfere with Singularities besides Leyshifting?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Yes.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
By diving into the realm of Imaginary Numbers to later resurface in the appointed location.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
We called it Zero Sail.  
  
  
**Romani:**   
And the ship that made that possible was the Shadow Border.  
Keep the secret.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
I get it.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
There was a machine unused thanks to me finishing SHEBA.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
You got me there.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
I can't help but feel that I wasn't really needed.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Lev...?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
It's just a thought.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Maybe it's a bit sudden, but that's how things are.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Let's say it took me by surprise.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Olga, I completed the Near-Future Observation Lens SHEBA back in 1999.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
That's when I accepted Marisbilly's invitation.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
My destiny was determined at that moment.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
To save humanity...  
  
  
**Lev:**   
No, that's wrong.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
To make this planet a better place.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
That became the goal of my life.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Before and after this incident.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
The future that humans build is versatile and keeps changing.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
That's why there's no stability.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Humanity's existence is wonderful, but they carry a big burden.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Wouldn't it be bad if it collapses like a mountain of pebbles?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
That's exactly what I want to avoid.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
I can't do much by myself.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
But, at least I can stop one of those pebbles before crumbling.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
What about you?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Do you want to be part of that big burden?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Do you want to carry that burden?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Or maybe you want to keep away those pebbles from your feet.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I...  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I'm none of that.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
This big duty of preserving the Human Order only brings me anxiety.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I don't give a damn about the future and its importance.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
All I have is this obsession to demonstrate that I'm capable of doing it.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Everyday is painful...  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Everyday, there's no future...  
  
  
**Olga:**   
What will I do once the end comes...?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Is there a way for me to be happy...?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I don't know at all what my purpose should be...  
  
  
**Olga:**   
This is so...  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Oh, look at the time.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Pardon my discourtesy, but I'll be very busy from now on.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Are you Olga Marie?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
My name is Lev Lainur, nice to meet you.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
Oh? Without shaking hands?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
It's fine, I like that attitude.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
It takes time to trust others.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
What? I dress weird?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
It looks off?  
  
  
**Lev:**   
But of course.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
I'm the only here who dresses old-fashioned.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
It's my pride as a magus trying to display courtesy towards the history of the Animuspheres.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
This may be a modern place, but it's also the workshop of the Animuspheres.  
  
  
**Lev:**   
So, even if it's only me, it's natural to dress like a magus.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Okay.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Goodbye, Lev Lainur.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Good morning.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Are you in your break too, Senpai?  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
I see everybody was here.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I'll give you something to drink, what would you like?  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Only tea.  
  
  
**Furjimaru:**   
Excuse me.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
It's not like I'm worried, but you look gloomy.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Is there something bothering you?  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
It's about my lack of skill.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
That's obvious.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
You were picked only to fill in numbers.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
You aren't a magus nor a soldier.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Just an average joe.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I'd have never given you the chance to fight if you weren't the last remaining candidate.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
For you to receive such an important duty as protecting humanity's future is–  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Even so...  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
I can't keep getting saved by everyone else.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
First, I must get things done by myself.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
And I've been working hard for it...  
  
  
**Olga:**   
You...  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
The more time passes, the more I realise how ordinary I am...  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
It doesn't matter how much I train, or how many spells I learn...  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
From time to time, I ask myself...  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
"Why me? I bet they have someone more qualified."  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
That kind of unpleasant thought.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Do you believe it was a mistake to become a Master?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
You've been doing it reluctantly because there's no one else to do it?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Good...  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I should crush him now...  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Anyways.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Those who don't even try are those who can't accomplish anything.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
If you can't get out of the situation...  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
At least make yourself stronger.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Even as an ordinary person, I'll be useless if I at least don't show off my mediocrity.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
I'm not someone's substitute.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
I want to meet everyone's expectations by being myself.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I'm disappointed.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
How can we trust the future of humanity to such weakling?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
The restoration of Human Order went to your head.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Maybe my judgement was wrong.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Still, we made it this far thanks to you, Director.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
We could complete Fuyuki's Order thanks to you.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
We were able to eliminate the Singularities in France, Rome and Okeanos...  
  
  
**Mash:**   
...because you were our navigator.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I did that with you...?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Mashu, what year is this...?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
It's May 1st, 2016.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Director?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Are you feeling bad?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
It's nothing.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Thanks, Mashu.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
I regret not talking with you like this earlier.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Fujimaru.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Will you keep going in spite of your fear?  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Well...  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
I'm not discouraged enough as to give up.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Is that so?  
  
  
**Olga:**   
There's nothing else for me to do, but I'll root for you anyways.  
  
  
**Olga:**   
Even if your future gets replaced by something completely hopeless.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
By the way...  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Who was that?  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
She's nobody.  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
She's someone who couldn't reach this future.  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
Give up.  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
There's no Human Order to protect anymore.  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
Listen, drifter who came from a faraway future... no, from the correct history.  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
You can't win.  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
The human world will be destroyed.  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
The future has already been decided.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
I knew of someone who said the same...  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
But, that was just an empty theory.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
The future will always be a blank sheet as long as there's someone willing to fight!  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
I won't let that happen!  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
You're right.  
  
  
Because the future literally became a blank sheet.  
**Galahad:**   
  
  
**Galahad:**   
It would be better if there were something to incinerate, because at least there would be something.  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
But, this planet even let go of that residue.  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
Humanity is at a stalemate.  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
This is the future one year from now that was decided once you stopped the Incineration of the Human Order.  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
This is how planet Earth looks.  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
The King of Magecraft once said...  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
"You would be happier by not doing anything."  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
Let me repeat those words again.  
  
  
**Galahad:**   
Our history shall not continue onto the future.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Because... we restored the Human Order...?  
  
  
**Voice of Romani:**   
Wake up, Fujimaru.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Sorry! I overslept!  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Huh...?  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
I only came to leave my stuff here and I fell asleep...  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Even though the whole Chaldea staff is very busy cleaning things up...  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai!  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I couldn't find you neither in your room nor in the cafeteria...  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I was a bit worried.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Did you go to the warehouse?  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Yeah.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
I was sorting out the sheets and tablewares I used until now.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
It doesn't feel right to just throw them away.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Isn't the new staff from the Association arriving soon?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes. They will arrive by helicopter once the weather allows it.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
Their ship is anchored on the coast.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Really?  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
We went through a lot in one year, but it was worth it.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Thank you, Mashu.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Thank you for always supporting such a mediocre Master.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I... I should be the one saying it!  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm conscious I've been supported many times and far longer than Senpai!  
  
  
**Mash:**   
The objective of the inspection is obvious.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
The old Chaldea will be disbanded and the staff will be renewed.  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I wonder if I'll be able to be in the same department as you...  
  
  
**Mash:**   
To begin with, will you stay at Chaldea!?  
  
  
**Mash:**   
If you're going back to Japan, please give me your address!  
  
  
**Mash:**   
I'd like to send you a New Year's greeting card and the like...!  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
The Inspection Committee will arrive soon...  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
And with that, my unbelievable days at Chaldea will come to an end.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
I don't know what will happen from now on.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
It would make me happy to get a job at Chaldea, even if not as a Master.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Though, I know that won't be easy.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
But, it doesn't matter what happens.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
It doesn't matter how uncertain the future looks.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
I believe there's nothing to be afraid of.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Humans are fundamentally powerless, and things rarely work out well.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Usually it's all in vain, and it's normal to just laugh it off saying something like...  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
"Things like that happen, you know."  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
I know... that kind of strength was what helped me in this short yet long journey.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
For the time being, there must still be things that only I can do.  
  
  
**Fujimaru:**   
Let's welcome the New Year without doubting that.
