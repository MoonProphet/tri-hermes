**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's all the commotion about?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
TTGs are the new hotness in Chaldea right now, Senpai. We should investigate this matter ourselves.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
TTGs?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.  
It's an abbreviation for “tabletop games.”  
  
**Mash:**   
The database says that while TTGs encompass a wide variety of genres, including dice, cards, and role-playing, they typically refer to board games, which are the kind that Chaldea is currently caught up in.  
  
**Mash:**   
While I haven't played many of them myself, I do know that some of the most famous board games include chess, shogi, go, and checkers.  
  
**Mash:**   
In particular, board games have a very long history, with some of them dating back to ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Roman Empire.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You want to try them, don't you?  
  
**Mash:**   
Y-yes, I would be very interested  
to give them a shot, but...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I didn't know the abbreviation,but I am actually something of a TTG fan myself.  
  
**Mash:**   
Really? Then you'll have to introduce  
me to some of your favorites.  
  
**Mash:**   
...But not right now, I'm afraid.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
As you can see, the cafeteria has kind of been taken over by other avid TTG fans, some of whom are prone to rather, um, heated disagreements...  
  
**Kid Gil:**   
I just turned the hourglass over. Now you have to solve the puzzle before it runs out of&ndash;  
  
**Abigail:**   
Ubongo...  
  
**Beni-Enma:**   
You solved it already, chirp!?  
  
**Chloe:**   
Gnn...!  
  
**Illya:**   
Are you kidding me!? No way!  
This really isn't my thing!  
  
**Kid Gil:**   
Don't worry, it's easy.  
Just move this piece over here, and&ndash;  
  
**Chloe:**   
Hey! No helping!  
  
**Blackbeard:**   
#### Hwaaah!  
  
**Anne & Mary:**   
“Hwah”?  
  
**Drake:**   
What kinda weird battle cry is that!? Can't you just go with “Yarrr!” like a normal pirate!?  
  
**Blackbeard:**   
I wasn't being weird! I just couldn't stop  
my aura from exploding out of me any longer!  
  
**Bartholomew:**   
I get it. You got the prompt for building up power, right?  
  
**Blackbeard:**   
Exactly!!! I knew you would understand,  
my brother from another mother!  
  
**Mary:**   
Wait. You just gave away the answer.  
  
**Anne:**   
I guess all he really wants is attention.  
  
**Columbus:**   
Hmm, I'm still not feeling this sound charade game.  
If I'd wanted to perform, I would've gone into showbiz.  
  
**Columbus:**   
'Course, I don't mind putting on a little razzle-dazzle if it helps move merchandise, but that ain't what's going on here.  
  
**Columbus:**   
How 'bout a different game?  
We got any where you get a chance to strike it rich?  
  
**Bartholomew:**   
I believe this offers something like that. It's all  
about setting sail for new lands in search of gold.  
  
**Columbus:**   
Perfect! Now that's what I'm talking about!  
Let's go get ourselves some treasure!  
  
**Drake:**   
You're on, Spaniard!  
No way I'm letting you win this one!  
  
**Blackbeard:**   
Really? It's over, just like that? You're not even  
gonna comment on my heartfelt performance?  
  
**Blackbeard:**   
...Psych! Nobody beats Blackbeard in a treasure hunt!  
  
**Ortlinde:**   
Okay, so this is our field of vision... And this is the incidence orientation modifier... So, since we're inside the atmosphere, this changes to... Huh?  
  
**Hildr:**   
...I don't get it. Any of it.  
  
**Hildr:**   
But I do kind of like the way it hunches  
down when it's in hovering mode.  
  
**Thrúd:**   
Am I understanding this? Are we really about to fly off the map without ever getting to fight a single battle?  
  
**Ortlinde:**   
I think this game might be a little too realistic.  
  
**Ortlinde:**   
I mean, if not even we Valkyries can manage  
to get off the ground with these systems...  
  
**Thrúd:**   
I can't believe things like inertia management and three-dimensional movement are giving us so much trouble in this game. In real life, they're so intuitive that we don't even have to think about them...  
  
**Hildr:**   
You guys are too hung up on close-quarter dogfights.  
The flashy Circus action's gonna be in midair combat!  
  
**Ortlinde:**   
It won't matter what kind of fighting it is if we can't get our units to go or aim where they're supposed to!  
  
**Hildr:**   
I'm gonna try hunching down too... How's this?   
Am I doing it? ...Wait. Ouch! This really does a number on your lower back!  
  
**Medjed?:**  
Is that shogi piece supposed to be me?  
  
**Pārvatī:**   
Nito&ndash;I mean, Medjed, was it?  
  
**Pārvatī:**   
Oh, now that you mention it, you do look  
just like this ghost piece, don't you?  
  
**Ishtar:**   
So? It's just a coincidence, right? Or what, have you actually been a ghost this whole time or something?  
  
**Medjed?:**  
Insolence! How dare you!  
  
**Ishtar:**   
Hey! What's the big idea, flipping over our board!?  
I had her right where I wanted her!  
  
**Medjed?:**  
This is divine justice at work!  
  
**Ishtar:**   
You're pulling the divine justice card on ME!?  
You've got guts. I'll give you that!  
  
**Pārvatī:**   
Now, now, there's no need for dramatics here. Why don't you join us for the next game, Nito&ndash;uh, Medjed?  
  
**Pārvatī:**   
I think you'll find it has a lot in common with  
the ancient game Queen Nefertari used to enjoy.  
  
**Medjed?:**  
Huh!? O-oh no, I couldn't dare do anything so...  
&ndash;I mean, very well then! I won't lose!  
  
**Ishtar:**   
Oho, so you want to settle this on the game board, do you? Fine by me!  
  
**Pārvatī:**   
Hehe. Then let's go ahead and put everything  
back where it belongs, shall we?  
  
**Pārvatī:**   
(I think it'd be best if I kept the fact that  
I was one move away from checkmate to myself.)  
  
**Yang Guifei:**   
(Fidgeting nervously)  
  
**Sanzang:**   
Wow, I had no idea there were so many variations on Xiangqi&ndash;I mean Chinese chess&ndash;made after it came to China from India.  
  
**Sanzang:**   
Just look at all these adorable animal pieces!  
I especially love the giraffe and the chick!  
  
**Wu Zetian:**   
Hmm. I can certainly see the sense in sending  
lions and elephants off to war...  
  
**Wu Zetian:**   
But a chick? As in a baby chicken!?  
Are you even trying to defeat me!?  
  
**Yang Guifei:**   
(Fidgeting nervously)  
  
**Wu Zetian:**   
By the way... You there.  
Why do you keep fidgeting like that!?  
  
**Yang Guifei:**   
Eep! GrandmSister Nite-Brite!?  
  
**Sanzang:**   
Hm? Tamamo Cat? Is that you back there behind Yu-Yu?  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Sure is!  
  
**Wu Zetian:**   
Ulp. What is the meaning of this?  
Are you trying to incur my wrath!?  
  
**Yang Guifei:**   
I-it's not like that at all, Sister, I promise!  
  
**Yang Guifei:**   
Do you see Master over there so clearly  
yearning to join us?  
  
**Yang Guifei:**   
I decided that if I saw even the slightest  
sign that Master might begin to lose...  
  
**Yang Guifei:**   
I would put Tamamo Cat up on the  
board to ruin the game for good!  
  
**Wu Zetian:**   
Oh no you don't!  
There will be no cats on MY game's board!  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I'm gonna ruin the game even  
if it costs me Master's life!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Come forth, Nikogale Holmes the Great Chimera!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
...Did you just stick Nikola Tesla's right arm and Sherlock Holmes's left arm on Florence Nightingale's body, Stolfo?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Pretty perfect, huh!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
That's, uh...not the word I would have chosen...  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Aww, why not? Come on, you know how Nightingale's also  
known as the White Angel (read: Tyrant), don't you?  
  
**Nightingale:**   
You called?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
She's actually here!?  
  
**Nightingale:**   
Does someone require treatment?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Nnn, not exactly. We need full-blown operations.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
And, um...amputations, at that...  
  
**Nightingale:**   
Not to worry. I have plenty of experience with those. Now, where are the patients that require amputation? Is it you?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
What? No!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
It's Tesla and Holmes!  
(Said without a moment's hesitation)  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Are you nuts!?  
  
**Nightingale:**   
I'll begin the operation at once.  
  
**Bradamante & Astolfo:**   
...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Don't you dare go with her, Stolfo!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
C'mon, let me go!  
You're gonna make me miss the best part!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
This isn't a joke! Your little stunt is about  
to lead to unimaginable disaster! Again!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Hehe, then shouldn't you be sticking around?  
How else are you gonna make sure justice is served?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Well, uh... I would, except...  
Nightingale kind of scares me...  
  
**Moriarty:**   
I must say, it's been delightful engaging in a battle of wits with you again, old chap. Though, of course, I doubt this battle will be settled anytime soon, given the usual pace of a chess game.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Only if one assumes neither of us will make any mistakes.  
  
**Moriarty:**   
A fair point. Who can be said not to make the occasional mistake or have the odd accident? Even so, we are talking about YOU here.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Is that your way of saying this will be a protracted and evenly matched battle of wits? While that does indeed sound most engaging&ndash;  
  
**Nightingale:**   
Excuse me, Mr. Holmes.  
It's time for your emergency treatment.  
  
**Holmes:**   
Treatment? Perhaps there's been some misunderstanding? I'm quite sure I've been more moderate with my usage as of late...  
  
**Nightingale:**   
I'll be happy to hear any concerns you may have...  
AFTER your treatment has been administered!  
  
**Holmes:**   
Just a moment. I refuse to go anywhere without  
Watson, my primary physician, present!  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Farewell, Holmes. I'll see your final moments put to some good use in my memoirs. They will doubtless stir readers' curiosity and make me a bundle.  
  
**Holmes:**   
How dare you put out such a vile bootleg, Professor!? Whatever you do, you'd better not publish it under Watson's name!  
  
**Mash:**   
...There you have it, Senpai. It's basically like a TTG version of Gehenna, or maybe a chaotic coliseum.  
  
**Mash:**   
If you get too close without taking proper precautions, the constant invitations are liable to drive you mad and rob you of your ability to make sound judgmen&ndash;  
  
**Osakabehime:**   
Ooh, are you losing your way here too, Ma-chan?  
Don't try to resist. Give in to the dork side.  
  
**Ganesha:**   
Come on in!  
We're always happy for new blood around here!  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
I would be happy to be your opponent in any manner  
of game. Please, right this way.  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
Oh, to be clear, when I speak of games now, I refer to the analog variety rather than the digital one.  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
Video games are still wonderful, of course, but there is also a great deal to be said for competing face-to-face with wooden pieces you can feel with your own hands!  
  
**Mash:**   
What do you say, Master?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just for a little bit, okay?  
  
**Mash:**   
Right! It's just like they say:  
everything in moderation!  
  
**Osakabehime:**   
Sure, that's what everyone says. At first.  
  
**Ganesha:**   
Good thing I stocked up on snacks and juice ahead of time. C'mon, you can stay up all night with me and help me figure out this new mystery game I've been&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well, I certainly don't have anything against games.  
  
**Mash:**   
I had a feeling you'd say that!  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
Wonderful. Then let's see what you've got.  
  
**Ganesha:**   
Sweet! Then we're all set to do some serious gaming! And as luck would have it, I just happen to have acquired a copy of a new mystery game that&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Wait, I'm sorry.  
Did you say “mystery game”?  
  
**Edison:**   
Graaaaaah!  
  
**Mash:**   
Huh? Was that...Edison? What's going on?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Now what is it?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We should go take a look.  
  
---  
  
**Osakabehime:**   
No problem! Me and my game will still be here later.  
  
**Mash:**   
Thank you, Osakabehime!  
  
**Edison:**   
This makes no sense! How could my direct current and I have possibly lost!?  
  
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Hahahahahaha! Now do you understand, you mangy plebeian!? You now face the unvarnished historical truth!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's going on?  
  
---  
  
**Helena:**   
Oh, hello, Fujimaru.  
You picked a great time to show up.  
  
**Mash:**   
It sounded like there was some sort of problem here.  
Did they just finish a game?  
  
**Mash:**   
Things seem to be very tense around here...  
  
**Helena:**   
Don't worry. It's just business as usual.  
  
**Helena:**   
You know how Edison loves to stay on top of trends, right? In this case, it led to him trying his hand at a TTG.  
  
**Helena:**   
Still, everything was fine up until Tesla challenged him to the worst kind of game possible...  
  
**Mash:**   
What sort of game?  
  
**Helena:**   
It's called “Current Wars.” Of all the games they could have played, it had to be one that recreates their own real-life attempts to drag each other down...  
  
**Mash:**   
I see... That definitely doesn't sound like the kind of game where they could settle their differences in a single round.  
  
**Edison:**   
Damn half-witted eccentric! How dare you employ such deviousness to drag direct current's good name through the mud!?  
  
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Don't blame me. The weaker option will always give way to the stronger one. It is only natural. This was inevitable, no matter how many simulations one chooses to run.  
  
**Nikola Tesla:**   
And they have proclaimed loud and clear that alternating current is civilization's best friend! So, now that it has been proven to be the right path to take humanity to the stars and beyon&ndash;  
  
**Nightingale:**   
Excuse me, Mr. Tesla, but it's time for your operation.  
  
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Hm? What's this about? Do you need electricity for it? And by electricity, I of course mean alternating current.  
  
**Nightingale:**   
No. All I need is your right arm.  
  
**Nikola Tesla:**   
That's an oddly specific request... But, very well. My lightning and I shall be there to help you at once!  
  
**Helena:**   
...W-well, I don't know what that was all about, but at least we don't have to worry about things getting out of hand now.  
  
**Mash:**   
True, though I also can't help but  
worry about Tesla a little...  
  
**Edison:**   
Don't bother worrying about that half-wit!  
Just be glad he's finally gone! I know I am!  
  
**Edison:**   
On a different subject, I have to say I don't care for these board game things. In fact, I consider them an outright eyesore.  
  
**Helena:**   
Only because you've not actually won one, right?  
  
**Edison:**   
How could these things possibly be any good if they don't let the obviously correct choice prevail even once!?  
  
**Helena:**   
Yes, yes, let's just leave it at that. I swear,  
I'd love to know where you get your confidence from.  
  
**Edison:**   
At any rate, it's abundantly clear that these  
newfangled games are a complete waste of time!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
I'm with you. The only thing worse than a game played alone is one you have to play with other people.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Disagreements are meant to be resolved on the battlefield. Bringing them home is just crazy.  
  
**Helena:**   
Oh great. Now we've got this guy. He seems like he'd turn every game he plays into some kind of death match...  
  
**Mash:**   
T-true, he certainly isn't the kind of person I expected to show up here. I think he may only add fuel to the proverbial fire.  
  
**Edison:**   
Wonderful! I don't know who you are, friend,  
but I'm delighted to find a like-minded compatriot!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
You want to add me to your friends list? Request denied. Anyway, why don't you tell them how it really is?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
All games are meaningless diversions. They're nothing but pathetic time killers for hypocrites. No matter how much you play them, they'll never leave you with anything of value.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
They're practically the devil himself tempting you away from focusing on things that really matter, and they should all be regulated out of existence.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
That's what you really want to say, isn't it?  
  
**Edison:**   
Hmm, I don't know.  
That might be going a bit too far, even for me...  
  
**Helena:**   
There we go. Let's just leave it at that for now, shall we? Besides, plenty of things out there have more value than you might expect.  
  
**Helena:**   
It's not like ONLY the things you can see and touch, or that endure forever, have value in this world!  
  
**Helena:**   
Some people find games to be the most fulfilling thing life has to offer, while others find fulfillment by living life as though it were a game. There's nothing wrong with any of that.  
  
**Helena:**   
For example, Edison, did you know some people refer to your and Nikola's engineering battles as a game played between geniuses?  
  
**Edison:**   
Gnnn... Easy for them to say!  
  
**Mash:**   
Now I see... So that's why there's even a board game based on their conflict.  
  
**Mash:**   
So TTGs offer people an opportunity to pit their wits against another's, pushing each other to greater heights than they could reach on their own.  
  
**Mash:**   
If that's true, it doesn't seem right to just do away with them all and say they're a waste of time.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
You said it! I couldn't agree more!  
  
**Mash:**   
Da Vinci!  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
There's nothing at all wrong with games. In fact, they're great at getting people to practice thinking things through and taking calculated risks.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
But, as in all things, moderation is key.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is there a problem?  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
I'm glad you asked. We've kind of got something  
of a bizarre phenomenon on our hands.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What brings you here?  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Something pretty odd, as it turns out.  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
In general, I'm on board with that.  
  
**Mash:**   
Da Vinci!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
There's nothing at all wrong with games. In fact, they're great at getting people to practice thinking things through and taking calculated risks.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
But, as in all things, moderation is key.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is something wrong?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm glad you asked. We've kind of got something  
of a bizarre phenomenon on our hands.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What brings you here?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Something pretty odd, as it turns out.  
  
---  
  
**Osakabehime:**   
Is this about that mysterious new game?  
  
**Mash:**   
Mysterious game? Now that you mention it, I do think I recall someone mentioning something along those lines...  
  
**Ganesha:**   
Yeah, someone left it just lying around here. No idea who owns it or even how to play it, since it doesn't come with a manual. All we know for sure is it comes in five, count 'em, FIVE boxes!  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
It appears to be a standard board game that has been customized with an assortment of house rules, so there is nothing stopping us from playing it.  
  
**Helena:**   
I'm sensing something kind of ominous about it.  
  
**Edison:**   
Hmm. A board game that spontaneously appeared  
on its own, huh... Bizarre, but fascinating.  
  
**Mash:**   
Have you all already played it?  
  
**Osakabehime:**   
Mochicourse. I mean, what's the point of discovering a new game if you're not going to try it?  
  
**Ganesha:**   
Hell, the mechanics are so crazy deep that we were about to stay up all night trying them all out!  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
I can understand being curious about the unknown, but I'm a little concerned at how...engrossing it's proven to be.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How bad is it?  
  
---  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
I think you'd better see for yourself.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Come with me.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I can understand being curious about the unknown, but I'm a little concerned at how...engrossing it's proven to be.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How bad is it?  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I think you'd better see for yourself.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Come with me.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Oh boy, it's plundering time!  
Your lumber is mine now, Maria!  
  
**Marie:**   
How could you, Amadeus!? You didn't have to use lumber! You could have made do with bricks just as easily, you big jerk!  
  
**Mash:**   
That's the closest Marie has ever come to using profanity...! Something definitely isn't right here, Senpai! They all look as though they've been possessed!  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Hey, guys?  
How many days has it been since you got any sleep?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey, guys?  
How many days has it been since you got any sleep?  
  
**Marie:**   
If you're talking about how much we need to sleep,  
that comes down to personal preference...  
  
**Marie:**   
But if you're talking about our magical energy reserves, I think we all still have plenty to spare.  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
I understand how you feel. It's all too easy to lose track of everything when one is caught up in a game.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Must be nice to be so oblivious.  
Or maybe the word I'm looking for is “greedy.”  
  
**Osakabehime:**   
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's all shut ourselves  
in and take the plunge into this game's world.  
  
**Helena:**   
Uh-oh. If I pursue this any further, I don't know if there'll be any coming back. But, then again...I can practically hear the Mystic calling to me!  
  
**Mash:**   
They all look like they're having the time of their lives... (Gulp)  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai, do you think...maybe we could  
join them, just for a round or two?  
  
**Ganesha:**   
Come ooon. Join uuus.  
  
**Osakabehime:**   
TTGs are awesooome. Trust meee.  
  
**Edison:**   
Nooo! They've all become completely addicted!  
  
**Edison:**   
This game is far too dangerous to leave unregulated! I'll have to put out a Presi-King executive order banning it forever!  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Yeah, you don't have that kind of authority here, and even if you did, the Heroic Spirits would never obey it. We're gonna have to figure out another solution to this problem...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Yeah, you don't have that kind of authority here, and even if you did, the Heroic Spirits would never obey it. We're gonna have to figure out another solution to this problem...  
  
**???:**  
...  
  
**Mash:**   
Huh? Senpai, do you recognize that child over there?  
I don't think I've seen him before...  
  
**???:**  
...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who are you?  
  
**???:**  
.........Me?  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where did you come from?  
  
**???:**  
.........Far away.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
That's strange. It almost feels like there's  
some kind of...lag in his responses.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
He came from inside that game.  
  
**Mash:**   
Um... Did you say from inside the game?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Yes, I did. I saw him come out myself.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
The game on the table jumped up all of a sudden, then the boy came tumbling right out!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Huh. First a mystery game, now a mystery boy. And if I'm not mistaken, he looks like he's a Servant, too.  
  
**D：???:**  
.........A game?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The place it looks like you came from.  
  
**D：???:**  
......You mean, the forest?  
Or......the desert?  
  
**Mash:**   
Forest? Desert?  
What do you think he's talking about, Senpai?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You mean you don't know?  
  
**D：???:**  
......I don't think so.  
That's why......got lost.  
  
**Mash:**   
Lost? So, you're a lost Servant?  
  
---  
  
**D：???:**  
...No, not me. I know the way.  
I'm not going to get lost.  
  
**D：???:**  
But she's different.  
She's always been lost.  
  
**D：???:**  
She never goes to the forest. She never drops to the desert. She just stays alone in the city, surrounded by people.  
  
**D：???:**  
That's why I came here, from where she is.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who are you talking about?  
  
---  
  
**D：???:**  
But you...are qualified.  
So you are...a special case.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
What is it you have there?  
You've been holding onto it this whole time, haven't you?  
  
**D：???:**  
......  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Why are you hiding it? Is it a secret?  
Is it something bad?  
  
**D：???:**  
...No.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Then why won't you let me see it?  
  
**D：???:**  
...Because you need to be...qualified.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Qualified?  
Is that why Fujimaru can see it, but I can't?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Qualifications, huh... Sounds like he's talking about Master aptitude. That would explain it.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Means the new kid really is a Servant then.  
(He sure doesn't look like a hero to me...)  
  
**Mash:**   
So, does this mean you're choosing  
Senpai to be your Master?  
  
**D：???:**  
...A...Master?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
You don't know what a Master is? Well that's strange.  
Why did you come here, anyway?  
  
**D：???:**  
...I'm still in the middle of a journey.  
Which is...exactly why I...  
  
**D：???:**  
Hey, [♂ mister /♀️ miss]? Would you look at this?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...What is it? A game piece?  
  
---  
  
**Edison:**   
Oho! This is exquisitely made.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Let me see! I want to see, too!  
  
**D：???:**  
......  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Hmph! How come Edison can see it, but I can't!?  
You're so mean!  
  
**D：???:**  
Because he's allowed...to see it.  
  
**Edison:**   
Oh?  
  
**D：???:**  
He's the one who led me to the stars.  
He's the one who set me on my journey.  
  
**Edison:**   
Aha! I've got it! I know what your True Name is now!  
  
**D：???:**  
You...remember me?  
  
**Edison:**   
But of course! You're Voyager!  
  
**Voyager:**   
...That's right. That is what some people called me.  
  
**Edison:**   
I knew it! You're Voyager, the unmanned space probe! Your launch into the outer reaches of our solar system was one of the most heroic feats humanity has ever accomplished!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Voyager... That's what they used to call people who explore the unknown on ships, right? But you're the actual ship?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...Yes. I'm a ship. Although...  
I can't carry any passengers.  
  
**Mash:**   
A space probe!?  
So, you're a Servant of an inanimate object?  
  
**Mash:**   
I mean, I know there have been other Servants who came about when the concepts of certain man-made creations became Heroic Spirits, but&ndash;  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Yes, exactly! People really do come up with  
all sorts of lovely dreams, don't they?  
  
**Edison:**   
It just goes to show how many people saw Voyager here as a true hero. Personally, I couldn't be prouder.  
  
**Edison:**   
He began his grand adventure in the summer of 1977,  
when he embarked on a journey across the sea of stars.  
  
**Edison:**   
In fact, his voyage even continues today, using the gravitational pull of passing planets to slingshot himself beyond the heliosphere...  
  
**Edison:**   
What an amazing accomplishment! And even now, his ultimate destination is still being updated! Why, your journey continues to expand humanity's map of the universe even as we speak!  
  
**Voyager:**   
...I'm not really sure what you're talking about.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
I see. So you're like a Pseudo-Servant that's a record of both the past and currently ongoing phenomena.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Pseudo-Servant...?  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Essentially, you're the embodiment of people's aspirations to reach outer space. You're the hope for a brighter future, a guide for all humanity, and the crystallized essence of the time when people believed in unhindered progress all rolled into one.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Would you mind if I took a look at your treasure too? It must really be something special.  
  
**Voyager:**   
......  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Aww, come on. Don't tell me you care more about your pledge to the Stars and Stripes than you do the Renaissance's uomo universale?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Now I see. So you're rather like a Pseudo-Servant.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Pseudo-Servant...?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Essentially, you're the embodiment of people's aspirations to reach outer space. You're the hope for a brighter future, a guide for all humanity, and the crystallized essence of the time when people believed in unhindered progress all rolled into one.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
As one of the Pioneers of the Stars myself, I have nothing but respect for you. So, would you mind if I took a look at your treasure too?  
  
**Voyager:**   
......  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Aww, come on. Don't tell me you care more about your pledge to the Stars and Stripes than you do the Renaissance's uomo universale?  
  
**Mash:**   
I can see why you'd be proud, Edison. It was the U.S.  
that came up with the Voyager plan, after all...  
  
**Edison:**   
Hahaha, of course it was! My homeland has always been at the forefront of progress and innovation!  
  
**Edison:**   
That being said, you yourself said you were still in the middle of your journey, Voyager. So what are you doing here?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
And why did you come out of a board game?  
Don't try to deny it. I saw the whole thing.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Is it 'cause you decided to end the game for good?  
If so, I wouldn't mind helping you out.  
  
**Voyager:**   
...I...  
  
**Voyager:**   
I...  
  
**Mash:**   
That's...the game piece he was holding onto.  
I think he wants you to take it, Senpai.  
  
**Edison:**   
You want to play this game? I'm afraid it's too late for that now. You'll just have to wait until tomorrow.  
  
**Voyager:**   
......  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Well look at you scowling back.  
Seems you mean business.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
So what is it you want?  
You trying to challenge us? Lure us in?  
  
**Voyager:**   
......  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
That's enough for now, Emiya. He's obviously just exhausted. Come on, Voyager, I'll show you the way to my workshop.  
  
**Voyager:**   
......  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
It's okay. There's nothing to be afraid of.  
I'm just going to run some tests on you, that's all.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Oh no! There's a bad person doing bad things here!  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Oh, stop it. This is well within the scope of my operations as Chaldea's technical advisor. Honestly, I'd love to bring back the mystery game and take a look at that, too...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
That's enough for now, Emiya. He's obviously just exhausted. Come on, Voyager, I'll show you the way to my workshop.  
  
**Voyager:**   
......  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
It's okay. There's nothing to be afraid of.  
I'm just going to run some tests on you, that's all.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Oh no! There's a bad person doing bad things here!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, stop it. This is well within the scope of my operations as Chaldea's technical advisor. Honestly, I'd love to bring back the mystery game and take a look at that, too...  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
...but something tells me they're not  
gonna be putting it down anytime soon.  
  
**Edison:**   
Be extra careful with him, all right? Voyager there is the pride and joy of all humanity, you know.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Don't worry, I'm well aware.  
  
**Voyager:**   
......  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
What is it, kid?  
If you got something to say, spit it out.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
You might be a Heroic Spirit, but it still only takes a second for an idea to die on the vine. Especially for you idealistic types.  
  
**Voyager:**   
...I...  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
...  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Well, good night, everyone. Sweet dreams.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I want to go where she is&ndash;  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...but something tells me they're not  
gonna be putting it down anytime soon.  
  
**Edison:**   
Be extra careful with him, all right? Voyager there is the pride and joy of all humanity, you know.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Don't worry, I'm well aware.  
  
**Voyager:**   
......  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
What is it, kid?  
If you got something to say, spit it out.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
You might be a Heroic Spirit, but it still only takes a second for an idea to die on the vine. Especially for you idealistic types.  
  
**Voyager:**   
...I...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, good night, everyone. Sweet dreams.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I want to go where she is&ndash;  
  
**Mash:**   
Voyager certainly is a mysterious boy, isn't he?  
  
**Mash:**   
He clearly has a will of his own...but he talks as though there's a constant time barrier getting in between us.  
  
**Mash:**   
...I also noticed he kept looking directly at you, Senpai.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe I should've accepted what he wanted to give me.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
No, I think you made the right choice there, Senpai. Da Vinci was indirect about it, but she warned us to be careful around him.  
  
**Mash:**   
There's still a lot we just don't  
know about Voyager, after all.  
  
**Mash:**   
But...it did pain me to have to refuse.  
  
**Mash:**   
He looked so earnest... I can't imagine that  
all he wants is to just play a game.  
  
**Mash:**   
I wonder what he was trying to tell us...  
  
**Mash:**   
Hopefully Da Vinci will be able to figure  
out the lag issue in her workshop.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I wonder who he was so concerned about...  
  
**Mash:**   
Right. It seemed like it was bothering him a lot.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'll have to go over it in detail tomorrow.  
  
**Mash:**   
Absolutely.  
  
---  
  
**:**  
                            – The Next Morning –  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai, come quick! It's the Servants!  
  
**Mash:**   
#### They've all gone missing!  
  
**Mash:**   
Given the cafeteria's state of disarray, I can only imagine they must have simply disappeared while they were still caught up in their all-night game night.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Hey there, Fujimaru.  
I'm afraid it's just as bad as it looks.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
All the Servants who were having a blast in here last night are nowhere to be seen.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where did everyone go?  
  
---  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Far as I can tell, they made a Spiritron dive to a different phase of existence in something strangely similar to a Rayshift.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
It seems they were trapped inside a board game.  
Specifically, that mysterious new one.  
  
**Mash:**   
A game that traps Servants...! I think I remember something like that happening before!  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
I've been trying to contact the trapped Servants, but so far, no, uh, dice. And I doubt they'll be able to make it back on their own, either.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
So yes, as Mash said, it looks like they've  
all been trapped inside this game.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey there, Fujimaru.  
I'm afraid it's just as bad as it looks.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
All the Servants who were having a blast in here last night are nowhere to be seen.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where did everyone go?  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Far as I can tell, they made a Spiritron dive to a different phase of existence in something strangely similar to a Rayshift.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
It seems they were trapped inside a board game.  
Specifically, that mysterious new one.  
  
**Mash:**

**Da Vinci:**   
I've been trying to contact the trapped Servants, but so far, no, uh, dice. And I doubt they'll be able to make it back on their own, either.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
So yes, as Mash said, it looks like they've  
all been trapped inside this game.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Oh my! So they all got so caught up in that game they've fallen head over heels for it&ndash;or, well, into it!  
  
**Edison:**   
I knew it!  
I knew we should have banned all games for good!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
You had the right idea. You just didn't act on  
it soon enough. But hey, this works out nicely.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Now that all those lazy Servants are gone, Chaldea's overall ability to plan and execute has gone way up.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't care! We've still gotta save them!  
  
**Mash:**   
Right! We need to bring everyone back  
as soon as possible! But...how?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can the bad boy routine, Alter. Not the time.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
It's not a routine.  
I'm just saying what everyone's thinking.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Still, a job's a job. If the objective's  
to save them, then that's what I'll do.  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**Voyager:**   
...I can go.  
Want to...go with me?  
  
**Mash:**   
Voyager!  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Oh yeah, I haven't mentioned that yet, have I? Voyager here's a Foreigner&ndash;a visitor from another world. And according to eyewitness testimony, he came from inside this very game.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh yeah, I haven't mentioned that yet, have I? Voyager here's a Foreigner&ndash;a visitor from another world. And according to eyewitness testimony, he came from inside this very game.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
It's true. I saw him myself.  
  
**Mash:**   
Voyager...  
Does this mean you can take us inside the game?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...If you want to come with me...  
...I'm sure I can take you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Me?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I see... That sounds like a kind of contract.  
  
**Mash:**   
And you did say last night that Senpai was qualified.  
  
**Mash:**   
So you meant that [♂ he /♀️ she] was qualified to go inside  
this mysterious game, as one of its players.  
  
**Voyager:**   
...I still don't know what you mean by “game,” but this place is complicated, and dangerous, and kind of fun.  
  
**Voyager:**   
It's also where we'll find her.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Come on, let's go.  
Here.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...You want me to take this?  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
Let's go. Together.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay. You got it!  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
I'm glad. You're...the kind of person I thought you were, lone Master of Chaldea.  
  
**Mash:**   
A golden light's surrounding Senpai and Voyager!  
They're both glowing and floating in the air!  
  
**Voyager:**   
Let me ask you something.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Are we...friends?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course!  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
Then let's go find her.  
  
**Mash:**   
Wait! Please, take me with you, too!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I can't just sit back and do nothing.  
I have to go after everyone, too.  
  
**Edison:**   
As Voyager's de facto legal guardian, I too have a responsibility to come along and ensure your safety!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
...Well, I can't let you run off with nothing but a couple of Casters for protection. All right, let's see what kind of nonsense we get up to this time...  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
I'll stay here. Someone's gotta make sure we have a way to stay in touch, after all. All right guys, buon viaggio!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I'll stay here. Someone's gotta make sure we have a way to stay in touch, after all. All right guys, buon viaggio!  
  
**Voyager:**   
...You have a lot of friends, don't you?  
  
**Voyager:**   
She used to, too.  
But now, she's all alone.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who are you talking about?  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
You'll see what I mean...once you meet her yourself...  
  
＄94-04-77-02-1-0  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that...  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...a city?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...a game board?  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is this place?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
...Where are we?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...This is Akihabara.  
A city inside the game.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Akihabara!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This doesn't look like the Akihabara I know...  
  
---  
  
**Edison:**   
Akihabara! A town famous for its technology and culture! Although, I don't recall half of it being underwater before...  
  
**Edison:**   
It's certainly beautiful, but it's also decadent beyond redemption! Even for a game setting, this is just too sad!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Assuming those aren't tears, then it must be the ocean. No, I'm sure of it. A great body of salt water is ebbing its way towards the city.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe the ice caps melted?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Climate change, I guess?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
So the sea level has risen so much that  
Akihabara is now a coastal city...?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Looks like this place managed to hold on just one step shy of full-blown collapse. Cop-outs.  
  
**Voyager:**   
That's mean!  
This is a very special city.  
  
**Voyager:**   
A big war took place here.  
The last war that ever revolved around a Holy Grail.  
  
**Mash:**   
The last Holy Grail War?  
  
**Voyager:**   
It happened a little after you.  
I'm sure you're all okay.  
  
**Voyager:**   
That war changed a lot of things.  
It's what made the city like this.  
  
**Voyager:**   
This place is important to me.  
I'm sure it is to her, too.  
  
**Voyager:**   
So I'm sure this is where we'll find her.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Still don't know who you're talking about.  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
My best friend.  
She...got lost, and now she's all alone.  
  
**Voyager:**   
There aren't many people like that in this city.  
Because, here&ndash;  
  
**Helena:**   
Oh, hey! I didn't know you guys were here too!  
Welcome to Akihabara and its Monde du Jeu!  
  
**Mash:**   
Helena!  
Um... What's “Monde du Jeu”?  
  
**Helena:**   
It's the world of play inside this board game.  
  
**Helena:**   
You guys saw the pieces that make up the mysterious game set too, right? Those are miniatures of the Monde du Jeu.  
  
**Helena:**   
There are five cities altogether, each with their own game. Akihabara here is one of them.  
  
**Mash:**   
I see. That does shed a lot of light on what's going on, but...I'm still wondering who your, um, gingerbread friend is?  
  
**???:**  
Hey! Who're you calling gingerbread!?  
  
**Helena:**   
Oh gosh, I'm so sorry, Master. These people still  
have a lot to learn about the ways of this world.  
  
**Mash:**   
Huh? Did you just call that, um, figure “Master”?  
  
**Helena:**   
I sure did. This lovely lady here is my Master here in Akihabara. Though of course, I didn't find that out until after I got here, either.  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
Don't be ridiculous, Helena!  
You and I have always been destined to be partners!  
  
**Helena:**   
Were we? Yeah, you must be right. This IS my  
Akihabara self we're talking about, after all.  
  
**Mash:**   
What's going on, Senpai?  
Both Helena and this world seem a little...off.  
  
**Voyager:**   
They're not just a little off.  
They're way off.  
  
**Voyager:**   
People didn't look like this in the Akihabara I know.  
  
**Mash:**   
I see. So this is strange to you, too...  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
That Master looks just like the Meeple pieces  
in one of my favorite board games.  
  
**Edison:**   
So even humans become a literal part of the game here! As scandalous as that is, I can't help but admire the sheer scale of this standardization!  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
Hey! Quit staring at me!  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh! I'm sorry.  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
What's going on here, Helena? Are these people Servants? They're not Rogue Servants, are they?  
  
**Helena:**   
By all means, I'd be happy to explain, my temporary Master. These people are Servants of Chaldea.  
  
**Helena:**   
That [♂ boy /♀️ girl] there is the only Master among them.  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
What? You mean [♂ he's /♀️ she's] a single  
Master with multiple Servants?  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
But that's impossible!  
  
**Helena:**   
It's perfectly normal in Chaldea.  
  
**Helena:**   
You know how in this city, everyone has a Holy Grail within them, as well as a contract with a Servant?  
  
**Helena:**   
Well, in Chaldea, there are only a few  
Holy Grails in the entire world.  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
Unbelievable! Those poor people! How in the world  
do they get by without their own Holy Grail!?  
  
**Edison:**   
Well now, what a fascinating setting! So in this world, everyone and their mother has a contract with a Heroic Spirit!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I've never heard of anything like it!  
It sounds simply wonderful.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Sounds downright terrifying.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
What happens when someone draws a Servant  
who's only good for killing, like me?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
I'll tell you. Any hope an average Jane had of dying a peaceful death goes right down the drain.  
  
**Voyager:**   
What makes you think that?  
Aren't you a good person?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
...Person? No. Weapon? Yeah.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Which means I'm also a halfway decent Servant.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Like I said, the only thing I'm good for is killing.  
It's the whole reason I'm here.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
And as long as I, and everyone else around me,  
knows what I am, there's no problem. Period.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Simple, right?  
Now don't ask me any more pointless questions.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I couldn't help it.  
You kind of remind me of...someone I know...  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
...  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
On a different subject: What is it that brings you here, “Master” of Chaldea?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm here to save everyone who went missing.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm here to bring the Servants back home.  
  
---  
  
**Helena:**   
You mean, like me?  
  
**Edison:**   
It's not just you, Blavatsky. A great number of Servants have disappeared under mysterious circumstances.  
  
**Edison:**   
They must have all been trapped in this game world!  
We need to bring them home at once!  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
Oh my, goodness me!  
So you want to kidnap my precious Helena?  
  
**Helena:**   
Don't worry, Master of Akihabara.  
I love my new life here.  
  
**Edison:**   
What are you saying, Helena!?  
You don't seriously mean to stay here, do you!?  
  
**Edison:**   
Don't you remember your friends at Chaldea!? There's me, the half-witted eccentric, that Sigerson bastard&ndash;  
  
**Helena:**   
You guys don't get it, do you? Did you really think you could just leave whenever you wanted?  
  
**Mash:**   
Huh? What do you mean?  
  
**Helena:**   
The moment you jumped into the Monde du Jeu,  
you all became a part of this world's mechanics.  
  
**Helena:**   
So you need to play the game if you want to  
leave Akihabara and go somewhere else.  
  
**Mash:**   
So, we have to play this game...and win...  
  
**Helena:**   
Winning will earn you tokens, like this one.  
  
**Helena:**   
Once you have enough tokens, you'll be able to acquire the qualifications you need to leave this city.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
What happens if we should lose the game?  
  
**Helena:**   
Oh, you'll find out soon enough♪  
  
**Helena:**   
Hm? Why Fujimaru, I didn't know you already had  
your own piece. Even if it isn't a Meeple.  
  
**Helena:**   
I'm glad to see you're so excited about this! Does this mean you're going to try your hand at the game?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What other choice do I have?  
  
---  
  
**Helena:**   
Then let me give you this token  
as a little parting gift.  
  
**Helena:**   
All right, it's time for our first game: Culdpoly!  
  
**Helena:**   
The rules are simple. Roll the dice to determine the number of spaces to move, and something will happen on whichever property your piece ends up on.  
  
**Helena:**   
The goal is to claim the whole  
city of Akihabara for yourself!  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh, I know this one! This is a famous board game where players compete to own property and grow their companies!  
  
**Mash:**   
Can I play too, Senpai!? I've always wanted to try it!  
  
**Voyager:**   
Let me roll the dice.  
I'm really good at it.  
  
**Helena:**   
So you're all going to team up, huh? Fine with me. Just make sure your team stays the same until the game is over.  
  
**Helena:**   
The rest of you don't have Meeples, right?  
Then you'll just have to spectate this time.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Fine with me. I'm a little tired, anyway.  
I wonder if it's too soon for afternoon tea?  
  
**Edison:**   
Very well then, we'll stay and relax in the salon  
by the starting point. Good luck, Fujimaru!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Take it from me, you don't want to let these kinds of games drag on for too long. Make sure you get back while I've still got my wits about me.  
  
**Helena:**   
Okay, let's get started, shall we♪

**Mash:**   
It looks like an antique shop.  
Maybe they'll have something rare or interesting.  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
Heeelp!  
Skeletooon!  
  
**Mash:**   
There's a monster here!?  
  
**Mash:**   
...Huh? Hassan of the Cursed Arm?  
  
**Cursed Arm:**   
Who, me? No, no. I'm just an average shopkeeper sweeping my storeroom.  
  
**Cursed Arm:**   
Though as a matter of fact, I was just dealing with a model skeleton that suddenly went berserk for no discernible reason.  
  
**Cursed Arm:**   
I was just chasing it outside,  
so it wouldn't damage the merchandise.  
  
**Mash:**   
Now the model skeleton is headed our way!  
Awaiting your orders, Senpai!  
  
＄94-04-77-07-1-1  
  
**Mash:**   
There! The battle is over!  
  
**Cursed Arm:**   
Well done. I must say, I'm impressed. You must have a lot of experience with this sort of thing.  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
Hey, this concerned you too, you know!  
Why didn't you do anything to help!?  
  
**Cursed Arm:**   
I couldn't, Master. I had to stay here in order to perform my duties: protecting the merchandise, even at the cost of my own life.  
  
**Cursed Arm:**   
And as you can see, it worked.  
They have not so much as a single scratch on them.  
  
**Cursed Arm:**   
Thank you so much, all of you.  
Please, take this as a token of my gratitude.  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
Hey! Who said you could give  
out my merch for nothing!?  
  
＄94-04-77-08-1-0

Monsters are ransacking the antique shop!  
We'd better chase them away, Senpai!

Welcome to the shooting gallery.  
Aim carefully now!

**Kid Gil:**   
Congratulations!  
Here's your prize.  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
H-hey! That's my precious collection!  
  
**Kid Gil:**   
I know. But I'm all you really need, aren't I, Master?  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
Hehehe, oh you.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Are they...friends?  
  
**Mash:**   
I think so...

**Fujimaru 1:**   
L-let's just say they are and leave it at that.

Welcome to Pharaoh Cosmetics.  
What kind of makeup are you looking for today?  
  
**Mash:**   
Me? Oh, I don't need any...  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
Then here, [♂ sir /♀️ miss], why don't you come with me and take  
a look at our collection? Come on, right this way.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh!? Me?  
  
**Mash:**   
U-um, if I may!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Save me, Mash!  
  
**Mash:**   
Right!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai doesn't need any makeup!  
[♂ He's /♀️ She's] already perfect as [♂ he /♀️ she] is!  
  
**Mash:**   
Although...that being said...  
  
**Mash:**   
I can't deny that I'm, um, curious to see  
what Senpai would look like in makeup...  
  
**Voyager:**   
I want to see that, too. Very much.  
  
**Nitocris:**   
Very well then.  
Please, take a look in this mirror.  
  
**Nitocris:**   
It may show you your vanity, your aesthetic sense,  
or perhaps something else entirely...  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
Well? What do you see?  
Go on, take a long, looong look... (Splash, splash.)  
  
**Mash:**   
Uh, Senpai!?  
There's something crawling out from inside the mirror!  
  
＄94-04-77-11-1-1  
  
**Mash:**   
There! We've driven off the enemies  
that came out of the mirror!  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
Do you...always carry things like  
that around in your heart?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe I'm just more tired than I realized?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think something might be haunting me...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I-I'm sure you don't have anything to worry about, Senpai! I-I mean, this is all just a game, right?  
  
**Nitocris:**   
Only the gods can answer that...but, I CAN offer you a free sample of one of our products!  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
Thank you, and I look forward to serving you again.

Welcome to the Potato Pet Shop!

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Potato?

**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't you mean “Pooch” or something?  
  
---  
  
**Gareth:**   
I named it after my big brother's favorite food.  
He says it's all he eats since becoming a Servant.  
  
**Gareth:**   
Anyway, what kind of pet are you looking for?  
Ours are all as adorable as they are friendly!  
  
**Mash:**   
I see you let them all run around freely, too.  
  
**Mash:**   
...Huh!? Now they're rushing straight at us!?  
  
＄94-04-77-13-1-1  
  
**Mash:**   
The battle is over.  
I'm glad we were able to calm them down.  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
Oh my, just look at these poor things chomping away. They must have been absolutely starving.  
  
**Mash:**   
Something about a pet store treating its  
customers as feed seems...off to me...  
  
**Voyager:**   
I'm never coming here again. Never.  
Pets are supposed to be cute.  
  
**Gareth:**   
I'm so sorry about all that!  
I hope this will help make it up to you...  
  
＄94-04-77-14-1-0

**Voyager:**   
I hear a voice. A really nice voice. It's pretty, and strong.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That voice does sound familiar... Are they performing a play or something?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Now that you mention it...it does seem like a performance. It sounds like it's coming from that hotel. Let's go see.  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
“How much is true love worth?”  
  
**Shakespeare:**   
“To even attempt to name a price  
would be crude beyond compare.”  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
“But I wish to trace your love back to its source, so that I may measure it in all its grandeur.”  
  
**Shakespeare:**   
There we go. I knew it would be worth staying in this hotel night and day to have you help me rehearse, Master.  
  
**Shakespeare:**   
Hm? Who is it?  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh! I'm sorry if we're intruding. The door was wide open, so...  
  
**Voyager:**   
I know about your celestial object.  
It has many others you wrote about in orbit.  
  
**Shakespeare:**   
Well now, you do me a tremendous honor, my little prince!  
  
**Shakespeare:**   
I say, your showing up here is most fortuitous!  
Would you be so kind as to grant me your assistance?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Depends on what we're assisting with.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're asking us to perform in your play, aren't you?  
  
**Shakespeare:**   
A kind offer, but no. Our cup runneth over with performers.  
  
---  
  
**Shakespeare:**   
Worry not, my dear mage. I am well aware that you are incapable of wielding anything heavier than a pen...  
  
**Shakespeare:**   
...which is why I merely request you transcribe what my cohort Master of Akihabara and I are about to perform.  
  
**Shakespeare:**   
All you need do is write down every word we say,  
without missing a proverbial beat.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, that doesn't sound like fun.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That sounds like something Mash would be great at.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Um, don't we still have missing Servants  
we need to find as soon as possible?  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm pretty sure that goes for you too, Shakespeare&ndash;  
  
**Shakespeare:**   
Now, let us begin!  
  
**Shakespeare:**   
“Then you shall end up searching  
for new and distant lands.”  
  
**???:**  
“THEN YOU SHALL END UP SEARCHING  
FOR NEW AND DISTANT LANDS.”  
  
**Mash:**   
Enemies!? They just appeared out of nowhere!  
  
**Shakespeare:**   
Goodness, what a triumph! I never dreamed that my words would pulse with so much magical energy as to quite literally take on a life of their own!  
  
**Shakespeare:**   
I implore you, do not let them get away!  
I wouldst ask that you capture them, for the arts!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you're not even gonna try to help us!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This game world can be a real pain.  
  
---  
  
**Shakespeare:**   
Unfortunately, as the author of these now-embodied words, 'tis my duty to ensure they do not depart before their time.  
  
**Mash:**   
I, um, can't say I get what he's talking about, but okay! Let's do our best to subdue them!

If it were, then the stage'd be full to bursting, and my smiles would be sold out!

**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll have the dragon tail steak, please.

Oh, good choice.  
Tails are pretty much all muscle, after all.  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
Wait, what am I saying!?  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
I'm an idol! I shouldn't be out here hawking meat! Besides, all that sizzling coming from the grill really washes out the sound of my beautiful voice!

What's the big deal? I thought you were used to being muted.

a concert without any sound!?

really like steak, because I'm about to cook you like one!

Y-you know, that was a pretty good jam session.  
All right, I guess I can let you off the hook for now.

...And, I guess I was being a little out of line, so here,  
you can take this with you if you want.

I'll tell you what the problem is. Cat here's supposed to be doing the cooking, but instead, she's been “tasting” enough food for a party of eight.  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I never did anything of the sort. I might follow my instincts wherever they take me, but I don't let them think for me.  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Besides, I don't need that many calories to get by. I'm a napper, not an eater.  
  
**Voyager:**   
There's another cat looking in from the back entrance. A really...really big cat...  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
See? That's the real culprit, woof!  
Watch out! It's even stronger than it looks!  
  
**Mash:**   
Let's catch it!  
  
＄94-04-77-20-1-1  
  
**Mash:**   
It got away...  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
These paw prints perfectly match the ones in the kitchen. That clinches it. No need for a trial here.  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
Oh man... I'm sorry, Cat.  
I guess I really did have you all wrong.  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
That's all I needed to hear, Master. Just let me have one of these carrots, and we'll be even Stephen.  
  
**Tamamo Cat:**   
As for you, [♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.] Marvelous Passerby, I'd like  
you to have this as a show of gratitude, woof!

Heeehahahaha, absurd, isn't it?  
  
**Mephistopheles:**   
But, after so many years spent in a contract-based society, I am supremely confident in my ability to keep and enforce promises no matter what!  
  
**Mephistopheles:**   
So, how about it? Care to sign?

I'm glad you're happy, Mr. Clown.  
Come on, we should keep going.  
  
**Mephistopheles:**   
Hey now, little boy, don't be like that. You wouldn't want to see Mr. Devil here cry, would you?

Would you like to see our collection? Or perhaps you would be willing to become part of it?  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry, did you say “become part of it”?  
  
**Salome:**   
This is a gallery designed solely for sculptures of people, and the collection always gets terribly lonely.

So please give me some new friends.  
I want to grow my collection even more.

All our products are one of a kind.

Is this dragon leather?  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
Our own in-house saint procures our stock herself. She captures them alive and keeps them out back.

She...keeps dragons? You mean, like pets?

They're small dragons, and very well-behaved.  
I trained them all personally.

**Andersen:**   
I'm disappointed in you, Master of Akihabara. Didn't your parents ever teach you not to talk in the library?  
  
**Master of Akihabara:**   
Me!? How am I the noisy one when you've  
got all these books flapping around!?  
  
**Andersen:**   
It's like the wicked banquet of Walpurgis in here. I'll admit it does a good job setting the mood, but it's also noisy as hell.

**Beni-Enma:**   
The person on this token has a perverted fixation with sparrows, but he's still an excellent swordfighter.

Angry animal.  
Coming this way.  
  
**Mash:**   
Awaiting your orders, Senpai.  
Hurry, Voyager, get behind me!

Welcome to the world of Culdpoly!  
  
**Helena:**   
The rules are simple. Roll the dice to determine the number of spaces to move, and something will happen on whichever property your piece ends up on.  
  
**Helena:**   
Good luck nabbing those tokens!

**Voyager:**   
...?  
  
**Mash:**   
Is something wrong, Voyager?  
Why did you stop?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...I found her.  
  
**Mash:**   
Huh?  
  
**Voyager:**   
That's her.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's your lost friend?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's the girl you've been searching for?  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
...What do you guys want?  
If you're here to stop me, I'll end you.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I've been looking for you, Erice.  
  
**Erice:**   
...No way. Voyager? Is that you?  
  
**Erice:**   
What are you doing here? And who are they?  
Why are you with them?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm his partner in this game, so...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think...I'm here because Voyager chose me.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
You're a player of this game, too?  
  
**Erice:**   
And I guess this means you're also, um...Voyager's new M-Master?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I guess so. At least for now.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't think we have an officialcontract in place yet, but probably.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
I see. Then that means we're rivals.  
  
**Erice:**   
Though of course, unlike you,  
I don't have anyone else helping me out.  
  
**Mash:**   
Um, I think Voyager said your name is Erice?  
Is that right?  
  
**Erice:**   
Some people used to call me that.  
Not that any of them are still around.  
  
**Erice:**   
But these days, I think the other  
name I go by might be a better fit.  
  
**Mash:**   
You have another name? What is it?  
  
**Erice:**   
The Grim Reaper.  
  
**Mash:**   
The Grim Reaper?  
  
**Erice:**   
Of course, right now, I'm just playing  
this game here in the Monde du Jeu.  
  
**Erice:**   
I'm sure you're not thrilled with the idea of fighting for your lives, but I really can't stand needless dramatics.  
  
**Erice:**   
So don't worry. I'm going to destroy this entire  
messed-up world, and all of you along with it.  
  
**Erice:**   
Once I've done that, everything should go back to normal!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait! There must be a way we can resolve this peacefully!  
  
**Erice:**   
Don't give me that nonsense!  
Every game needs its winners and losers!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Grim Reaper? Did you say “Grim Reaper”? Really?  
  
**Erice:**   
Sh-shut up! It's just a nickname, okay!?  
It's not like I chose it myself!  
  
---  
  
＄94-04-77-45-1-1  
  
**Erice:**   
Khh...!  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice, please listen to us!  
Voyager's been trying to save you all this&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
So what, you're saying I owe you!?  
After you went and stole him from me!?  
  
**Voyager:**   
You're wrong, Erice.  
  
**Erice:**   
This isn't over. Not by a long shot.  
  
**Erice:**   
I don't know what the deal is with you guys,  
or what's going on in this world...  
  
**Erice:**   
But I'm going to put an end to all of it!  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice!  
  
＄94-04-77-45-2-0  
  
**Edison:**   
I take it you're all okay?  
  
**Mash:**   
Edison. Nursery Rhyme. Alter. You're all here!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
We saw you fighting that girl.  
Who was she? Is she a Servant?  
  
**Voyager:**   
That was Erice. She's lost.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
So that's the friend you've been telling us about, Voyager?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Uh... Yes?  
...I'm not really sure.  
  
**Voyager:**   
But, I do know one thing...  
She wasn't always like that.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Then something must've happened to her. Something that happens so often people hardly notice.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
People decline, they make mistakes, they rot from the inside out. It's common for someone to grow entirely unrecognizable over time.  
  
**Edison:**   
But you still want to save Erice, don't you, Voyager?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Yes. That's why I came here.  
And why I wanted you to come.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Will you save her?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You bet. I can't sit back and do nothingafter seeing her like that, anyway.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Of course. Besides, I think helping her could giveus a lead on how to bring the other Servants home.  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
Thank you, Fujimaru.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I'm happy. It was good that it was you.  
  
**Helena:**   
Congratulations!  
  
**Mash:**   
Eep!  
You startled me...  
  
**Helena:**   
By the way, I know this is short notice,  
but I have some good news.  
  
**Helena:**   
Fujimaru, you now have enough tokens  
to try your hand at the next stage!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Does that mean we beat this game?  
  
---  
  
**Helena:**   
You can always play it again if you like.  
Especially if you ever need more tokens.  
  
**Helena:**   
In the meantime, the tram to the next  
stage will be leaving soon. Good luck!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks for everything, Ms. Helena.  
  
**Helena:**   
Hey, if you have to deal with all this craziness, the least I can do is try to explain it in a way that makes some kind of sense, right?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're really enjoying yourself, aren't you?  
  
**Helena:**   
That obvious, huh?  
  
**Helena:**   
But hey, sometimes, you've just got to relax  
your mind if you want to win the game, right?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Where's the tram she mentioned?  
I don't see one anywhere...  
  
**Voyager:**   
Over here. Follow me.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
You're going to lead us?  
Are you sure you know the way?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Somehow, I can just tell...  
  
**Voyager:**   
...that Erice is up ahead.  
  
**Edison:**   
I, for one, have no doubts that  
Voyager can lead the way.  
  
**Mash:**   
I've never been on a tram before.  
  
**Edison:**   
A tram that crosses the sea of stars, huh. How very poetic. No doubt it's using direct current for its power supply.  
  
**Mash:**   
I, um...suppose it could be...  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
Hey guys! Miss me?  
  
**Mash:**   
Da Vinci!  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
Phew, I finally got our comms link established.  
Glad to see you're all in good shape.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
So, how're things on your end?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We found the girl Voyager's been looking for, but...  
  
---  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
...Gotcha. That does sound pretty weird.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
I take it this Erice is almost certainly a Servant then?  
  
**Mash:**   
Based on the extraordinary combat prowess she demonstrated, I do think that's a likely possibility, but...  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
Something's still nagging at you?  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes. The fact that Erice was all alone.  
  
**Mash:**   
Back in Akihabara, everyone had their own personal Holy Grail, and lived alongside their Servant.  
  
**Mash:**   
But as I said, Erice was acting all on her own.  
Which must mean&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She might be here as a player.  
  
---  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
Gotcha. In that case, we can't discount  
the possibility that Erice, like you...  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
...is actually a human mage.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
Interesting. That would definitely explain why  
she doesn't seem to be like other Servants.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
So Voyager, based on everything we know so far, it seems like a safe bet that you were Erice's contracted Servant.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
What do you know about her?  
Anything you can tell us?  
  
**Voyager:**   
The Erice I know is...human.  
The last one in that city...  
  
**Voyager:**   
That's why I...  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
...It looks like he's confused, too.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey guys! Miss me?  
  
**Mash:**

**Edison:**   
Let's say Voyager here is a Rogue Servant.  
If that's true, then what does that make her?  
  
**Edison:**   
If she's a Heroic Spirit, then what great feat did she accomplish? What's the legend giving her life?  
  
**Edison:**   
Unlike with Voyager, I couldn't even begin to guess what her story might be.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Personally, she seemed like something straightout of Japanese mythology to me.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
All I know for sure is, her outfit and spear bothseemed like they came from ancient Japan.  
  
---  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Agreed. She looked like she had some divine elements about her.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Unfortunately, her magical energy flow's so complex, she was hard to get a good read on. Seemed like a sea-god, water-god, or a god of the underworld.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Making her a High Servant&ndash;an amalgamation of multiple gods all in a single human vessel.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
For example, she could be a single human vessel housing multiple gods...  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Or...she could be a Pseudo-Servant being possessed by gods so minor I can't imagine who they could be.  
  
**Mash:**   
A Pseudo-Servant...!?  
  
**Edison:**   
I'm impressed with your knowledge and how you've applied it, but how can you be so sure of the details?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
I come across a lot of these things in my line of work. Once you know their scent, they're easy to spot.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Besides, isn't it obvious from the way she fought? She was clearly combining elements from multiple myths and legends.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Goes to show that even in a modern, materialistic place like Akihabara, there's still land with ties to mythology.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
Now that you mention it, there IS a shrine smack-dab  
in the middle of Akihabara, isn't there?  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
If I'm not mistaken, it's dedicated to Onamuchi,  
Sukunabikona, and Taira-no-Masakado.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hey, I recognize those names!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe that has something to do with Erice?  
  
---  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
I'll be honest, I'm going purely from the gut here. I don't have a single shred of evidence to back it up. I'm a big believer in flashes of insight though.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
For example, Onamuchi is said to have brought many gods into a single amalgamation, eventually changing his name to Okuninushi.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
If that's true, then he's basically the god-equivalent of a High Servant.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
Legends also say that Onamuchi worked with Sukunabikona to build Japan, only this version of Sukunabikona was actually a wise Lilliputian who came on a ship from far beyond the waves.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
Apparently, in his final moments, he's meant to cross over to a paradise for the dead far across the sea called Tokoyo-no-Kuni.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
However, that's not the only land of the dead in this legend. There's also one called Ne-no-Kuni, which is said to exist underground; it's pretty much a literal hellscape.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
In fact, now that I think of it, Onamuchi got his start at building Japan by enduring hardships in Ne-no-Kuni until he'd become a full-fledged god.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
So thinking about it like that, while Erice almost certainly has some aspects associated with the underworld to her personality...  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
...her actual role might be much closer to a god of creation.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
And if that's true, it would mean her spear is probably&ndash;  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
What, the Amenonuboko?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Ha! Good one. No way in hell it could be that.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
Why not?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
That spear's a fake. It's basically a magecraft  
photocopy, and just as empty on the inside.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, if anyone would know, it's definitely you...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So you think Erice can use projection magecraft?  
**Emiya Alter:**   
That, I can't say.  
  
---  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
If any Servant were to possess something like the original Amenonuboko, it'd have to be a high-ranking Divine Spirit.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
But this Erice girl's Spirit Origin  
isn't anywhere near strong enough.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
I see. You do make a good point.  
  
**Edison:**   
Strong case or not, this is still all just speculation, since we have yet to find anything in the way of hard evidence. So I say our next order of business is to do some serious investigation.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
All right then, I'll leave you guys to it. Let me know as soon as you find something. Ciao for now!

**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Come on, Voyager, say something.  
You must know Erice better than anyone.  
  
**Voyager:**   
No, I don't know much about her at all.  
  
**Voyager:**   
That wasn't the Erice I know.  
  
**Voyager:**   
The Erice I know would never want  
to put an end to everything.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't think Erice is the only thing off here.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There's something off about Akihabara too.About this whole Monde du Jeu, really.  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
Yeah. Everything is off here.  
  
**Voyager:**   
So I have to stop her.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Well, she obviously isn't on this tram,  
so she must have gotten on the one before us.  
  
**Mash:**   
Then we'll have to catch up to her.  
  
**Edison:**   
Oh, don't worry about that. I'm quite sure we'll run into her again in the next city.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I hope you're right...  
  
**Mash:**   
...  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh, look! We're coming up on the tram's destination!  
  
**Edison:**   
So that's the second game world of Monde du Jeu, hmm.  
  
**Mash:**   
This next one seems to be considerably smaller...  
  
**Mash:**   
It looks more like a Western farming village than a city.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hopefully that means it's a nice, laid-back kind of game.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
If you think the sticks are all good-hearted people and an easygoing life, you're in for a rude awakening.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I like tense, exciting games too, but  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Oh yes! Heart-thudding, pulse-pounding,  
breath-stealing... I just love those sorts of things!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...But I do have to wonder,  
who is this game going to be for?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Will we be pieces wandering around town?  
Or pawns on a battlefield?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I do hope it's the former. I don't want to spill  
anyone's guts, or have my own spilled.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Either way, at this point, all we know for sure  
is that we know nothing about this world.  
  
**Mash:**   
There's no telling what could be lying in wait once we arrive, so we'd better be prepared for anything.  
  
**Voyager:**   
That sounds scary. Your journey must have been...hard.  
  
**Voyager:**   
But it can't be too bad.  
There must be some really good things, too...

I now ask those of you invited to the second game:  
  
**Jeanne:**   
                            Are you werewolves?  
  
**:**  
#### !?  
  
**:**  
#### !?  
  
**:**  
#### !?  
  
**:**  
#### !?  
  
**:**  
#### !?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...Erice isn't here.  
  
**Mash:**   
Not even a trace.  
It doesn't look like she's in this building.  
  
**Mash:**   
It's very unfortunate, but right now, we need to  
get a handle on this, um...werewolf situation?  
  
**Edison:**   
As I'd think would be plain to see,  
I'm a lion, not a wolf.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
I could be a wolf if you want. I erased the word "impossible" from my dictionary long ago, after all.  
  
**Marie:**   
Werewolves? What's this all about?  
I'm afraid I just don't understand.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
No need to overthink it, Maria. This is a festival, right? It's no different from wearing a costume, I'm sure.  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh, I see! Now that you mention it, you look  
just like a werewolf yourself, Amadeus!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Right? Not bad, huh?  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh yes, it suits you wonderfully!  
  
**d'Eon:**   
I must say, Your Highness, that colorful outfit suits you wonderfully as well.  
  
**Marie:**   
Thank you, d'Eon. Since we're playing a game today,  
I thought I would try a more mischievous look.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
And I'm letting my danger flag fly high and proud!  
  
**Salieri:**   
So now you're not even bothering to hide your bestial nature beneath your usual vulgarity? Ugh, you disgust me. If I was a hunter, I'd be taking aim at your head as we speak.  
  
**Sanson:**   
I understand how you feel, but please try to control yourself. Executions should only be handled by trained professionals.  
  
**Phantom:**   
Indeed. Everyone has a role to play. Commoners are mere extras; the spotlight should be reserved for those with God-given talent.  
  
**Phantom:**   
Yes, the time for discussion has ended.  
Now sing, my little lost lambs. Sing.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I love to sing. What would you like to hear?  
A Song of Sixpence? Lizzie Borden?  
  
**d'Eon:**   
That's enough! All of you, be quiet! We'll never get anywhere if you all keep speaking out of turn!  
  
**Charlotte Corday:**   
Um, I'm sorry if this is silly of me, but I'm afraid I still don't understand how this game works...  
  
**Gilles:**   
As far as I can tell, it appears to be a philosophical game designed to represent the dual nature of humanity.  
  
**Charlotte Corday:**   
Um... Hehe, I still don't get it. Do you think you could dumb that down a little for me?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
He means that some of us have to play werewolves.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Isn't that right?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Yes, it is.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
This is a survival game, where every player invited to the mansion tries to be among the last ones standing.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Most of the players are assigned the role of good-hearted villagers...  
  
**Jeanne:**   
...but a small handful have to play as dangerous killers&ndash;werewolves, in this game's case.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Nobody can know which role other players  
have except for fellow werewolves.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Every night, the werewolves choose one person to kill...  
  
**Jeanne:**   
...while all the villagers can do is meet during the day to choose someone suspicious for execution.  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh my!  
  
**Charlotte Corday:**   
What a terrifying game!  
  
**Gilles:**   
Goodness. Seems this particular form of entertainment is a little much for fair maidens to handle.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
For my part, I just think it  
is in incredibly poor taste.  
  
**Sanson:**   
...May I ask what manner of execution we use?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
In this game, chosen suspects have to be hanged.  
No guillotines.  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh, thank goodness. I would hate to be reminded  
of that ghastly instrument of death.  
  
**Sanson:**   
...  
...I have to disagree.  
  
**Sanson:**   
Hanging is an incredibly painful and inhumane method of execution. Just because one is being executed, doesn't mean they deserve undue suffering.  
  
**Phantom:**   
Absolutely. Rope is such an ugly way. It's an affront to beauty itself. It strangles the soon-to-be deceased's singing voice before it robs them of their life.  
  
**Edison:**   
If you think that's bad, gentlemen, you should see the awful electric chairs they use nowadays. They're the hot new thing in the execution world, and of course they make use of detestable alternating current!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's enough execution talk for now, thanks.Getting back to the werewolves...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okay, no more execution discussion.What else can you tell us about the werewolves?  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Getting back on topic...  
As I said, the goal of this game is to survive.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
If you're a villager,  
that means you need to kill all the werewolves.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
And if you're a werewolf,  
you need to deceive the villagers into thinking you're not.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
If the last werewolf falls, the villagers win.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
If enough villagers die that the survivors number the same as the werewolves, the werewolves win.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
As the Rul&ndash;er, overseer, I promise to watch  
over the proceedings fairly and impartially.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Any questions?  
  
**Mash:**   
Um, Senpai, Voyager, and I have all  
been on the same team so far, so&ndash;  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Not a problem.  
I'll make an exception for the three of you.  
  
**Salieri:**   
Just like that, without seeking consent from the other players? Game or not, how can that be fair?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Face it, Salieri, some people are just born luckier than others.  
  
**Salieri:**   
And just what is that supposed to mean, Amadeus!?  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Stop that! There will be no fighting!  
  
**Gilles:**   
We are here to enjoy the game, nothing more.  
Do not ruin our fun by bringing in personal vendettas.  
  
**Salieri:**   
In that case, Fujimaru, I will warn you now:  
be very afraid. As exceptions to the rules, you will be shunned by villagers and werewolves alike.  
  
**Salieri:**   
Though fortunately for you, I'll be sending you to the gallows well before that becomes a problem.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Does that mean you'll be gunning for me rather than Amadeus?  
  
---  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Wow, Fujimaru, this is downright miraculous!  
You should be honored!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
I didn't think it was even possible for  
Salieri to hate somebody more than me!  
  
**Mash:**   
D-do you think so?  
(Salieri doesn't seem to hate Senpai as mu&ndash;)  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Since Servants are all leaving their Masters' sides to participate as lone Heroic Spirits for this game...  
  
**Jeanne:**   
...I think just letting Fujimaru take part  
as a Master means it is more than fair to make an exception for [♂ him /♀️ her].  
  
**Sanson:**   
Then I take it that means [♂ he /♀️ she] and [♂ his /♀️ her] team can be  
considered a single target for the purposes of execution?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Of course.  
  
**Mash:**   
...!?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh... We are still talking about a game here, right?  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne:**   
We are. But here in this mansion,  
the game's rules make up the entire world.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
So I urge you to do everything you can  
to survive until the end.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
---  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Sounds pretty serious for a game.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
I don't know if these people always had a screw loose, or if coming here made that happen.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
But, I guess it doesn't matter. Things are still going to be chaotic as hell around here either way.  
  
**Mash:**   
Um, I would just as soon avoid the chaos if we can...  
  
**Marie:**   
Don't worry, Mash. This is all just a game, right?  
So let's just enjoy it! Don't overthink things.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Does that mean you'll let us join the game, too?  
  
**Marie:**   
Of course! The more the merrier, after all.  
Especially when it comes to fun occasions like this!  
  
**Edison:**   
I'll be taking part too, of course. Every game can use a symbol of coolheaded intelligence, after all.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Let's have some fun, mon frère!  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh gosh, I'm starting to get really nervous...  
  
**Jeanne:**   
All right, now that we have all our players  
for the second game, let's get started.  
  
**:**  
                                  – Day One –  
  
**Jeanne:**   
This second game is called  
“Werewolves in the Haunted House.”  
  
**Jeanne:**   
First, I'll tell all twelve players, and our special group of three, their respective roles.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Check the cards you've been dealt,  
but make sure no one else sees them!  
  
**Napoleon:**   
...  
  
**Marie:**   
...  
  
**Amadeus:**   
...  
  
**Salieri:**   
...  
  
**Sanson:**   
...  
  
**Phantom:**   
Ahh... My beloved angel...  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Shh. Quiet.  
  
**Gilles:**   
...  
  
**Charlotte Corday:**   
...Oh my.  
  
**Edison:**   
Well now.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
What!? You've got to be joking!  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Quiet, please.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
But&ndash;  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Don't worry about it. It's just a game.  
No point getting worked up about it.  
  
**Mash:**   
What card did you draw, Senpai?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Seer.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Huh?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Oh yes, I almost forgot.  
This game also has a number of specialized roles.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
The Seer belongs to the villagers' side. Every night, they can divine the identity of one other player.  
  
**Mash:**   
...(Gulp)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...(That sounds like a huge freaking deal!)  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne:**   
The Knight, who also belongs to the villagers' side, can protect one other player from a werewolf attack, but only once per night.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
The Fanatic is a traitor to the villagers. They work in secret to aid the werewolves and bring about the villagers' ruin.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
The Fanatic knows who the werewolves are, but the werewolves do not know who the Fanatic is.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
The Lovers are a special role that two players  
hold in addition to their other roles.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
They may or may not be on opposing sides,  
but they can always tell who their partner is.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
The Lovers win if both survive to the end. However, if one should happen to die, the other must follow suit.  
  
**Phantom:**   
What about my angel?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Huh?  
  
**Phantom:**   
If there are Lovers in this game,  
then my angel ought to be here as well!  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Get it together, Phantom!  
Jeanne's only talking about the game roles.  
  
**Phantom:**   
...Are you my angel?  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Huh!?  
  
**Phantom:**   
Sing...  
Sing, my angel, sing!  
  
**Napoleon:**   
You wanna hear a song?  
Then get a load of this!  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Myyy naaame iiis Napoleooon♪  
III maaake theee impossible happeeen♪  
  
**Phantom:**   
#### Gaaah!  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Impressed?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
More like impaled!  
  
**Salieri:**   
What a fortissimo! And one that epitomizes self-love and delusions of grandeur, no less!  
  
**Napoleon:**   
What're you talking about? This is a sonata of my own composition! The great Paganini wrote and performed it for me himself.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Granted, I did just come up with the  
lyrics on the spur of the moment.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Ahem! If you're all finished, I'd like to tell  
you how the game is actually played now.  
  
**Gilles:**   
All of you! The Maiden of Orleans is about to grace  
us with a proclamation, so settle down and listen up!  
  
**Phantom:**   
Gaaah!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Ooh, good one!  
That hit him right where it hurts!  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Every good commander needs a booming voice. Especially when amassing a large number of troops all at once.  
  
**Salieri:**   
Ugh, I'm surrounded by barbarians! Maybe I should hang you all on the gallows while I'm at it!  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Not without following the hanging rules, you won't!  
  
**Sanson:**   
Based on what you told us earlier, I'm assuming we all decide who to hang through a vote?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Right you are.  
  
**Charlotte Corday:**   
So...does that mean we all have to discuss who to vote on? Can we really arrive at a decision that way?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
We have to, whether we like it or not.  
It's the only way to eliminate risks.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
'Cause if we just stand around twiddling our thumbs, the werewolves will have their pick of the villagers.  
  
**Edison:**   
Hmm! So it's essentially a private courthouse.  
Only a half step removed from a lynch mob, really!  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh, let's not spoil our fun by overthinking. Let's just enjoy the game with all the thrills it has to offer.  
  
**Sanson:**   
...Good point, Marie. As you say, this is a game&ndash;  
one we all have the right to enjoy.  
  
**Sanson:**   
I still don't like the hanging part, though. Not after all the hangings I botched back when I was sixteen or seventeen...  
  
**Marie:**   
So hey, the game's already begun, right?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Yes, it has.  
  
**Marie:**   
Then...does that mean we have to hang someone?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Not on the first day. For now, I suggest you all talk to one another and gather as much information as you can.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
The more players' identities you can figure out,  
the better your odds of survival will be.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
And as a quick reminder, on top of the villages, your numbers include a Seer, a Knight, and two Lovers.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
And don't forget, there is also a Fanatic and two werewolves among you.  
  
**:**  
#### ...!  
  
**:**  
#### ...!  
  
**:**  
#### ...!  
  
**:**  
#### ...!  
  
**:**  
#### ...!  
  
**Mash:**   
Two werewolves...  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I know who one of them is. It's me.  
  
**Mash:**   
Huh!?  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Ooh là là! This is quite the twist right out of the gate! Do you mean it, little mademoiselle?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Yes, I do. I don't want to be a big bad wolf. They're the enemy of children in stories everywhere!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
So please, hurry up and hang me so I can  
leave this game as soon as possible.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
What a noble child!  
  
**Charlotte Corday:**   
I know... She almost seems divine. I guess it just goes to show that even werewolves can be honorable!  
  
**Phantom:**   
No... This cannot be the truth! I refuse to accept it!  
  
**Phantom:**   
Please, my little fairy-tale angel, don't go.  
I just can't let an angel go!  
  
**Sanson:**   
Hold on. How do we know Ms. Nursery Rhyme  
here is even telling the truth?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I would never tell a lie! I hate lies!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can I just ask you something?  
  
---  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Of course, Fujimaru. Anything.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do you know who the other werewolf is?  
  
---  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Of course.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
But I won't tell you who it is.  
It would spoil the game.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Well said! I, for one, don't have any problem  
trusting you, little mademoiselle.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Teehee, why thank you.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Still, I can say there's one other player besides me who knows the second werewolf's identity. Someone who would be very put out if their identity came to light...  
  
**Edison:**   
That's a riddle if ever I've heard one!  
  
**Mash:**   
Are you talking about the Fanatic?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I can't tell you. That's a secret.  
  
**Charlotte Corday:**   
Well, I'm not worried! I'm sure this person will find your actions just as inspiring as I have!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Do you really think so?  
  
**Charlotte Corday:**   
I do! Personally, I'm willing to follow you to the ends of the earth!  
  
**Phantom:**   
Absolutely. You are both honorable and beautiful, and I too will follow you to the ends of the earth.  
  
**Phantom:**   
Now sing, my angel! Sing for me!  
  
**Sanson:**   
They're not very good listeners, are they...  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Sure, I'd be glad to sing for you.  
How about “The Man with the Twisted Lip”?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
The man with the twisted lip♪  
Cuts across the twisted path♪  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
He spends all his twisted days♪  
Coming up with twisted ways♪  
  
**Phantom:**   
Oh my... That was wonderful!  
I just got chills down my spine!  
  
**Voyager:**   
Talk...going nowhere, huh?  
  
**Mash:**   
Yeah...  
  
**Edison:**   
I must say, genius though I am,  
even I am getting confused...  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Hmm, in that case, why don't I take up the conductor's  
baton for a bit? "The Queen of the Night Aria"  
seems like it would match the mood perfectly.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Oh, I know that one!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Of course you do. My compositions are some of the greatest masterpieces humanity has ever produced.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
But never mind that now. Everyone, your attention please. I have a proposal.  
  
**Salieri:**   
Forget it!  
I'll never consider any idea that comes from you!  
  
**Marie:**   
Well, speaking for myself, I'd love to hear your idea.  
  
**Gilles:**   
As would I. It's not every day one gets to see THE Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart conduct in person.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Why thank you, Gilles.  
Maria, have I ever told you how much I love you?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
As for you, Antonio, perhaps we could just try and calm down? Maybe a few deep breaths will help.  
  
**Salieri:**   
Don't call me by my first name!  
It makes me sick! And stop wasting our time!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
You're right! That's a great point, Antonio!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
As I'm sure you've all noticed by now, it's impossible to have a serious discussion with all of us here.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
We keep wasting time on chitchat, digressions, gossip, bragging, and songs! Not to mention that some people I could name are terrible listeners!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
If we don't do something about this mess, the remaining werewolf will pick off all the villagers before we can even settle on a single suspect!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
So we need a rule. A rule that will help us advance the game and use our time well rather than wasting it.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Okay, what'd you have in mind?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
It's simple. We limit how much we can speak  
to ten minutes per day per player.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Each player can also only ask one question per day, and that question counts as part of their speaking time. This alone ought to make a big difference.  
  
**Salieri:**   
...Hmm. The logic is sound.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Huh, that shut you up.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Guess you're not just automatically against  
anything Amadeus has to say after all.  
  
**Edison:**   
True, we do need some rules on speech.  
Amadeus's proposal makes a lot of sense.  
  
**Sanson:**   
But don't you think this is a little too strict?  
  
**d'Eon:**   
I have to agree. Restricting our ability to converse will only make it easier for the werewolf's identity to remain hidden.  
  
**Marie:**   
You think? If anything, it seems like it would give them fewer opportunities to pull the wool&ndash;um, fur, over our eyes.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
How could you say that, Maria!?  
You make it sound like I'm some kind of con artist!  
  
**Salieri:**   
(...Make it...sound like?)  
  
**Marie:**   
Teehee. I know he's frequently misunderstood, but Amadeus never says anything that isn't helpful.  
  
**Marie:**   
It just sounds like he's always joking around  
because he loves to tease people.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
If you say so, my queen.  
  
**Gilles:**   
What about you, Jeanne? What do you think?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Don't ask me. My only role in this game  
is as its fair and impartial Ruler.  
  
**Gilles:**   
Ah, of course. Please, forgive&ndash;  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Don't back down.  
We're talking about the rules of this game.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
In the first place, do this world's systems even  
let players make their own decisions about them?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
That's up to all of you.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
So we CAN change the rules as long as we want to?  
Is that what you're saying?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
That's the last you'll hear from me on the subject.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
All right, let's put it to a vote!  
We'll settle this democratically!  
  
**Napoleon:**   
All those in favor of Amadeus's proposal,  
line up on my right. All opposed, on my left.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Go!  
  
**Mash:**   
Since we're a three-person group acting as a single player, we probably shouldn't try to vote separately.  
  
**Mash:**   
We'll go along with whatever you decide, Senpai.  
What's your vote?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
In favor.  
  
**Mash:**   
In favor, huh? Understood!  
  
**:**  
                                   – In Favor –  
  
**:**  
                                  – Opposed –  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Those in favor have it.  
We'll officially adopt Amadeus's proposed rule.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Opposed.  
  
**Mash:**   
Opposed, huh? Got it!  
  
**:**  
                                  – Opposed –  
  
**:**  
                                   – In Favor –  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Looks like we're tied six to six.  
  
**Marie:**   
Since Fujimaru's three-person group is a single  
player, they only get one vote between them, right?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Even so, we still have more people on our side.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
I'm afraid you don't, little mademoiselle.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
I'm siding with those in favor, too.  
  
---  
  
**Salieri:**   
This is ridiculous! I refuse to go along with it!  
  
**Edison:**   
Is that your way of saying you wish  
to begin your remarks for the day?  
  
**Salieri:**   
...!  
  
**Napoleon:**   
You can keep going if you want.  
Just keep it to under ten minutes.  
  
**Salieri:**   
(Accursed fools. I can't believe they all fell for Gottlieb's nonsense...)  
  
**:**  
Antonio Salieri: Day One Remarks  
  
**Salieri:**   
...At first, I thought Fujimaru should be  
banished from these premises, given [♂ his /♀️ her]  
heretica&ndash;That is, exceptional circumstances.  
  
**Salieri:**   
But now I see it is you who pose the greatest threat to these proceedings, Mozart! Mark my words, I WILL see you hanged before you invite even greater disaster upon our heads!  
  
**:**  
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Day One Remarks  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Yikes, how frightening. You really mean business, don't you, Antonio? But try to remember, this is all just a game!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Anyway, as a matter of fact,  
I still have something else I'd like to say.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Remember the different roles Jeanne told us about?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Specifically, the Seer?  
  
**Mash:**   
!?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Well, it's me. I'm the Seer. (Sigh) I swear, being blessed with such prodigious talent can be SUCH a burden.  
  
**Mash:**   
That's not true!  
The real Seer is Master Fujimaru!  
  
**Mash:**   
Ah... I just gave away our identity, didn't I?  
I-I'm so sorry, Senpai.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's okay. I was planning on revealing it anyway.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's fine. This should make it easier for the other villagers.  
  
---  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Well, this is a surprise. I wasn't expecting anyone to take issue with it so soon.  
  
**Mash:**   
Why would you lie about this?  
Does this mean you're the other werewol&ndash;  
  
**Amadeus:**   
I know, I look so suspicious right now, right!?  
And this unfortunate outfit choice can't be helping!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
But come on, think about it. Why would I try so hard to stand out when I already look so suspicious?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
If I wanted to survive, the smart thing to do would  
be to NOT draw attention to myself, right?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Well, the reason I'm standing out is because  
I have an obligation to fulfill my Seer duties!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Especially with a certain little girl's werewolf reveal throwing a wrench into the works right from the get-go.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Are you talking about me?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
But of course, my idealistic Märchen maiden! While I would love to take you at your innocent word...  
  
**Amadeus:**   
...I still need to make sure your story checks out, since children are so prone to lying.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
So I told you all I was the Seer, in the hopes of finding out the truth behind your confession.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
But now that we have another supposed Seer trying to pin me as a liar, I don't know what I'm going to do!  
  
**Mash:**   
...(Why is he saying all this? Could there be some greater meaning behind these remarks?)  
  
**Amadeus:**   
All right then, Fujimaru,  
I have a challenge for you.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
If you really are the Seer, then you won't mind divining Ms. Nursery Rhyme's identity, right?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
I'll do the same, of course.  
And when we're done, we can compare the results.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
If one of our answers turns out not to match,  
then we'll know for sure which one of us is lying.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're on.  
  
---  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Ooh, you've got guts!  
This is going to be fun!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Oh, and one more thing, Mash. Can I assume your last  
statement marks the end of your remark time?  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh. Um...I guess it does.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Oh, but don't worry. I'm willing to let you say one  
more thing if you want. I'm generous like that!  
  
**Salieri:**   
Stop smirking! You're acting as though you made all the rules yourself!  
  
**Mash:**   
So...I can still say one more thing if I want to then? Okay, understood.  
  
**:**  
Nursery Rhyme: Day One Remarks  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I'd never tell a lie! If you want to divine my identity, go right ahead!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...Although, I am curious as to how you actually conduct your divinations. If you're going to do them tonight, make sure you wake me up for them, okay?  
  
**:**  
Charlotte Corday: Day One Remarks  
  
**Charlotte Corday:**   
I... I just have so many feelings,  
I'm not even sure where to begin...  
  
**Charlotte Corday:**   
Oh wow. This might be the most fulfilled I've ever felt...ever!  
  
**:**  
Phantom of the Opera: Day One Remarks  
  
**Phantom:**   
...That was a pretty good monologue. I haven't heard such moving poetic sentiment in some time...  
  
**:**  
Thomas Edison: Day One Remarks  
  
**Edison:**   
Putting the game aside for the moment, allow me to offer my professional opinion on a different matter:  
  
**Edison:**   
This mansion's lighting is atrocious! It needs to be outfitted with proper wiring! By which I of course mean direct current!  
  
**Edison:**   
Just say the word, and I'll have this place wired up in no time flat, and it'll be very affordabl&ndash;  
  
**:**  
(The rest of his ten minutes were spent  
explaining technical minutiae.)  
  
**:**  
Charles-Henri Sanson: Day One Remarks  
  
**Sanson:**   
At the risk of repeating myself yet again, I cannot endorse hanging. It's not too late to reconsider.  
  
**Sanson:**   
...I wonder if there's a place on this mansion's property where I could put together a guillotine.  
  
**Sanson:**   
Of course, it would only be a nonfunctional replica, but regardless, I need to do what I can to uphold my duties as an executioner.  
  
**Sanson:**   
Everyone deserves a peaceful death, regardless of what sort of person they are. Don't worry, Marie. I won't let the werewolves sink their filthy fangs into you!  
  
**:**  
Marie Antoinette: Day One Remarks  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh my, having everyone hanging on what  
I say like this is a little nerve-wracking.  
  
**Marie:**   
Especially given the earlier misunderstanding I caused...  
  
**Marie:**   
Then again, I guess I don't have to worry about that, since this is a private session today. I hope you'll all forgive me if I mess up somehow.  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh, right.  
I need to talk about the werewolves, don't I?  
  
**Marie:**   
I'm sorry! It still hasn't really sunk in yet. I can't tell if I'm feeling frightened or thrilled.  
  
**Marie:**   
I still feel like this is all fun and games right now, but I guess I might feel differently tomorrow...  
  
**Marie:**   
...since somebody here will be gone by then...  
  
**Marie:**   
Ooh, I love you all so much!  
  
**:**  
Chevalier d'Eon: Day One Remarks  
  
**d'Eon:**   
As a knight who has sworn fealty to the French royal family, I will do whatever the Queen wishes.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
...That is all.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
...I mean it. I have nothing more to say!  
Stop laughing, Amadeus!  
  
**:**  
Gilles de Rais: Day One Remarks  
  
**Gilles:**   
Though Her Majesty and I may come from different time periods, as a soldier of France, I am certainly willing to pay her the respect she deserves.  
  
**Gilles:**   
And of course, the Maiden of Orleans herself ordered me to enjoy this game.  
  
**Gilles:**   
So enjoy it I must, come hell or high water. And while I am making my best effort to do just that...  
  
**Gilles:**   
If I am being honest, I must also say that I still find this all very confusing.  
  
**Gilles:**   
If one of these werewolves were to attack me now, I would cut it down on the spot and that would be the end of&ndash;  
  
**Gilles:**   
Oh, right. We need to hang them, don't we?  
  
**Gilles:**   
...Truth be told, I'm relieved we're using the gallows. I'm not sure I could control myself if we were to burn them at the stake.  
  
**Gilles:**   
Hm? Oh, right, this is only a game, isn't it?  
A bit of fancy for fun...  
  
**:**  
Emiya Alter: Day One Remarks  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
I'll give you one piece of advice.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
The fact that we've got two people claiming to be Seers means that one of them's got to be a fake, which means they're also probably a werewolf.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
So if we just hang them both, we're definitely reducing the werewolves' numbers.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Yes, that also means we'll be sacrificing an innocent villager, but in the big picture, we'll be reducing the total number of casualties and improving our odds of victory.  
  
**:**  
Napoleon Bonaparte: Day One Remarks  
  
**Napoleon:**   
I don't do cowardly, and I'm not about  
to kill any innocent people, either.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Sure, I know this is all just a game. But even so, I don't want to rely on underhanded tactics.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
I'm either gonna win boldly, or I'm gonna lose gracefully. That's all there is to it.  
  
**:**  
Fujimaru: Day One Remarks  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry I inadvertently used up our speaking time earlier, Senpai...  
  
**Mash:**   
But if you'd still like to say something, it looks like we have time for at least one more statement.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Honestly, I'm exhausted. I just want to hurry up and turn in for the day.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh! Of course. I'm sorry I didn't realize.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Divination...tonight?  
  
**Mash:**   
Ah!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Looks like we might be pulling an all-nighter.  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne:**   
All right, it's time for the first day to come to an end.  
  
**Mash:**   
Wow! The sun just set instantaneously!  
  
**Voyager:**   
Is that because this is a game?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Ahem! Indeed, it is.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Wow, that's helpful.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Okay players, now I want you all to go to your personal rooms and wait there until morning.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Don't worry.  
This is game time, so it won't take long.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
For those of you with special roles,  
I'll be stopping by to visit you individually.  
  
**Mash:**   
...And now we're in our room, just like that. I guess that's also because we're in a game world right now? What a strange feeling.  
  
**Mash:**   
Speaking of our room,  
it looks like we'll all be sharing it.  
  
**Mash:**   
Ah, I just realized. Since there's only one bed here, what are we going to do about sleeping arrangements?  
  
**Voyager:**   
I'm not sleepy.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't think we'll have much time to sleep, anyway...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right, good point. Since you're the Seer&ndash;  
  
**Mash:**   
Jeanne!? How did you&ndash;  
  
**Jeanne:**   
In-game shortcut. Don't worry about it.  
  
**Mash:**   
I-I, uh, I see...  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Okay, Seer Fujimaru,  
it's time for you to take your turn.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Whose identity will you divine?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nursery Rhyme's.  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Very well then, come with me.  
We'll take the in-game shortcut to go see her.  
  
**Mash:**   
Wouldn't it be simpler to just use the door?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Maybe, but even the act of audibly leaving and entering a room can betray crucial information to other players, which would put you at a significant disadvantage.  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh! I see!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
After everything that happened during the day, would it really matter if&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Okay, here we go.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Oh, you should know that there'll be enemies waiting for us along the way, so watch out for that!  
  
**Mash:**   
Is it just me, or are there a lot of aspects  
to this game that make no sense whatsoever!?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
That's just the way it was designed.  
Get used to it.  
  
＄94-04-77-46-2-0  
  
**Mash:**   
Where are we?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Nursery Rhyme's room.  
But we're only observing it from the shortcut area.  
  
**Mash:**   
She's certainly sleeping soundly, isn't she?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
All right, Seer Fujimaru, go ahead.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
See Nursery Rhyme's true identity for yourself.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...!  
  
---  
  
**:**  
...Werewolf  
  
**Mash:**   
You did it, Senpai!  
Then, this means Nursery was&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Telling the truth, yeah.  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
So, is she going to attack someone now?  
  
**Mash:**   
Huh?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
The werewolves take their turn last, after all the other roles.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Are you going to go help them?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
I have to, if they're going to take their turn.  
  
**Voyager:**   
You're going to take them to kill somebody?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
That's the name of the game.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Weird.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Okay, that ends your turn for the night.  
Let's get you back to your room.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
There'll be enemies on the way back too, but once you're done with them, it won't be long until morning.  
  
＄94-04-77-47-1-0  
  
**:**  
                                  – Day Two –  
  
**Mash:**   
And all of a sudden, it's morning again...  
  
**Jeanne:**   
It's now the second day.  
Would you all gather round, please?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Morning, everyone! Lovely weather today, isn't it?  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Salut!  
  
**Charlotte Corday:**   
Wait. Huh? It's morning already?  
  
**Edison:**   
Morning! I'm glad to see you're all here!  
  
**Mash:**   
Now that you mention it,  
it does look like everyone's still here!  
  
**Mash:**   
Does this mean the werewolves  
didn't kill anyone last night?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Now, let's go over what happened last night.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Tell us, those of you claiming to be Seers:  
Whose identity did you divine last night?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Nursery Rhyme's.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Same.  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne:**   
And what was her true identity?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Exactly what she claimed to be yesterday.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's true. She really is a werewolf.  
  
---  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh my!  
  
**d'Eon:**   
It seems they both reached the same conclusion.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Interesting.  
I wonder if this was coincidence, or just inevitable.  
  
**Salieri:**   
They're cheating!  
They must have conspired on their answers!  
  
**Salieri:**   
I can't believe you'd stoop so low  
as to consort with Amadeus, Fujimaru!  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Knock it off, Salieri!  
What they would even hope to gain by conspiring?  
  
**Salieri:**   
What would they hope to gain? Do you even need  
to ask!? They clearly mean to kill all of us!  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Okay, I guess you've got a point. We can hear what you have to say, but wait till it's time for your remarks.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Hey, last night. You didn't kill anyone?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...I'm not sure. I think I fell asleep.  
I might even have been dreaming.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I wish they had woken me up like I asked them to...  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Now, here are last night's victims.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Nursery Rhyme...  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Oh. I guess I wasn't dreaming after all...  
  
**Mash:**   
Did she just change into a token!?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
...and Charlotte Corday.  
  
**Charlotte Corday:**   
At least I was happy while it lasted!  
  
**Mash:**   
Charlotte too!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why two of them? Isn't there only one werewolf victim per night?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I thought there was only one werewolf victim each night.  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Usually, yes. But those two happened to be the Lovers.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Although Nursery Rhyme was a werewolf,  
and Charlotte, a villager...  
  
**Jeanne:**   
...they still managed to find love in each other's arms.  
  
**Marie:**   
I see. And since one of the Lovers died, the rules  
say that the other had to follow, right?  
  
**d'Eon:**   
The other werewolf must have gone after Charlotte, unaware that would also kill their, um, pack mate.  
  
**Gilles:**   
Or, the other werewolf may have gone after Nursery from the very start to prevent her from talking.  
  
**Phantom:**   
Ahh, my beloved angels. Why? Why did you have to die!?  
  
**Sanson:**   
So why did they turn into tokens?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
That's what happens to fallen Servants here.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
It's one of the core rules to all of Monde du Jeu.  
  
**Edison:**   
What!? You mean every token is made from a Servant!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Does that include our tokens, too?  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Yes, I expect they were all manufactured in the same way.  
  
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
**Voyager:**   
It's okay.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Their roles just changed, that's all.  
They'll go back to normal in their original worlds.  
  
**Mash:**   
Are you sure?  
  
**Voyager:**   
I think so. Because each world has different rules.  
  
**Mash:**   
They do?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Does that mean this world wasn't always like this?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I see... So it's this whole world that's gotten messed up.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
...Now I understand.  
So once we get back to our original world...  
  
**Mash:**   
...Chaldea's rules will be the ones governing us,  
instead of Monde du Jeu's!  
  
**Mash:**   
Then we'll do everything we can to save Nursery and the other Servants, Senpai!  
  
**Marie:**   
It sounds like you are all playing games in pursuit of a larger goal.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Uh-huh. We're looking for Erice.  
  
**Marie:**   
Erice?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Do you know her?  
  
**Marie:**   
I'm not sure. But that name sounds familiar somehow.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
I'll hold on to Nursery Rhyme and Charlotte Corday.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
That's all I have to say for now.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
All right, everyone, the rest is up to you.  
I encourage you to use your second day productively.

Antonio Salieri: Day Two Remarks  
  
**Salieri:**   
I only have one thing to say: we need to hang  
Fujimaru! Immediately! Sooner, even!  
  
**Salieri:**   
Need I remind you that [♂ he's /♀️ she's] the only Master here, AND that [♂ he /♀️ she] has two other Servants in [♂ his /♀️ her] party?  
  
**Salieri:**   
What else could [♂ he /♀️ she] and [♂ his /♀️ her] entourage  
be doing here except disrupting our game!?  
  
**:**  
Thomas Edison: Day Two Remarks  
  
**Edison:**   
These slanderous accusations are outrageous!  
  
**Edison:**   
If you knew Fujimaru even half  
as well as I do...  
  
**Edison:**   
...you would know the very idea of [♂ him /♀️ her] coming  
up with any manner of evil scheme is preposterous!  
  
**Edison:**   
The Fujimaru I know is compassionate, hardworking,  
intelligent, and possessed of excellent communication skills! Plus, you never know what ludicrous thing [♂ he /♀️ she] might say next!  
  
**Mash:**   
Um, Edison? Was that last part really necessary?  
  
**Edison:**   
Whoops! Sorry, I'm afraid I got a bit carried away.  
At any rate, the important thing is that [♂ he /♀️ she] is the  
very epitome of a [♂ common man /♀️ common woman]: completely average in  
all areas!  
  
**Edison:**   
Yet [♂ he /♀️ she] has never let that stop [♂ him /♀️ her] from  
accomplishing any number of great feats at Chaldea!  
  
**Edison:**   
I could list countless examples,  
but to name just a few&ndash;  
  
**:**  
(The rest of his ten minutes were spent  
defending Fujimaru.)  
  
**:**  
Charles-Henri Sanson: Day Two Remarks  
  
**Sanson:**   
Fujimaru's character is not the issue.  
  
**Sanson:**   
The issue is [♂ his /♀️ her] role in this game.  
  
**Sanson:**   
As far as I can tell, Fujimaru is innocent.  
  
**Sanson:**   
Or at the very least, I can't detect any hint of falsehood in Mash's behavior.  
  
**Sanson:**   
If their innocence does turn out to be no more than an act, then I will have to commend them for their extraordinary performances.  
  
**Sanson:**   
At any rate, if we assume Fujimaru is indeed  
telling the truth about being the Seer, that of course brings Amadeus under suspicion.  
  
**Sanson:**   
So I say that the first person we should hang  
is not Fujimaru, but Amadeus.  
  
**Sanson:**   
Though of course, I would still advocate for the guillotine over the gallows.  
  
**Sanson:**   
Even if we can't get our hands on a real one,  
it would still serve the same function.  
  
**:**  
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Day Two Remarks  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Picky picky, aren't we? If you love guillotines  
so much, maybe you should marry one!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Then again, I suppose I shouldn't be joking around now that you're directly calling for my execution, should I?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Well, while I could make any number of arguments,  
I don't think I'll bother.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
After all, I doubt you'd find any of them convincing!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
That being said, I would like you all to consider this:  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Fujimaru and I both claim to be the Seer,  
and we both divined the same player's identity.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
While that particular duel may have ended in a draw, our contest to see who slips up first is still ongoing.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
However, let me remind you that  
I gave my answer before Fujimaru.  
  
**Mash:**   
So what are you saying?  
Are you implying that Senpai cheated?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
If you want to prove [♂ he /♀️ she] didn't,  
then why don't we have a rematch?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Let's see...  
How about we both divine Edison's identity tonight?  
  
**Edison:**   
Me?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
You're obviously a loyal ally of Fujimaru's,  
as well as one of the companions [♂ he /♀️ she] came here with.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
What's more, you look like you'd be more at home in the savanna than a mansion. If anyone here could understand a werewolf's mind, it's clearly you.  
  
**Edison:**   
Didn't you ever learn not to judge a book by its cover!? It's what's on the inside that counts, and on that front, I've got brains and bravery to spare!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
There you have it, Fujimaru.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Let's you and me prove Edison's innocence,  
and your role in this game, together.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're on!  
  
---  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Excellent. Then we shall see the results of this latest contest tomorrow. Nobody hang me until then, okay?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
...Hey! Why isn't anyone saying anything!?  
  
**:**  
Marie Antoinette: Day Two Remarks  
  
**Marie:**   
Poor Amadeus. I'm sorry nobody trusts you. I guess all your naughty behavior hasn't done you any favors.  
  
**Marie:**   
But I've known you since we were both children,  
and I know you're not a bad person.  
  
**Marie:**   
If anything, I'd say Salieri seems much more dangerous. I mean, he's an Avenger. He's practically a walking ball of hostility.  
  
**Marie:**   
I'm honestly worried that he might end up attacking  
all of us if we don't do something to stop him.  
  
**Marie:**   
I'm sorry to say this, but...  
this is just how the game is played.  
  
**Marie:**   
...You're the one who's going to hang, Salieri.  
  
**Salieri:**   
What!? Not you too, my queen!?  
I thought you were wiser than that!  
  
**Salieri:**   
Amadeus! You planned for this to happen, didn't you!? It's your fault the queen is treating me like a criminal!  
  
**Salieri:**   
Fine, if that's what you want, I'll take up the  
sword...and plunge it straight into your gut!  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Stop it! No fighting between players!  
It's against the rules!  
  
**Salieri:**   
You expect me to care about rules now that my good name has been ruined? Ha! At this point, I have nothing more left to lose!  
  
**Mash:**   
What do we do, Senpai!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We've gotta stop him!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right!  
  
＄94-04-77-47-2-0  
  
**Salieri:**   
Arrrgh...!  
  
**Marie:**   
Goodness, I can't believe he got so worked  
up over a little game. What a boor.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Are you all right, Maria?  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh yes, I'm fine.  
It's a good thing Fujimaru was here to save me.  
  
**Marie:**   
Whereas someone else I could mention  
turned out to be no help at all.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Hey, that's no fair.  
You know I'm always here for you...  
  
**Jeanne:**   
I'll be keeping an eye on Monsieur Salieri to make sure there aren't any more...outbursts. In the meantime, the rest of you may continue with your remarks.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Eesh. All right, guess I'll go next.  
  
**:**  
Napoleon Bonaparte: Day Two Remarks  
  
**Napoleon:**   
From this point forward, we'll need to choose someone to hang every day. That's fine. I don't like it, but it's how the game is played.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Truth be told, I didn't really get how terrifying  
these werewolves could be up until now.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
I figured if one of them came after me,  
I could easily just blow them away.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
But after seeing what happened here this morning,  
I've changed my mind.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Nursery Rhyme and Charlotte didn't disappear the moment they were attacked. They were still alive just a while ago.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
They were thinking, moving, talking...right up until they became tokens before our eyes.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Now I know that the werewolves' weapon isn't fangs, but a curse&ndash;an inescapable curse of pure destruction.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
And the only way for us powerless villagers to protect ourselves is to hang the werewolves before they can get us.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
So, who do we hang first?  
  
**Napoleon:**   
I don't know about you guys, but I'm gonna use the time we have until the vote to think about that.  
  
**:**  
Emiya Alter: Day Two Remarks  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
I don't have much to say.  
Even if I did, it'd be forgotten soon anyway.  
  
**:**  
Chevalier d'Eon: Day Two Remarks  
  
**d'Eon:**   
There is one thing I'm curious about.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
I am a knight. It is my sworn duty to  
protect those who are precious to me.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
I am also told there is a player in this very mansion with the same role, at least for the purposes of this game.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
It is this Knight's job to protect the helpless  
villagers from werewolf attacks.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
So I cannot help but wonder how  
they are feeling right now.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
I am sure they must have chosen someone to protect last night, yet they did so to no avail.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Both Nursery Rhyme and Charlotte Corday died thanks to their role as Lovers.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Nursery Rhyme revealed that she was one of the werewolves, and she also said she knew who the other one was.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
The other werewolf must have killed her to keep her from talking. I am sure the Knight could have foreseen this.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
But it wasn't enough to only keep Nursery Rhyme safe...  
  
**d'Eon:**   
...since she was also one of the Lovers.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
It was clear from the way they behaved towards each other that Nursery Rhyme and Charlotte were in love...  
  
**d'Eon:**   
...and the Knight would have known that  
they could only protect one of them.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
So the Knight must have had to make a difficult decision.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
They would have to bet on whether the other werewolf would go after Nursery Rhyme, or Charlotte.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
If the werewolf had chosen to go after the same target the Knight chose to protect, then all would be well. But if the Knight bet wrong, well...  
  
**d'Eon:**   
...That is why I worry for the Knight. As a member of their profession, I know how they must be feeling.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
That being said, Charlotte may have been destined to end up a victim the moment she took a werewolf as her lover.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Still, that does not mean we could simply abandon her to her fate. All the more so for the Knight...  
  
**:**  
Gilles de Rais: Day Two Remarks  
  
**Gilles:**   
...A knight's duty, huh.  
As a knight myself, d'Eon's words ring painfully true.  
  
**Gilles:**   
Whoever our Knight may be, I have no doubt that they are doing their best to fulfill their duty, even within the confines of this game world.  
  
**Gilles:**   
But I myself haven't the slightest idea what I should be doing.  
  
**Gilles:**   
There is one question that eats away at me:  
Who am I?  
  
**Gilles:**   
D'Eon's loyalty to the royal family is unshakable, and Her Majesty continues to reign in a matter befitting a born ruler.  
  
**Gilles:**   
And yet, I wonder: Is that truly for the best?  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh? You would dare to question my judgment, Gilles?  
  
**Gilles:**   
Forgive me, my queen! I hope you can overlook these words as the ramblings of a hardheaded old knight.  
  
**Gilles:**   
...A knight, hmm.  
It feels presumptuous to even call myself that.  
  
**Gilles:**   
This is the Monde du Jeu, a world of games. And we, each of us, have our roles to play in this game.  
  
**Gilles:**   
As such, our loyalty should lie solely with the game's rules, without regard for our original relationships.  
  
**Gilles:**   
In other words, we should all be performing as  
our roles in this world, not as ourselves.  
  
**Gilles:**   
Yet even having reached this conclusion myself after a great deal of thought, I find myself resistant to accepting it.  
  
**Gilles:**   
I am a knight. A noble! The commander of the entire French army! My soul simply refuses to be anything else!  
  
**Gilles:**   
I... I simply cannot resist the sway my desires hold over me. Not even to play pretend in a game.  
  
**Gilles:**   
Please, tell me, my queen. Who am I now?  
  
**Gilles:**   
Now that I am no longer a knight,  
am I anything more than an empty shell...?  
  
**:**  
Phantom of the Opera: Day Two Remarks  
  
**Phantom:**   
...This oppressive weight! This disgraceful showing! The lamentations of my angel would be one thing...but that man stands on the brink of madness!  
  
**Phantom:**   
Ahh, my angel. My dream, my beauty, my hopes...  
Why did you have to depart this world?  
  
**Phantom:**   
Very well then, I will go after you myself. I will cross the border that divides us, and follow you to the ends of the dream of the world beyond...  
  
**:**  
Fujimaru: Day Two Remarks  
  
**Mash:**   
You're next, Senpai.  
What would you like to say?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I got nothing. How about you, Mash?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Me?  
  
**Mash:**   
All right... But I can only think of one thing to say.  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai, and of course Voyager and me, are innocent!  
  
**Jeanne:**   
...Has everyone had their turn to speak?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Then let's move on to the vote.  
  
**:**  
                                Vote – Day Two  
  
**Jeanne:**   
All of you, go ahead and point at the  
player you think should be hanged.  
  
**:**  
Accused: Fujimaru  
  
**:**  
Accuser: Antonio Salieri  
  
**:**  
Accused: Antonio Salieri  
  
**:**  
Accusers: Marie Antoinette,  
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart...

Accuser: Chevalier d'Eon  
Accuser: Gilles de Rais  
  
**:**  
...Phantom of the Opera,  
Napoleon Bonaparte...  
  
**:**  
...Thomas Edison,  
Emiya Alter...  
  
**:**  
...and Fujimaru.  
  
**:**  
Accused: Marie Antoinette  
  
**:**  
Accuser: Charles-Henri Sanson  
  
**Jeanne:**   
The votes have been tallied. Antonio Salieri's  
execution will be carried out right away.  
  
**Salieri:**   
It seems this is as far as I go.  
Good luck enjoying this farce of a game.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Salieri was a villager.  
I'll hold on to his token.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
And with that, the second day has come to an end.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
All players, go back to your personal rooms  
and wait there until morning.  
  
**Marie:**   
Before we go, there's one thing I'd like to ask.  
  
**Marie:**   
Was I imagining things, Sanson, or did you accuse me of being a wolf?  
  
**Sanson:**   
I'm just as surprised as you, Marie. I didn't suspect you in the slightest, and yet...my finger pointed at you practically on its own!  
  
**Sanson:**   
It was as though it had a will of its own,  
and was trying to fight against fate itself.  
  
**Sanson:**   
Then again, perhaps Commander Gilles de Rais is right, and I should be trying to play my part as best I can...  
  
**Sanson:**   
As this is a game, there are rules we must obey if we are to complete it.  
  
**Sanson:**   
However, I am still an executioner at heart. If anyone is going to give you a dignified death, Your Majesty, it should be me.  
  
**Marie:**   
Sanson...  
  
**Mash:**   
...And just like that, it's night again.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I hope we can finish this game soon  
so we can go look for Erice.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Okay, Seer Fujimaru.  
It's time for you to take your turn.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Whose identity will you divine?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Edison's.  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Understood. Then please, come with me.  
And watch out for the wandering souls on the way.  
  
＄94-04-77-47-3-0  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Here we are at Edison's room.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
All right, Seer Fujimaru, go ahead.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
See Edison's true identity for yourself.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...!  
  
---  
  
**:**  
...Villager  
  
**Mash:**   
What a relief!  
  
**Jeanne:**   
And that ends tonight's turn!  
Be careful on the way back.  
  
＄94-04-77-48-1-0  
  
**:**  
                                  – Day Three –  
  
**Mash:**   
And now it's morning again.  
We really don't have any time to rest here, do we?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
It's now the third day.  
Would you all gather round, please?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Bonjour, Maria. You look lovely as ever today.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Salut, mes chers amis!  
  
**Edison:**   
...Hm? Are we missing someone?  
  
**Mash:**   
Now that you mention it, I don't see Phantom anywhere...  
  
**Jeanne:**   
I'm actually a little perplexed about that, too.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
It shouldn't be possible for anyone to disappear from this mansion while a game is taking place, and yet, I can't find him anywhere.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
There may be another power here, somehow working to interfere with the game's rules.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Anyway, let's get back on track and go over last night's events.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Tell us, those of you claiming to be Seers:  
Whose identity did you divine last night?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Thomas Edison's.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Same.  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne:**   
And what was his true identity?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Villager.  
  
---  
  
**Amadeus:**   
He was a perfectly ordinary human...er, lion.  
  
**Edison:**   
Well of course! I've always been at the forefront of intelligence and civilization, after all. My appearance aside, there's no one around less bestial than me!  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Next, we have last night's victim:  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Gilles de Rais.  
  
**Gilles:**   
Thank goodness.  
Now I can go back to being my true self...  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Gilles de Rais was a villager.  
I'll hold on to his token.  
  
**Mash:**   
Poor Gilles...  
He just couldn't stand being an ordinary villager.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
That's all I have to say for now.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
All right, everyone, you take it from here.  
Make sure you use your third day productively.  
  
**:**  
Napoleon Bonaparte: Day Three Remarks  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Damn, what kind of game did I get myself mixed up in!? All this subterfuge stuff isn't for me. I'm way more of a “cards on the table” kind of guy.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Hey, werewolf? I know there's still one of you here.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
How about coming clean and telling us all who you are? That'd wrap everything up nice and neat.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Yeah! I like that idea a lot!  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Yeah? I appreciate that. Thanks for the support, kid.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
You hear that, you damn cowardly werewolf!? We're sick and tired of sneaking and lying like this!  
  
**Napoleon:**   
If you come clean and tell us who you are right now, I'll be nice and spare you from the gallows.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
'Course, I'll make up for that by blasting  
you away with my Noble Phantasm!  
  
**:**  
Charles-Henri Sanson: Day Three Remarks  
  
**Sanson:**   
Good grief, this is ridiculous. What kind of wolf would be so cowed by threats as to give their identity away?  
  
**Sanson:**   
Not to mention that Mr. Bonaparte's remarks are clearly against the rules. What was he thinking? Disparaging the game's designated execution method in favor of his own brand of so-called justice...  
  
**Sanson:**   
Matters like this should be conducted strictly as the law ordains. Even a werewolf deserves fair and impartial treatment.  
  
**Sanson:**   
When we do find this werewolf, would you all mind if I were the one to carry out their execution? Of course, I don't mean by hanging, but by the method I'm more...accustomed to.  
  
**Sanson:**   
Yes, I would like nothing more than to witness  
the kiss of steel meeting neck once again...  
  
**Marie:**   
Please snap out of it, Sanson.  
You haven't been yourself since yesterday.  
  
**Sanson:**   
Ahh, Marie! Marie! If only you were the other werewolf! No, even if you weren't...  
  
**Sanson:**   
I'd still want nothing more than to execute you myself!  
  
**:**  
Marie Antoinette: Day Three Remarks  
  
**Marie:**   
I'd just like to ask everyone to please forget Sanson's remarks. He's always been a very earnest man, you see...  
  
**Marie:**   
So I think he's just gotten so caught up in his role in this game that it's made him a little, um...Berserkery.  
  
**:**  
Chevalier d'Eon: Day Three Remarks  
  
**d'Eon:**   
I understand how you feel, my queen, but I must remind you that all will be decided by the vote.  
  
**Marie:**   
Why, d'Eon, I'm shocked. How can you call yourself a knight and ignore your friend when he's in danger!?  
  
**Marie:**   
Do you WANT Sanson to be suspected of being a werewolf!?  
  
**d'Eon:**   
As you say, my queen, I am indeed a knight.  
But only in our original world.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Here in this game, you and I are both  
players who stand on equal ground.  
  
**Marie:**   
I... Well, yes, I suppose that's true, but still...  
  
**d'Eon:**   
We've been letting our original roles  
hold us back since this game began.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Remember what Gilles de Rais said?  
  
**d'Eon:**   
He found himself lost without his accustomed  
role as a knight to fall back on.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Perhaps the werewolf laying him to rest was actually acting out of mercy.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
I suspect Sanson's odd behavior may also stem from being trapped by his current role. Even if he were this game's executioner, he would have no need to actually sully his own hands.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
So then, what are we to do?  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Simple! We must play our parts as best we can, whether they be kindhearted villager or cunning wolf!  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Fortunately, I believe I can play my part convincingly as long as I commit, thanks to my experiences as a spy.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
What about you, my queen&ndash;no... Marie?  
  
**Marie:**   
...Does this mean you won't obey me anymore?  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Only for the duration of this game.  
  
**Marie:**   
You big meanie!  
  
**:**  
Thomas Edison: Day Three Remarks  
  
**Edison:**   
Now that my villager status is beyond suspicion, allow me to make the case for supporting human rights, and for treating this werewolf humanely!

(The rest of his ten minutes were spent  
passionately elaborating on his position.)

**Emiya Alter:**   
I've got nothing to say.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Day Three Remarks  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Oh, is it my turn now?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Why don't you go ahead of me this time, Fujimaru?  
Just for a change of pace.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't mind me. Please, take your turn.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
All right then, in that case  
  
---  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Are you sure?  
All right then, we'll save the best for last again.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
You hear that, everyone?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Fujimaru always makes [♂ his /♀️ her] remarks last.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
[♂ He /♀️ She] only decides what [♂ he's /♀️ she's] going to do after  
everyone else has gone first. It's a smart way to play!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Anyway, I don't have much to say this time, but I will say that I was quite touched by His Excellency Napoleon's fiery speech.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Damn you, werewolf!  
Come out and face us with honor, you coward!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Ahh, that was so cool! It made me wish I'd been born as the kind of person who could get away with making big, bold statements like that!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Still, I guess I can't complain too much, seeing as the gifts I WAS born with were quite remarkable in their own right.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Anyway, I know people.  
I know how they respond to circumstances like these.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
They get furious! Angry! Hateful! They throw stones, cast blame, and demand executions! They convince themselves that whoever speaks loudest speaks the truth!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
And all the while, they fail to realize that their rage and excitement come not from themselves, but from those around them...  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Basically, what I'm trying to say is that nothing good ever comes from raised fists and loud proclamations!  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Oh? And since I'm known for both, is that  
your way of saying you suspect me?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Not at all! I just mean that we should be careful  
not to let ourselves get caught up in the moment.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
So I ask you all to be wary of those who proclaim their innocence while hiding in the shadows of those with clamorous voices, because those are the types that are sure to be hiding a werewolf.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
And while there's a case to be made that  
Fujimaru falls under that category...  
  
**Amadeus:**   
...I'd say the one we need to be  
the most wary of is you, Emiya.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Oh?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
See? You always act like all this has nothing to do with you. And as a result, oftentimes, the rest of us don't even notice you're here.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
And now, it's the third day, and you're still alive and well. I have to say, your survival tactics are impressive!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
But...you can't pull the wool over my eyes.  
I'm the Seer, after all.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
So tonight, I'm going to find out who you really are. I'm going to uncover every last secret you've got hidden behind those empty-looking eyes of yours.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
And on that note:  
I take it you know what comes next, Fujimaru?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Surely you're not going to start  
refusing my challenges now!  
  
**:**  
Fujimaru: Day Three Remarks  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I get it. I'll divine Emiya's identity tonight.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
At this point, I don't think we have any other choice.  
  
**Mash:**   
...Though I have to say, it feels like Amadeus  
is doing a remarkably good job of boxing us in.  
  
**:**  
Fujimaru: Day Three Remarks  
  
**Voyager:**   
Can I say something?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Go ahead.  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
Thanks. I don't have that much to say...  
  
**Voyager:**   
But because it looks like everybody is leaving soon...  
  
**Voyager:**   
...I thought I should at least say goodbye.  
  
**:**  
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Day Three Remarks  
  
**Amadeus:**   
My oh my! Saying goodbye already? You don't think you might be getting ahead of yourself just a tad?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Why, that almost makes it sound as if you're planning to fly the coop at the first sign of trouble.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Come to think of it, not even our esteemed  
Ruler knows where Phantom disappeared to...  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Surely you're not planning to up  
and vanish like him, are you?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No way!  
  
---  
  
**Amadeus:**   
“No way,” huh?  
Well of course you'd say that, wouldn't you!?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Well, that's all right.  
Even I don't really think you're going to run away.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
No, I'm more concerned about you, Emiya, and how barely present you've been this whole game.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
...You're barking up the wrong tree.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Oh please, don't give me that. I don't know what it is you're up to, but I do know you've been suspiciously quiet.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
You haven't been giving any fiery speeches like Napoleon, or wasting our time with long-winded diatribes like Edison.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
You also haven't been subjecting us to your personal fetishes like Salieri and Sanson, or hamming it up like Maria and her merry crew.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
No, you've just been sticking strictly to the background, remaining firmly out of sight and beneath suspicion.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
But, unfortunately for you,  
you can't put anything past me and my Seer eyes!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
So get ready, Emiya, because tonight...  
  
**Amadeus:**   
...Fujimaru and I are going to find  
out what you really are once and for all.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
...Right, Fujimaru?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay. I'll divine Emiya's identity tonight.  
  
---  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Now we're talking!  
I'm so glad you're such a good sport!  
  
**Mash:**   
Um...I'm not so sure sportsmanship is the issue here...  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Don't bother.  
Let him make a fool of himself if he wants.  
  
**Mash:**   
(Sigh)...  
  
**Jeanne:**   
...I take it everyone's had their turn to speak?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Then let's move on to the vote.  
  
**:**  
                              Vote – Day Three  
  
**Jeanne:**   
All of you, go ahead and point at the  
player you think should be hanged.  
  
**:**  
Accused: Charles-Henri Sanson  
  
**:**  
Accusers: Marie Antoinette,  
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart...  
  
**:**  
...Chevalier d'Eon,  
Napoleon Bonaparte...  
  
**:**  
...and Thomas Edison.  
  
**:**  
Accused: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart  
  
**:**  
Accusers: Charles-Henri Sanson,  
Emiya Alter...  
  
**:**  
...and Fujimaru.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
The votes have been tallied. Charles-Henri Sanson's  
execution will be carried out right away.  
  
**Sanson:**   
...Very well. If this is what fate has in store for me, then so be it. But before I go, I would like to make one last request.  
  
**Sanson:**   
Please, no more hangings. The guillotine is much more humane, at least in that it causes no undue suffering.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Sanson was a villager.  
I'll hold on to his token.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
And with that, the third day has come to an end.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
All players, go back to your personal rooms  
and wait there until morning.  
  
**Mash:**   
This is pretty tiring, isn't it?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Are you okay?  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh, yes, I'm all right.  
I appreciate your concern.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Damn, he beat me to it...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Whoa! I've never seen anything so princely before!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
...Is something wrong, Senpai?  
You look kind of, um, rattled...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm fine. It's nothing...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm okay. I just saw something really precious, is all...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh... I, um, hope I didn't say anything too odd?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Don't worry. You didn't do anything wrong.  
  
**Mash:**   
Thank you, Voyager.  
  
**Mash:**   
I can't blame you for feeling rattled, Senpai.  
Game or not, this has all been extremely tense.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Okay, Seer Fujimaru,  
it's time for you to take your turn.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Whose identity will you divine?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Emiya's.  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Understood. All right, let's go.  
And be careful not to get lost.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait. Lost?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is it even possible to get lost here?  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne:**   
I'm just being cautious. At this point, nothing that happens in this mansion would surprise me.  
  
＄94-04-77-48-2-0  
  
**Jeanne:**   
This is it: Emiya's room.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
So you really did come.  
You're playing right into Amadeus's hands.  
  
**Mash:**   
You're awake, Emiya!?  
I didn't think that was possible!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
It's no big deal.  
I have my own job to take care of after this.  
  
**Mash:**   
Then, does that mean&ndash;  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
I'm the Knight. Go ahead and divine my identity if you don't believe me.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
What will you do, Seer Fujimaru?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Do you still want to uncover Emiya's identity?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hey, we've already come this far.  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Then go, and fulfill your duty.  
  
**:**  
...Knight  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Satisfied?  
  
**Mash:**   
Then, you've been protecting people all this time, Emiya?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Not that I've ever succeeded.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
I tried protecting Sanson last night, but the werewolf went after Gilles de Rais instead.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
I already forgot who I chose the night before last...  
but whoever I bet on, I obviously failed.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What about tonight?  
  
---  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
I guess I can tell you guys.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Tonight, I plan on protecting d'Eon.  
  
**Mash:**   
D'Eon? How come?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Surprised? Let's just say I've got my reasons.  
  
**Mash:**   
Like what?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
I'm not going to tell you that.  
Besides, it'd probably ruin the game if I did.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
But I'll give you a hint. Remember, Gilles was the one attacked last night. Think about why he died instead of Sanson.  
  
**Mash:**   
So, you're saying that although Sanson ended up being hanged today...he could just as easily have been attacked last night, too?  
  
**Mash:**   
And tonight, d'Eon is in danger for the same  
reason Gilles was attacked yesterday?  
  
**Mash:**   
What could that reason be...?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
All right, enough chitchat.  
I've got a job to prepare for.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
And I've got a feeling it's going to be a long night...  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Okay, Seer Fujimaru,  
that's it for your turn tonight.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Let's hurry and get you back to your room.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
For some reason,  
I've got a bad feeling about tonight...  
  
＄94-04-77-48-2-1  
  
**Mash:**   
What's going on, Senpai!?  
Why would Phantom team up with ghosts to attack us?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
I don't understand it either.  
There's nothing in the rules to account for this.  
  
**Voyager:**   
That one got angry.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Because we're inside someone else's dream.  
A really bad dream.  
  
**Voyager:**   
So it's easy for him to leave if he really wants to.  
  
**Voyager:**   
He's inside a dream of his own.  
Where he and his invisible angel can be together.  
  
**Voyager:**   
So I think we should just leave him be.  
  
**Mash:**   
...You're really full of surprises, Voyager.  
I didn't expect you to understand Phantom so well.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I understand.  
He reminds me of Erice.  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice, huh... What's she like?  
  
**Voyager:**   
She's someone you'd find anywhere,  
but she's also one of a kind.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Because she's lonely. She's lonely like I am.

                                  – Day Four –  
  
**Mash:**   
And now it's daytime again.  
I wonder how Emiya fared after we left.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
It's now the fourth day.  
Would you all gather round, please?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Good morning, everyone!  
How are we this fine day?  
  
**Napoleon:**   
See for yourself.  
We've lost a lot of good people.  
  
**Edison:**   
Indeed. It seems that Emiya is gone now, too.  
  
**Mash:**   
I hope d'Eon's all right, Senpai.  
  
**Mash:**   
Though I have to wonder where Emiya went...  
  
**Jeanne:**   
I actually have something to tell  
you all in regards to that.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Emiya disappeared last night. He's now in the shortcut space that connects the areas of this game world.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Huh? What are you talking about?  
  
**Edison:**   
What's this shortcut space?  
Is that some form of teleportation technology?  
  
**Napoleon:**   
I don't even know what's going on anymore...  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Maybe he disappeared to the same place as Phantom?  
  
**Mash:**   
I think you might be right!  
As a matter of fact, we ran into Phantom last night!  
  
**Marie:**   
Can you tell us what happened?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.  
  
---  
  
**:**  
Fujimaru: Day Four Remarks  
  
**Mash:**   
The three of us went to Emiya's room  
last night to divine his identity.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He turned out to be the Knight.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right. He even admitted as much himself. But right now, we need to tell you what happened on our way back...  
  
**Mash:**   
...and now it looks like Phantom is still wandering around this strange, unknown space.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
And now, Emiya's jumped in as well, apparently on the way back from fulfilling his duties as Knight.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Though I can only imagine what his reasons  
for doing so might have been.  
  
**Edison:**   
Unbelievable! Just how many wondrous illusions  
is this mansion hiding, anyway?  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Let me ask you again just to make sure, Fujimaru.  
Did Emiya really say he'd protect me last night?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Definitely.  
  
---  
  
**d'Eon:**   
And now, here I am, alive and well.  
I guess this means he made the right call.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
But then, why would he up and disappear?  
  
**:**  
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Day Four Remarks  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Why? Simple. He knew the werewolf would  
come for him next, so he ran away.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
The Knight might be able to keep others safe, but there's nothing he can do if the werewolf decides to go after him.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
And now that we all know who the Knight is, he had no  
choice but to run and hide. Pretty smart, I have to say!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Lucky for you that the in-game Knight was here  
to keep you alive, Sir Chevalier d'Eon!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
I guess this makes you the game's damsel in distress!  
  
**d'Eon:**   
...Are you trying to make me mad?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Wait. You're mad right now? Really? I couldn't tell from your expression at all. I thought you were just ashamed.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
How dare you!?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Stop! You can't&ndash;  
  
**d'Eon:**   
#### This insult will not stand!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Eep! Surely there's no need to get violent, is there?  
Heeelp! Save meee♪  
  
**Mash:**   
...Something about the way he's singing his cry for help so...operatically makes me think he's exaggerating.  
  
**Mash:**   
Still, I guess we can't just leave him  
to fend for himself, can we, Senpai?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course not! We have to stop this!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Sigh) No, I guess we can't!  
  
---  
  
＄94-04-77-49-2-0  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Khh...!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Good grief. That was too close for comfort.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Thank you oh so much for saving me, Fujimaru♪  
  
**Mash:**   
We were only following the game's rules.  
You have no one to blame for that but yourself.  
  
**Edison:**   
Agreed. Your behavior has been quite abhorrent, Amadeus. Both on a personal level, and on a chivalrous one.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
I'll say. If I'd been in d'Eon's shoes,  
I'd've slugged you one right then and there too.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Oh come on! So nobody's gonna stick up for me?  
Help me out here, Maria!  
  
**Marie:**   
Hehe. Sorry, Amadeus, but you can't come running to me every time you get yourself into trouble. Sometimes, you just need to face the music♡  
  
**Jeanne:**   
I'll keep an eye on d'Eon. In the meantime,  
the rest of you may continue to&ndash;  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Don't bother! I can't bear to keep on going after being so humiliated!  
  
**:**  
Chevalier d'Eon: Day Four Remarks  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Friends, before we go our separate ways, I would ask that you bring today's vote to an end, for that is the least I can do to atone.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
I would also ask that you suspend all future  
votes until Emiya and Phantom have returned.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
That is our only choice if we are to hang the werewolf and prevent further casualties.  
  
**d'Eon:**   
And that is my final wish as a knight  
who failed to fulfill my duty!  
  
**Jeanne:**   
...The proud knight has fallen on their own sword  
so as to be freed from the mansion's rules.  
  
**Mash:**   
D'Eon...!  
  
**Edison:**   
Is suicide even allowed in this game?  
Or is this some new kind of exploit?  
  
**Edison:**   
Then again, fascinating as this has all been, right now, I suppose the best thing we can do is pray for d'Eon to rest in peace.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Chevalier d'Eon was a villager.  
I'll hold on to their token.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
As for the vote&ndash;  
  
**:**  
Marie Antoinette: Day Four Remarks  
  
**Marie:**   
Is this really the time for that?  
Poor d'Eon just asked us not to go through with it.  
  
**Edison:**   
Hmm. I suppose we have no choice...  
  
**:**  
Napoleon Bonaparte: Day Four Remarks  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Whoa, whoa, hang on there.  
I don't mind putting the vote on hold...  
  
**Napoleon:**   
But do we really think the werewolf's just  
gonna sit back and wait in the meantime?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
I don't know. I'm not sure about anything in this mansion anymore. And at this point, I don't think making new rules will be of much help, either.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Then we've gotta choose someone to hang right now.  
There's nothing else we can do.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Fujimaru and [♂ his /♀️ her] entourage  
all make up one vote.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
And I think it's safe to say now that the  
three of them are definitely the Seer.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
We also know that Edison's a villager, so that just  
leaves three of us unaccounted for: me&ndash;  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Me, and Maria, hm? So one of us three is the werewolf? Ooh, that really narrows it down, doesn't it!? This is so exciting!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
It's okay, I understand. You all think I'm suspicious, right? You think that aaall of this is all my fault!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
So okay. I'm not going to run away,  
and I have nothing to hide.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Go ahead, Fujimaru.  
Divine my identity tonight.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Don't change the subject! We're not talking about tonight. We're talking about whether to hold a vote right damn now!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Oh my, why the hurry, your Imperial Majesty?  
Feeling guilty about something, are we?  
  
**Napoleon:**   
That does it!  
I'm shutting you up myself!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Eeep! Heeelp♪  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm inclined to agree with Napoleon.  
Enough is enough!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I know, but we still have to stop him! It's the right thing to do!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Believe me, I'd like to slug Amadeus one too,but we've still got to help him!

**Mash:**   
I know! And we will!  
  
＄94-04-77-49-3-0  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Why're you stopping me!?  
Don't tell me you're on his side!?  
  
**Mash:**   
We're not on Amadeus's side.  
We're just on the, well, rules' side.  
  
**Mash:**   
At any rate, please try to calm down, Napoleon.  
  
**Mash:**   
Given everything we've seen so far, it seems  
pretty clear what Amadeus's role is, so&ndash;  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Oh me, oh my...oh me, oh my♪  
Somebody save me from the bad, bad guy♪  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Who asked you to compose a new song!?  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Come on, Fujimaru, we can't let him get away with  
this! We need to nail his ass now, before he can kill anyone else!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't worry. It'll be okay.  
  
---  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Oh? How can you be so sure?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Because I know Emiya didn't run away.  
  
---  
  
**Napoleon:**   
He didn't?  
But, Jeanne said&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He just left the confines of the game's rules.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Left the confines of the game's rules...?  
  
**Mash:**   
Now I see! I get what you mean, Senpai.  
  
**Mash:**   
Emiya became a Knight of Freedom and Justice so that he could protect everyone without the rules holding him back!  
  
**Napoleon:**   
A Knight of Freedom and Justice?  
I like the sound of that.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
That's ridiculous! Where's your proof? Besides, you  
can't just go around changing the rules like&ndash;  
  
**Edison:**   
Why not? Didn't we all agree to incorporate a new house rule right at the beginning of this game?  
  
**Edison:**   
One that YOU suggested, no less!?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
...!  
  
**:**  
Thomas Edison: Day Four Remarks  
  
**Edison:**   
I, for one, have no issue adding a Knight of  
Freedom and Justice to the rules whatsoever!  
  
**Edison:**   
And if the werewolf tries to attack anyone tonight, you can bet he's going to have something to say about it!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
This is bullshit! How's the werewolf supposed to be able to win like that!? You're turning this game into a lynch mob!  
  
**Napoleon:**   
It'll just be until Emiya and Phantom come back,  
then we can hold a proper vote again.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
I don't know about you,  
but that sounds like a fair way to play to me.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
I-I guess...  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Unless you want to give yourself up now  
and save us the trouble, of course?  
  
**Amadeus:**   
...Ha! You wish! I'm not one to just give up.  
I'm going to hold out for as long as I can!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
You hear that, Fujimaru!?  
You and I are gonna settle this tonight!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Come divine my identity, if you dare!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I will, don't worry.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It kind of seems moot at this point...but sure.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Now that we've come this far, we're not going to back down without accepting your final challenge, Amadeus!  
  
**Jeanne:**   
And with that, the fourth day has come to an end.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
All players, go back to your rooms  
and wait there until morning.  
  
**Mash:**   
This is it, Senpai.  
Tonight's the night we uncover Amadeus's identity.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All we have to do now is wait for Jeanne to come get us.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right!  
  
**Mash:**   
...  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**Mash:**   
She certainly is taking her time today, isn't she?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...Maybe something happened to her.  
  
**Mash:**   
Like what?  
  
**Voyager:**   
I don't know, but I'm sure it's not good.  
  
**Mash:**   
I hope you're wrong...  
  
**Voyager:**   
...Look out!  
  
**Mash:**   
Huh!?  
  
**Mash:**   
Jeanne? Is that you...?  
  
**Phantom:**   
Raaaaaaaaah!  
  
**Mash:**   
Phantom!?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Watch out!  
  
**Mash:**   
Jeanne! What in the world's going on?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
It's a revolt! They're breaking the rules to&ndash;  
  
**???:**  
#### Grrrrrrrrr!  
  
**Mash:**   
An enemy!?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
No! It's the werewolf!  
  
**Phantom:**   
Christine...!  
Take me with you, Christine!  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Please! You need to end this game...in my place!  
  
**Mash:**   
It got Phantom...and now it's even got Jeanne!  
  
**???:**  
You're next!  
  
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Bad wolf. Aren't you only supposed to attack one person per night?  
  
**Mash:**   
Emiya! I mean, Knight of Freedom and Justice!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
...What kind of silly ass title is that?  
  
**Mash:**   
It was the most fitting name I could come up with for someone protecting us from the shadows, like you are.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
...Hmph. If you say so.  
I already forgot why I'm doing this.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
But, hunting beasts... That, I remember just fine.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll help you bring it down!  
  
---  
  
＄94-04-77-49-3-1  
  
**???:**  
Graaahhh...!  
  
**Mash:**   
The werewolf just changed back into a human!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I knew it!  
  
---  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Heh... Hahahahaah!  
That's right! I was indeed the bad guy all along!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
And thanks to you going along with  
my challenges, Fujimaru...  
  
**Amadeus:**   
I had the time of my life!  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Gurk!  
  
**Marie:**   
That's enough out of you, wolf.  
Go on, get out of here.  
  
**Amadeus:**   
Maria! Ahh, Maria! I couldn't ask for a better curtain call! And now, my deceptive performance is complete!  
  
**Mash:**   
Marie! Edison! Napoleon!  
What are you all doing here?  
  
**Edison:**   
We came to see this through to the end.  
So he WAS the werewolf after all!  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Hang on. What about the last role? The Fanatic?  
  
**Marie:**   
Wasn't there someone else who went missing?  
It was probably them.  
  
**Mash:**   
If you mean Phantom...  
I'm afraid the werewolf got him, too.  
  
**Edison:**   
Hmm. Then I suppose his secrets are gone with him.  
  
**Marie:**   
Now that the Ruler is gone, I guess we're the  
only ones who can say if the game has ended.  
  
**Marie:**   
What do you all think?  
Would you say this qualifies?  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Fine by me.  
  
**Edison:**   
No objections here!  
  
**Voyager:**   
Thank goodness.  
Now we can finally go look for Erice.  
  
**Marie:**   
Say, Fujimaru?  
Would you mind if I came along, too?  
  
**Mash:**   
You want to go with us, Marie?  
  
**Marie:**   
I still want to play more, and I have a feeling I'll find some much more exciting games if I'm with you three.  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh? Is something wrong, my dear little traveler?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**Mash:**   
What's going on with Voyager, Senpai?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you nervous, Voyager?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is something wrong, Voyager?  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh, he'll get used to me soon enough. I just love children. They're so pure and innocent and beautiful.  
  
**Marie:**   
So what do you say, Fujimaru?  
Is it okay if I come along?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If that's what you want.  
  
---  
  
**Marie:**   
Hehe. Why thank you♪  
Vive le Monde du Jeu!  
  
**Mash:**   
Before we go, we still need to figure  
out what to do with these tokens.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
You guys are gonna keep on traveling, right?  
Then you ought to take them with you.  
  
**Edison:**   
Hmm. We may not know much about these mysterious things right now, but we may well find an unexpected use for them in the future.  
  
**Mash:**   
Look, Senpai. All the tokens Jeanne was keeping have made their way to your inventory.  
  
**Mash:**   
Although, Nursery Rhyme is still&ndash;  
  
**Voyager:**   
That game...she said it made her tired.  
She wants to rest.  
  
**Napoleon:**   
Then I'll hold on to her for now. I figure I can at least be her opponent when she feels like playing again.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Look. We can keep moving again.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
That track leads to the next game.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
There you guys are! I was getting kind of worried, since I couldn't get ahold of you.  
What were you all doing?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
There you guys are! I was getting kind of worried, since I couldn't get ahold of you.  
What were you all doing?  
  
**Mash:**   
We were playing a game.  
A long, long game that like a protracted nightmare.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I hope we've woken up...  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Dream, reality, it doesn't matter. Not as long as we've got the willpower, or at least the tenacity, to see things through to the end.  
  
**Edison:**   
Indeed! But regardless, this tram will continue to transport us towards our next board of battle.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I can't wait to see Erice again.  
That's all I want.  
  
**Marie:**   
I'd love to get to know her, too.  
I'm sure she's just lovely.  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
Say, where'd Nursery Rhyme get off to?  
  
**Mash:**   
She's, um...a token now.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
Huh? What are you talking about?  
  
**Marie:**   
I do feel bad about what happened to her,  
but at least I'm here to make up for her absence.  
  
**I：Da Vinci:**   
Sounds like a lot went down.  
Mind filling me in?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Say, where'd Nursery Rhyme get off to?  
  
**Mash:**   
She's, um...a token now.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Huh? What are you talking about?  
  
**Marie:**   
I do feel bad about what happened to her,  
but at least I'm here to make up for her absence.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Sounds like a lot went down.  
Mind filling me in?

**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Okay. I'm sure we've got some time before we reach the next station.

＄94-04-77-50-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
The next game is about to begin, Senpai. I'm kind of excited to see what sort of world we&ndash;  
  
**Mash:**   
...Huh? Is this it?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Nothing's here.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It looks like some kind of outpost, only&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
All I see is a few abandoned buildings...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right. The buildings here are all in ruins.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That one over there looks kind of familiar.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is it just me, or does that one look like a game piece?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Now I remember. This is a game about cultivating land.  
  
**Mash:**   
In fact, I also remember that you and Amadeus were deeply engrossed in a game before we came to Monde du Jeu, Marie.  
  
**Marie:**   
Was I? Really?  
  
**Mash:**   
You were. As I recall, Amadeus was using bandits to steal everything you had!  
  
**Marie:**   
Teehee, that does sound like him.  
But I'm afraid I don't remember anything about it.  
  
**Marie:**   
They're only games, after all, so I always end up forgetting what happens in them once they're over.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Good attitude. No one should ever nurse  
a grudge over what happens in a game.  
  
**Edison:**   
Hmm. If the rules allow for bandits, maybe the players are still in the middle of a game.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay... Then where ARE the players?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Only problem with that theory is, I don't see anyone else around...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Good point, Senpai. Unlike Akihabara, there don't seem to be any natives or Servants around here.  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh... I guess somebody else  
WAS in the middle of a game.  
  
**Edison:**   
Then it's over!? But we didn't even get to see anything! This is like only catching the tail end of a movie!  
  
**Marie:**   
I'll say. This is so disappointing.  
With all this desolation&ndash;  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Yeah. No way there's gonna be another game.  
  
**???:**  
That's right. There won't be.  
  
**Voyager:**   
That voice...!  
  
**???:**  
You guys are too late.  
This game's already over.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice!  
  
**Erice:**   
...So, you came here with those people after all, huh?  
  
**Erice:**   
Well, that's okay. I expected as much...ever since I lost my Command Spells.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Command Spells? What are you talking about?  
  
**Erice:**   
...This world isn't where we belong.  
That's why I'm going to end it.  
  
**Erice:**   
Check out my spoils.  
Quite the lineup, isn't it?  
  
**Erice:**   
Those are the Servants I fought on this stage.  
I mowed them all down and turned them into tokens.  
  
**Edison:**   
Impressive, yes, but it's not as though you fought them all on your own, right? What about the Master that gave you your orders?  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh? I don't have a Master.  
I did do this all on my own.  
  
**Edison:**   
Hm? But every other person we saw in Monde du Jeu's Akihabara was a Master with their own partner Servant.  
  
**Erice:**   
...You think I'm a Servant?  
  
**Erice:**   
Well, you couldn't be more wrong. I'm nobody special...just a human and a grim reaper.  
  
**Erice:**   
I was the only one who had to make do in Akihabara without a Holy Grail to call my own.  
  
**Erice:**   
At least until I met you, Voyager.  
  
**Erice:**   
I'm used to being alone.  
I can get by just fine all on my own.  
  
**Erice:**   
But I do make it a point to end  
travesties like these games.  
  
**Erice:**   
So I completely devastated this stage,  
to make sure nobody could ever play its game again.  
  
**Mash:**   
You did what!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Aren't people supposed to use the games to settle their differences here?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Good point. I do need to defeat you properly,  
seeing as you're the contemptible Master of Chaldea.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(That's one of the weirder challenges I've gotten...)  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
I heard you're trying to save the world. That you command a whole army of Servants like they're your toy soldiers.  
  
**Erice:**   
Ugh. How conceited can you possibly get?  
  
**Mash:**   
You've got it all wrong! The Chaldea Security Organization works to protect human endeavors and uphold ideals like&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
Dress it up however you like. Nobody in their right mind would ever trust an organization of mages.  
  
**Erice:**   
You don't even realize they're just using you,  
Fujimaru. Don't you know there's no difference  
between saving the world and conquering it?  
  
**Erice:**   
It's basically just an excuse for collecting as many Servants as possible. It's all kinds of wrong.  
  
**Erice:**   
That's more power than even a Holy Grail.  
What could you possibly want with it?  
  
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai isn't like that at all!  
Please, trust me, Erice!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't care what you say about me, but don't go picking on Mash.  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai...  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry I got carried away. I just couldn't  
stand to hear her talk about you like that...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who told you that?  
  
**Erice:**   
The Servants I turned into tokens. Every last one of them swallowed your BS all right.  
  
**Erice:**   
I'll admit, your sheer popularity is impressive.  
But then, that must be why they decided to use you.  
  
---  
  
**Edison:**   
Hmm, so she's a conspiracy theorist and a misanthrope determined to see the worst in everyone. How can we reach an understanding like this!?  
  
**Edison:**   
I'd heard that adolescence was a difficult time,  
but this is far worse than I'd imagined!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Then tell us: What are you fighting for?  
What could a lone Rogue Servant like you want?  
  
**Erice:**   
How many times do I have to tell you  
I'm not a Servant? But that aside...  
  
**Erice:**   
All I want...is to take back my world.  
To take back everything I lost.  
  
**Erice:**   
I can't stand this world's messed up version of reality! That's why I'm going to destroy it!  
  
**Voyager:**   
What happened, Erice?  
You weren't this angry before.  
  
**Voyager:**   
If you can't see yourself anymore, then look at me. I'll always be your&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
It doesn't matter what we are to each other!  
Not as long as we're here in this game world!  
  
**Voyager:**   
But, we made a promise...  
  
**Erice:**   
Don't bother making puppy dog eyes at me.  
It's not gonna change anything!  
  
**Marie:**   
Well, that's not very nice.  
How could you make poor Voyager cry like that?  
  
**Erice:**   
Wha...!?  
  
**Erice:**   
...So you're a Chaldean Servant too, huh.  
Are you part of Fujimaru's team?  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh yes. I'm Marie.  
Vive la France♪  
  
**Marie:**   
You know, Voyager's been missing you terribly.  
Do you really have to be so cold?  
  
**Marie:**   
Would it hurt to try being a little nicer to him?  
  
**Erice:**   
B-but then...I'd be no better than Chaldea...  
  
**Erice:**   
Voyager...  
  
**Erice:**   
Ahh... If only there was a way to get  
back to our original Akihabara...  
  
**Erice:**   
Yeah... If we could just do that, I'm sure everything would go back to normal. Even my missing Command Spells, and the promise we made...  
  
**Voyager:**   
I didn't know your Command Spells were gone now, Erice.  
But&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
I'm not gonna leave things like this.  
I'm gonna get it all back. Including you, Voyager.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice? Where are you going?  
Wherever you go, I promise I'll find you again!  
  
**Erice:**   
Stay away from me! I don't want to fight you!  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice!

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Erice, wait!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This game isn't over yet!  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Now what? If you still want to play, then play with your friends. Besides, it's not like I'm your only opponent.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
You aren't?

**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are you talking about?

**Erice:**   
Stall them, brave hero!  
  
**Heracles:**   
  
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)!  
  
**Mash:**   
Heracles's token just turned into the real Heracles!  
  
**Edison:**   
Incredible!  
I had no idea tokens could be used this way!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Is this really the time to be admiring her ingenuity? Take a look at what the big guy's doing.  
  
**Heracles:**   
  
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)!  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh no! Heracles is trying to destroy the tram's tracks!  
  
**Voyager:**   
Stop! If you do that...we'll be trapped!  
  
**Mash:**   
If we don't do something,  
we may never catch up to Erice!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Erice can wait! We have to stop Heracles first!

**Fujimaru 2:**   
First we stop him, then we go after Erice!

Right! Ready for battle, Master!

...But only after he'd already destroyed the tram tracks...  
  
**Heracles:**   
  
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)!  
  
**Mash:**   
Now he's disappearing!  
  
**Voyager:**   
He's going back to his old home.  
  
**Mash:**   
What do you mean?  
Are you talking about Chaldea, or the Throne of Heroes?  
  
**Voyager:**   
I'm not sure...  
But I think his job is over.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Now he's out of the game.  
And free to do what he wants.  
  
**Edison:**   
I see. So tokenized Servants have some sort of contractual relationship here in the Monde du Jeu.  
  
**Edison:**   
Once they've carried out the orders given to them by their owner&ndash;that is, their Master&ndash;they're released from their contractual obligations and can return home.  
  
**Edison:**   
I must say, I'm enormously impressed by your powers of observation, Voyager my boy. How did you figure all that out at a glance?  
  
**Voyager:**   
I can just tell.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I remember you said something along those lines about Erice, too.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's also why you brought us to this world, isn't it?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
You're right, Senpai. You've done an excellent job of guiding us ever since we came here, Voyager.  
  
**Mash:**   
It's almost as though you can tell  
exactly what Erice is feeling.  
  
**Mash:**   
Then again, I also get the impression that you might have some sort of connection to this very world...  
  
**Voyager:**   
...Maybe? I can't really tell.  
  
**Voyager:**   
All I know for sure is that I'm all alone right now,  
just like Erice.  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh? Even though you're here with us?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**Mash:**   
Is something wrong, Voyager?  
Why are you hiding behind me?  
  
**Marie:**   
Teehee, maybe he's shy.  
  
**Marie:**   
So, what do we do, Fujimaru?  
  
**Marie:**   
We can't go after Erice now, and I certainly don't want to stay in this desolate wasteland any longer than I have to.  
  
**Marie:**   
I know. Why don't we go back to Akihabara and go for a walk around the city? Wouldn't that be fun?  
  
**Mash:**   
But, if we did that, there's no telling when  
we might be able to return to Chaldea...  
  
**Marie:**   
What's wrong with that?  
The important thing is that you're having fun♪  
  
**Voyager:**   
No. We can't do that.  
I have to save Erice.  
  
**Mash:**   
Voyager...  
  
**Marie:**   
You still want to save her that badly?  
Even after she told you to leave her alone?  
  
**Voyager:**   
She must have a reason.  
She's not herself right now.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Come on. I have to hurry and catch up.  
  
**Marie:**   
But how are you going to do that?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll just have to walk.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We can still follow the tracks on foot.  
  
---  
  
**Marie:**   
You want to walk? On what?  
  
**Marie:**   
There's nothing there but starry sky.  
  
**Mash:**   
True... That does seem like it would  
be difficult to traverse on foot.  
  
**Edison:**   
No, it's too soon to give up.  
  
**Edison:**   
If a tram can travel across space, then so can we. Especially since its tracks are still present.  
  
**Edison:**   
What's the harm in giving it a go?  
  
**Edison:**   
We can see the path we need to take to the stars.  
All we have to do is follow it!  
  
**Voyager:**   
...Yeah!  
  
**Voyager:**   
I think I can show you the way.  
I'm used to doing that.  
  
**Marie:**   
Well, when you put it that way, it does sound like fun.  
  
**Marie:**   
But I do worry I might get exhausted on the way.  
I wonder if my horsey could walk on these tracks?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
There's no need for us to walk the whole track.  
We can take a shortcut.  
  
**Mash:**   
We can? Do you know of one, Emiya?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
No. But think back to the werewolf house.  
  
**Mash:**   
...Oh, right! There was some kind of network of shortcuts connecting the areas of the game world!  
  
**Edison:**   
I see! You're talking about that teleportation technique you used!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Right. I did that by stepping outside the game's rules. Maybe we can do the same thing here.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
After all, that girl already broke the rules  
when she had the tram tracks destroyed.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Hey kid, you said you can take us to Erice, right?  
Then come stand in front with me.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Okay.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okay! Let's do this thing!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
By the way, just so you know&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So, if this is like the area in the werewolf house...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There will be enemies, won't there?  
  
---  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Good, you get it. That saves us both time.  
  
**Mash:**   
Here they come, Senpai. Something tells me it's better if we don't stray too far from the tracks!  
  
＄94-04-77-50-3-0  
  
**Voyager:**   
Just starry sky, so far.  
It looks like Erice is still a long ways off.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Guess there's only so much distance  
we can cross at a time.  
  
**Edison:**   
Well, we won't find her any sooner standing around here. Let's keep going.  
  
**Mash:**   
You're right, Edison. I'm ready to move on.  
  
**Marie:**   
Say, Voyager, would you mind telling us more about  
your relationship with Erice on the way?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...Erice and I made a promise that we  
would watch over the end together.  
  
**Marie:**   
The end? As in, the end of Monde du Jeu?  
  
**Voyager:**   
I don't know how to say it...  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Watch out, kid.  
We've got more headed our way.  
  
＄94-04-77-50-4-0  
  
**Voyager:**   
Hey, look. Found something.  
  
**Mash:**   
Is that...a token?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Here, you hold onto it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you sure?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thank you.  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
He has a job to do, too.  
I'm sure you can help him do it.  
  
**Mash:**   
...I'm glad you don't seem to hold  
a grudge against Chaldea, Voyager.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Are you still thinking about what Erice said?  
  
**Mash:**   
Honestly, it was kind of shocking for me to hear her say that Servants are treated like a toy army...  
  
**Edison:**   
Yes, well, let's not forget that Erice herself has no problem using tokens and Servants for her own ends!  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice loves Servants.  
She's always looked up to them.  
  
**Voyager:**   
But now she's alone again. She's lonely again.  
  
**Marie:**   
Can you tell us more about her?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...Okay. But I don't know if I can do a good job.  
  
**Edison:**   
It would seem this space is rife with both opportunity and danger. Prepare for battle, everyone!  
  
＄94-04-77-50-5-0  
  
**Voyager:**   
I found another one.  
This one looks kind of evil.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
True, he does look like a walking talisman.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He might look scary, but he's a big softie on the inside.  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
Hold onto it, please.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Uh, you're sure he's not gonna start actingup all of a sudden or anything, right?  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
It's okay.  
  
**Mash:**   
None of the other tokens we've found so far have started spontaneously acting on their own.  
  
**Mash:**   
I think it's safe to assume he's just waiting for you to give him orders, like a Servant.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Like how Erice called on Heracles?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right. I believe you should  
be able to do the same thing.  
  
**Edison:**   
Once we track her down again, there's an excellent chance that she'll make use of tokens if it comes to a fight.  
  
**Edison:**   
So it would be worth your while to collect as many tokens as you can now, do you have more resources to call on in battle.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I wonder how far she went.  
Maybe she already started the next game...  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Then we'd better hurry.  
You can keep talking on the way.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Okay.  
  
**Marie:**   
I have a much clearer picture of Erice now  
that you've told us more about her, Voyager.  
  
**Marie:**   
So she calls herself a grim reaper, and she used to be part of the Akihabara night watch, huh?  
  
**Mash:**   
Don't forget, her role was to defeat any Servants that threatened the city's peace.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Uh-huh. That's her job.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Dirty work, huh.  
  
**Edison:**   
Given her low opinion of Chaldea, it sounded like she has a great deal of respect for Servants...  
  
**Edison:**   
...but in reality, it was her job to take them down when they got out of hand, huh. That's quite the contradiction she must have been facing.  
  
**Voyager:**   
She can't help it.  
Something bad's possessing her.  
  
**Mash:**   
Something...bad?  
  
**Voyager:**   
I don't know what to call it. It's a muddy,  
evil-looking thing that doesn't have a name...  
  
**Marie:**   
You mean like the sludge from the Holy Grail that corrupts anyone it touches and makes them pure evil?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...Yeah, I think so.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Poor kid. So she's been optimized for killing,  
just like me.  
  
**Voyager:**   
...I don't think that's all there is to it.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
That so.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Looks like we can take another shortcut.  
Come on, kid.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Okay.  
  
**Marie:**   
He's not scared of Emiya at all, is he?  
I'm a little hurt.  
  
＄94-04-77-50-6-0  
  
**Voyager:**   
There's another token here.  
This one's a pretty lady.  
  
**Mash:**   
You really do have a talent for attracting  
Servants, don't you, Senpai?  
  
**Edison:**   
While I'm sure [♂ his /♀️ her] accomplishments  
to date are certainly part of it...  
  
**Edison:**   
...I'd bet there's another logical reason for it, too.  
  
**Edison:**   
For example, these may have been left behind by other players Erice defeated.  
  
**Mash:**   
That...does make a lot of sense.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then, in that case...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So, that would mean these tokens are  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I guess they ended up like this without ever  
being able to fulfill their Masters' wishes.  
  
**Mash:**   
They must have a lot of regrets...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Come on, let's hurry.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai. We'll do our best to catch up to Erice as soon as we can.  
  
**Marie:**   
You want to see Erice again soon too, right, Voyager?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...Uh-huh.  
  
**Marie:**   
I remember you told us how, back in Akihabara, where everyone has a Holy Grail and a strong personal bond with their own Servant...  
  
**Marie:**   
...Erice was the only person in the whole city who had to live her life alone, with no Holy Grail or Servant to call her own.  
  
**Marie:**   
But then she met you&ndash;her fated partner.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Uh-huh. That's when she became my Master.  
  
**Voyager:**   
But then, something went wrong.  
After she came to this world and its games...  
  
**Voyager:**   
...the important bond we shared disappeared.  
  
**Mash:**   
...And you want to get it back, huh?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
A bond?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Hah. That's gotta be what's holding her back.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
If she's still fooling herself even now after becoming a Servant, well...I can't come up with much of anything more asinine.  
  
**Voyager:**   
...Please don't be mean.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Sorry, but I can't stand such ridiculous youthful recklessness.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Listen to me, Voyager. Your job isn't to get her back. It's to set her free.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Since she doesn't realize she's a Servant, we'll start by kicking her ass and making her come to grips with reality.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
That'll be your job, Fujimaru.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You mean, because I'm a Master of Chaldea?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
...That's right.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
You command vast numbers of Servants and, more importantly, you're the best, most insolent Master of Chaldea, and you know it.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Which is good enough, right?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
B-because I've been a Master longer than her?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
...Yeah.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
You're the kind of person who just caaan't resist helping someone in trouble no matter how little you know them, right?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
So this job is right up your alley.  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
...I'm sorry.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I didn't know you were so nice, Emiya.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Thank you for caring about Erice.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
...Stop it.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
I just...  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
...Erice isn't much farther. Come on.  
  
＄94-04-77-50-7-0  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ow!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Are you okay, Senpai!?  
  
**Mash:**   
That token came out of nowhere and  
hit you right in the forehead...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ooh, that stings...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think I'm okay, but man, those things hurt...  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So where'd the token go?  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
It's on your shirt.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Whoa, so it is.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
When did that happen?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
After it struck you in your forehead, it stuck to  
your shirt like it was hanging on for dear life.  
  
**Mash:**   
Whoever that Servant is,  
they must really want you to take them with you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I...guess I should be impressed?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well that's not creepy at all.  
  
---  
  
**Edison:**   
Interesting. So the token is generating its own gravity through sheer obsession. It looks like we still have a lot more to learn about their physical properties.  
  
**Marie:**   
So do you think this obsession comes from love, or hate?  
  
**Marie:**   
Then again, maybe there's not much difference either way.  
  
**Marie:**   
What about you and Erice, Voyager?  
Do you two love each other?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...I can't express it in words.  
  
**Voyager:**   
After all, the really important things in life are  
those you can't see or easily describe. Am I wrong?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Shh! Shut up and listen.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Can you hear that?  
  
**Voyager:**   
It's the tram!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
No running! You're going to trip and fall...  
  
＄94-04-77-50-7-1  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice! Erice, it's me! I'm coming!  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai! The next game is about to begin!  
  
＄94-04-77-51-1-0  
  
**Erice:**   
...So, you made it after all.  
  
**Erice:**   
Then I guess I won't be able to  
avoid facing you in this game.  
  
**Erice:**   
Still, since the strongest warrior of all time stalled you for a while, I was able to build up my deck.  
  
**Erice:**   
If I have to fight you...then I won't hold back!  
I'm going to crush you!  
  
**Mash:**   
We did it, Senpai! We caught up to Erice!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's a relief...but this isn't over yet.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Now the hard part begins...  
  
---  
  
＄94-04-77-52-1-0  
  
**Voyager:**   
You're going to fight us, Erice?  
  
**Erice:**   
I have to, or else the nightmare that is this game world will never end.  
  
**Iskandar:**   
So, the time for conquest has come once more!  
  
**Leonidas:**   
If my calculations are correct, then my army is superior in every way possible! Muscle size, muscle strength, and muscle density!  
  
**Romulus:**   
Soon, all shall be mine! All shall be Rome!  
  
**El-Melloi II (Young):**  
Bollucks! We'll never get anywhere if we let these guys call the shots. I'll have to step up and take charge.  
  
**Mash:**   
Uh-oh! Erice's tokens just turned into Servants...  
  
**Mash:**   
...and they're all great, world-conquering heroes!  
  
**Mash:**   
Do you really think we can win against them?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hold that thought. Something's up with our tokens...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wait. Our tokens just started going nuts out of nowhere!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh no. Now what do we do, Senpai!?  
Your tokens are all starting to glow...  
  
**Mash:**   
...and their magical energy is going haywire!  
  
**Darius III:**   
Iskandaaar!  
  
**Arash:**   
No way I can sit out the return of Persia's fearsome king! My arrows are ready to fly!  
  
**Altera:**   
Invasion itself is not bad civilization...but indiscriminate invasion is the very worst civilization.  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai, look! King Darius of Persia is leading our forces in a charge...  
  
**Mash:**   
And he's followed by Arash, the great Persian hero,  
and King Altera of the Huns.  
  
**Mash:**   
They're all just as capable as the Servants on Erice's side...except they're on our side!  
  
**Voyager:**   
A fight...even here?  
  
**Mash:**   
Voyager...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We have to, if we're going to save Erice.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We have to, if we're going to bring this world to an end.  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
...Yeah. You're right. It's the only way.  
  
**Edison:**   
Indeed. Not to mention that this battle is also necessary to free the tokenized heroes from their obsessions and reclaim their freedom.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Whatever the ultimate goal is,  
we've still got to win this first.  
  
**Marie:**   
True. At this point, it seems to be what Erice wants, too.  
  
**Marie:**   
So let's have a good game, shall we? Let's give it our all so we can win or lose with no regrets!  
  
**Erice:**   
...Game? This isn't just a game. This is war.  
  
**Erice:**   
I'm not doing this for fun.  
I'm just doing this to get back what I lost.  
  
**Erice:**   
...Come to think of it, I never did  
introduce myself properly, did I?  
  
**Erice:**   
My name is Erice. Erice Utsumi. I'm part of the Akihabara Night Watch, and I'm sometimes called the Grim Reaper.  
  
**Erice:**   
But right now, I'm just another player.  
And in this game, you're my opponent.  
  
**Erice:**   
Now it's your turn, Master of Chaldea.  
What's your name?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fujimaru.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Fujimaru, huh.  
Got it.  
  
**Erice:**   
But don't expect me to remember it for very long.  
  
**Erice:**   
I couldn't care less about some random mage,  
whether [♂ he's /♀️ she's] from Chaldea or not.  
  
**Erice:**   
All I care about is restoring the bonds I made with my real, precious friends in my own world.  
  
**Erice:**   
So don't worry, Voyager. I'm going to get you back.  
I promise. And to do that...  
  
**Erice:**   
I'm going to wipe the floor with you, Fujimaru!

**Erice:**   
This game is called Orbat Clash. It's about pitting ancient imperial armies against each other.  
  
**Erice:**   
We'll be playing Macedonia vs. Persia, two great nations whose conflict has actual historical roots.  
  
**Erice:**   
As the players,  
you and I will each command an army of Servants.  
  
**Erice:**   
Those Servants will take it in turns to fight for control over nine flags, with one battle per flag.  
  
**Erice:**   
Whichever side claims five flags, or three flags in a row, is the winner.  
  
**Erice:**   
Successfully claiming a flag also nets you a token. Since there's nine flags, there's nine tokens in total.  
  
**Erice:**   
However, you can't claim your  
tokens until the game is over.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
So it's like at the werewolf house?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Someone holds onto them, like Jeanne did for werewolf?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
That's right.  
  
**Mash:**   
I see. So we'll have to fight each flag battle  
with only the warriors we have now.  
  
**Iskandar:**   
I'll be leading the Macedonian army, of course!  
  
**Darius III:**   
  
Isss! Kaaan! DAAARRR!!!  
  
**Mash:**   
Uh-oh! Darius is getting very worked up, Senpai!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, he and Iskandar do have a lot of history.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Guess that means he'll be leading the Persian army then.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I suppose conflict between Darius and Iskandar is inevitable, especially given everything that happened between them...  
  
**Mash:**   
But do you think it will fit within the rules of the game? The way things are going now, they're liable to escalate into all-out war!  
  
**Arash:**   
Don't worry about the general.  
I'll find a way to keep him in line.  
  
**Mash:**   
That's great to hear, Arash! Thank you!  
  
**Darius III:**   
#### MOOOVE!  
  
**Arash:**   
Easy, General. Your enemy's the Great King, remember?  
I doubt he's gonna be part of the vanguard.  
  
**Darius III:**   
HMMMmmm...?  
  
**Arash:**   
So why not sit back, get a good look at the whole battlefield, and make sure you're ready to fight? That way, you'll be good to go at the same time as the opponent you want to face.  
  
**Darius III:**   
HMMMmmm...!  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Say what they will, I actually do like to lead the first charge of the battle. What say you, my Master of this world? Shall I start things off with an early victory?  
  
**Erice:**   
No, Great King, you stay put for now. I've got plenty of other talented generals I can call on in the meantime.  
  
**Erice:**   
For example...!  
  
**Achilles:**   
Hey there. I'm Achilles, a Rider, good to go at any time. Who's my unlucky opponent?  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Achilles!? You're here too!?  
  
**Achilles:**   
S-sure am. What's up with you, big guy?  
Just take it easy, all right?  
  
**Achilles:**   
Or what, is there somebody here with a vendetta against me...again?  
  
**Achilles:**   
Well, if it's a fight you want, I'm happy to oblige!  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Hahahaha! Now that's a great hero for you!  
Not even I'm worthy of his notice!  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Excellent! I can feel my blood boiling with excitement! I'd love to ride into battle by your side!  
  
**Erice:**   
Great. Even though things couldn't be worse  
right now, I'm still so happy I could cry...  
  
**Erice:**   
M-my apologies, Great King,  
but I'm afraid I have to ask you to refrain.  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Really? No good? Hmm.  
I'm still tempted to go out there regardless...  
  
**Iskandar:**   
But, very well. I suppose I can be content with witnessing the legendary immortal warrior in action!  
  
**Achilles:**   
So, everything good here? Yeah? Great.  
  
**Achilles:**   
All right then, let's do this thing! Bring it on!  
  
**Mash:**   
It looks like Erice's side chose their vanguard, Senpai! We should do the sa&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yup, looks like it's our turn!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think one of our tokens is way ahead of you!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
There she is!  
  
**Penthesilea:**   
I knew it. I knew I smelled you, Achi... Achilleeeeees!  
  
**Achilles:**   
Aw, crap. Just my luck.  
  
**Achilles:**   
All right, let's get this over with.  
Bring it on, Queen of the Amazons!  
  
**Penthesilea:**   
You're dead! Dead! Dead, dead, dead, dead!!!  
  
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)!!!  
  
**Mash:**   
Penthesilea is certainly raring to go.  
What do we do for this first round, Senpai?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's just let her do her thing.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't think we could stop her and live totell about it, so...it's all up to her now.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Understood!  
  
**Marie:**   
Okay, let's stay here and cheer her on then.  
  
**Edison:**   
Hmm! While I hate to leave her to fend for herself,  
I'm willing to defer to your judgment, Fujimaru!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
How about you, kid? What're you going to do?  
  
**Voyager:**   
I...  
  
**Mash:**   
Voyager, Senpai, and I have made it this far as a team.  
  
**Mash:**   
But since we're facing Erice this time,  
it's okay if you don't think you're up for it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What do you think?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's up to you, Voyager.  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
I...  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
＄94-04-77-54-1-0  
  
**Voyager:**   
...I don't want to fight you. I want to help you.  
But, if I don't have any choice...  
  
**Erice:**   
Hmph, is that so? Then fine, knock yourself out!  
  
＄94-04-77-54-1-1  
  
**Achilles:**   
Well, hopefully that got it out of her system...  
Nah, that's probably just wishful thinking.  
  
**Penthesilea:**   
Curses... This is only a game. What is the point of killing Achilles in a mere game!?  
  
**Penthesilea:**   
Come back here, Achilles! Achilleeeeees!  
  
**Edison:**   
Looks like we made it past the first hurdle!  
Now this is what I call frontier spirit!  
  
**Marie:**   
You did a wonderful job giving commands too,  
Fujimaru. The Amazon queen's obsession was  
just what we needed to win♪  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Something tells me we're in for more fated matchups.  
  
**Voyager:**   
We won, Erice.  
  
**Erice:**   
Hmph. I was just seeing what your team's made of.  
The real fight starts now.  
  
＄94-04-77-54-1-5  
  
**Penthesilea:**   
Curse you! Curse you...!  
This isn't over! I won't stop until I&ndash;  
  
**Achilles:**   
You never learn, do you?  
  
**Achilles:**   
But, I guess this is just how it's destined  
to go whenever you and I face off...  
  
**Voyager:**   
We lost.  
  
**Marie:**   
Yes, but it was a wonderful battle.  
I can't wait for the next round♪  
  
**Edison:**   
Indeed. The steeper the hurdle ahead, the greater  
the joy when it's finally overcome!  
  
**Erice:**   
Joy?  
  
**Erice:**   
This isn't about joy.  
All I care about is taking back what's mine.  
  
＄94-04-77-55-1-0  
  
**Voyager:**   
...I don't want to fight you.  
I want to help you, Erice.  
  
**Erice:**   
I feel the same way...  
  
**Erice:**   
But that's exactly why I can't back down!  
  
＄94-04-77-55-1-1  
  
**Achilles:**   
Well, hopefully that got it out of her system...  
Nah, that's probably just wishful thinking.  
  
**Penthesilea:**   
Curses... This is only a game. What is the point of killing Achilles in a mere game!?

**Erice:**   
You're my Servant, Voyager.  
Mine and mine alone.  
  
**Erice:**   
I refuse to let Chaldea make you into just another tool.  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice... Please try to understand.  
  
**Mash:**   
I won't&ndash;I can't say that Chaldea never compels anyone to sacrifice anything in the name of a mission...  
  
**Mash:**   
But I can tell you that everything we do  
is necessary to build a better future.  
  
**Erice:**   
I know. You're the protectors of humanity&ndash;  
their endeavors, their dreams, their future...  
  
**Erice:**   
I'll admit, your war's not the kind of ugly, senseless, ego-driven bloodshed that defines most conflicts between mages.  
  
**Erice:**   
But it doesn't change the fact that you're desecrating the familiars&ndash;the Heroic Spirits you use to fight it by treating them so contemptuously.  
  
**Erice:**   
What kind of future can a world possibly have if it has to rely on help from ghosts of the past to get there?  
  
**Mash:**   
Wha...  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Oh? Then what about those tokens you've got? Aren't you using them to fight your battles, just like we are?  
  
**Erice:**   
Khh...  
...Yeah, I am.  
  
**Erice:**   
It's a...necessary evil in this world. I have to use them if I'm going to end Monde du Jeu once and for all.  
  
**Erice:**   
You guys saw what happened to Akihabara. You saw how every living human had been turned into a Meeple.  
  
**Erice:**   
It's wrong. This whole world is just...wrong.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Erice... Can I just say one thing?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Heroic Spirits may come from the past,but that doesn't mean they're staying there.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
All those Heroic Spirits from the past?They're coming to the future with us.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
...You're lying. Heroic Spirits are dead! Just let them rest in peace and stop tarnishing their memory!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I know how you feel.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I hear you. Those are the same feelings I try to hang onto, too.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Liar! You could never understand how I feel!  
  
**Voyager:**   
...You're like a child.  
  
**Edison:**   
It seems she really is just as young as she looks.  
What an embarrassing display of naivete.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Hmph. So you can't stand the idea of the dead walking the earth, huh?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Now you really are sounding like a god of the underworld. So what, you're here to uphold natural law or something?  
  
**Erice:**   
...That's right. I'm going to end everything...  
  
**Erice:**   
...so I can take back my own destiny.  
  
**Erice:**   
Come forth, swiftest of hunters!  
  
**Atalante:**   
Am I here to hunt or to race? Regardless, I doubt there is anyone here who can match me, let alone outpace me.  
  
**Erice:**   
Next, I call upon the legendary captain of the Argonauts!  
  
**Jason:**   
Heh. Let's just get one thing straight. I might be a hero, but I'm no common foot soldier. The walking litter box there can handle the front line all on her own!  
  
**Atalante:**   
Oh, so it is going to be like that? Very well, Jason. Just stay behind me and do not move. If you do that, you will not be hit.  
  
**Jason:**   
What, by you? Huh? You're firing into the  
air above me!?Aaah! Arrow raaain!  
  
**Erice:**   
...Uh...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Shall we get back to the game then?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh? Oh, uh, right. Of course.  
  
**Erice:**   
All right then, let's see what your tokens have got!  
  
**Jason:**   
Eh, this is basically all still just a warm-up, anyway.  
  
**Atalante:**   
Be silent! Let your sword do the talking for once!  
  
**Mash:**   
Here they come!  
Let's prepare to face them, Senpai!  
  
**Arash:**   
Looks like it's not our turn just yet.  
Master, I'll let you decide who&ndash;  
  
**Arash:**   
Hm? Looks like you've got a token who  
really wants to take this fight.  
  
**Mash:**   
So [♂ he /♀️ she] does.  
I can see it jumping up and down in Senpai's hand.  
  
**Arash:**   
Decisive skirmishes like this are all about morale, so if they want to fight that badly, I'd go ahead and let them take it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All right, in that case...  
  
---  
  
**Charlotte Corday:**   
Thank you! Just leave this to me!  
I promise I'll take excellent care of them!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh, when you say, “take care of them”...do you mean, “finish them”?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Take care of them as in, finishing them?  
  
---  
  
**Charlotte Corday:**   
I guess you could put it like that!  
Don't worry, I've done this lots of times.  
  
＄94-04-77-57-1-0  
  
**Voyager:**   
Do I have to fight, too?

**Fujimaru 1:**

**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nope! Don't worry, we've got this!

**Charlotte Corday:**   
Phew... I did it! I really did it!  
  
**Atalante:**   
Very well then, I will abide by the rules and go over  
to the winning side. Besides, I see there is a child  
on that side.  
  
**Atalante:**   
Frankly, I have had enough of girls on the verge of becoming women, and men who are incapable of growing up...  
  
**Jason:**   
Was that aimed at me!? It was, wasn't it!?  
  
**Jason:**   
Well I, for one, have had enough of being treated like a pawn. I'm setting off on my own! Nobody else will tell me what to do! Goodbye and good riddance!

My role in this world is over.  
Now, at last...I can return to helping children...

Hmph. Well aren't you the grand philanthropist? Fine, knock yourself out. Me, I'm gonna take a well-deserved nap.

So they were voyagers, too...  
Travelers on a long, long adventure...  
  
**Jason:**   
Hell yeah, we were! Wanna hear about it?  
  
**Atalante:**   
Do not dare breathe a word about it!  
Keep your insufferable bragging to yourself!

Where is the scribe who will document my triumph?  
  
**Caligula:**   
I...am your...destiny!  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice is going on the attack!  
She's sending out an army of Roman emperors!  
  
**Altera:**   
I will face them.  
  
**Mash:**   
Altera!  
  
**Altera:**   
Nation builders... Instigators... Tyrants... They all feed on mature civilization, and so must all be destroyed.  
  
**Altera:**   
Besides, though I no longer remember it clearly...I do recall that I owe them a debt for a defeat I once suffered at their hands...  
  
**Romulus:**   
Indeed, I am Rome, and I shall strike you down as many times as it takes for you to learn to grovel!  
  
**Romulus:**   
Come, my children!  
Our glorious battle is at hand! To arms!

**Romulus:**   
Come, let us return to the Throne of Heroes...  
To Rome!

Roman prosperity is the Roman hope of all Romankind. Indeed, it is our glorious Roman purpose!  
  
**Caesar:**   
That was a good circus.  
My fans should be very pleased.

**Altera:**   
It seems civilization is...more resilient than I thought...  
  
**Romulus:**   
Roman prosperity is the Roman hope of all Romankind. Indeed, it is our glorious Roman purpose!  
  
**Caesar:**   
That was a good circus.  
My fans should be very pleased.  
  
**Caligula:**   
Is that it...? No...no!  
I need more screams... More desperation!  
  
＄94-04-77-65-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
We did it, Senpai! We won three battles in a row!  
You did an amazing job giving commands!  
  
**Erice:**   
This...this wasn't supposed to happen...  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Well, can't win 'em all!  
  
**El-Melloi II (Young):**  
Damn. I can't believe it's all over before  
I even got a chance to try anything.  
  
**Leonidas:**   
This would never have happened if  
I had gone out to meet the enemy!  
  
**Erice:**   
Great King? Chancellor? King of Sparta?  
Where are you going?  
  
**Erice:**   
Please...don't leave me...  
  
＄94-04-77-66-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
Let's just focus on winning one round at a time, Senpai. Awaiting your orders for the next round.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
She completely demolished us...

**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm so sorry. I was completely outmatched.

**Mash:**   
It's not your fault, Senpai. It's a shame things turned out this way, but we all did the best we could...  
  
＄94-04-77-68-1-0  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Well well! Not bad. Not bad at all.  
This will keep things interesting!  
  
**El-Melloi II (Young):**  
I'm glad somebody's enjoying this. Personally, I just want to get this little skirmish over with so I can do some sightseeing in Akihabara.  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Then perhaps I should go out there,  
and settle this once and for all?  
  
**El-Melloi II (Young):**  
Are you nuts!? If you went out there, you'd end up fanning  
the flames so far we'd never get them under control!  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Wa ha ha! You've got that right!  
  
**El-Melloi II (Young):**  
Ugh! For the life of me, I can't understand  
why you're so proud of that!  
  
**Erice:**   
I'm sorry, Great King and Sir Tactician,  
but I can't have you making decisions without my appro&ndash;  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Oh? I didn't think you had such little faith in me, Master.  
  
**El-Melloi II (Young):**  
Well, I can understand where you're coming from.  
  
**Erice:**   
Wait. I didn't mean it like&ndash;  
  
**Leonidas:**   
Hold it! Let me handle this. My muscles are especially  
well-suited for defensive battles!  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Done! I look forward to seeing you in action, General.  
  
**Leonidas:**   
Thank you, sir! You honor my muscles and my spear alike!  
Rest assured, this will be a battle for the ages!  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Marie:**   
Are you sure about this, Erice?  
You don't mind letting your Servants call their own shots?  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh?  
  
**Erice:**   
...If this is what they want, then I'll honor their wishes.  
Besides, I'm nothing more than a temporary Master to them.  
  
**Marie:**   
How very purehearted of you.  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh!?  
  
**Marie:**   
Personally, I think it's cute how you openly admire them.  
  
**Erice:**   
Th-thank you... I'm honored.  
  
**Marie:**   
Teehee. You really are precious, aren't you...  
  
**Marie:**   
So, what do you think, Fujimaru? Shall we send out  
our own vice commander, Arash, to meet him?  
  
**Arash:**   
Fine by me. I'm good to go at any time.  
  
**Edison:**   
Hold on now. Remember, our opponent this round is a Lancer.  
Do we really want to pit an Archer against him?  
  
**Arash:**   
The whole thing about heroes is, we don't run away from  
a fight. Not even one where the odds are against us.  
  
**Mash:**   
What do you think we should do, Senpai?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...All right. Let's go for it. But first...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm fine with it, but there's still one little problem...  
  
---  
  
**Arash:**   
Right. I'm not sure how we're gonna keep this guy in check...  
  
**Darius III:**   
Hnn... Grr!  
  
**Arash:**   
Oh well, things'll either work out, or they won't!  
  
**Edison:**   
Indeed! Don't worry, we'll handle things here!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Tch... Go on, get out there already.  
Just make sure you do your job.  
  
**Arash:**   
You got it!  
  
＄94-04-77-69-1-0  
  
**Leonidas:**   
Come on, take your best shot!  
My muscles can handle anything you throw at them!  
  
**Arash:**   
Is that so!? We'll just see about that!  
  
＄94-04-77-69-1-1  
  
**Leonidas:**   
How is this possible!? I ran the numbers! Several times! You should never have been able to get past me!  
  
**Arash:**   
No wall on Earth can stop a meteor in flight!  
  
＄94-04-77-69-1-5  
  
**Arash:**   
I have to admit...  
Your muscles were everything you said they'd be!  
  
**Leonidas:**   
And so my muscles have once again dominated the battlefield like walls of iron!  
  
＄94-04-77-70-1-0  
  
**Leonidas:**   
My muscles are the wall upon which your siege of our castle shall break!  
  
**Arash:**   
Try me! I'll punch through everything you've got like a shooting star!

**Mash:**   
Neither side is giving an inch, so now we're back to square one. I have to say, this is turning out to be just as epic a battle as you'd expect from pitting so many great heroes against each other.  
  
**Mash:**   
Still, I have faith that you'll ultimately lead us to victory, Senpai!  
  
＄94-04-77-72-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
We did it, Senpai! We won three battles in a row!  
  
**Erice:**   
No fair! That didn't count! It's not my fault I lost. If my tokens&ndash;my Servants hadn't gone off on their own&ndash;  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Stop that, Master. What's done is done; no amount  
of griping will change that. As our leader, it is  
incumbent upon you to accept your loss gracefully.  
  
**Erice:**   
...You're right, Great King. You're absolutely right.  
  
**El-Melloi II (Young):**  
Well, I can't say I don't have regrets. We could  
have gone in stronger right from the get-go. I  
guess there's not much difference between being  
overly cautious and plain old cowardice... Dammit!  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
＄94-04-77-73-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
We're building momentum, Senpai. Let's keep it up. Whatever happens, I know you'll make the right call!

**Mash:**   
It's not looking good for us, Senpai...

It's okay. We're still just getting started.

**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm sorry. I lost the game...

It's not your fault, Senpai. It's a shame things turned out this way, but we all did the best we could...

Ohoho! If the wild king of Persia wishes to face me, courtesy demands I answer his call!

Well fought! If this is what I have to look forward to the next time I'm summoned, I should have a grand old time!

Well, I'm glad one of us is happy about this! Ugh, I'm so done! I'm going to take a nice long break until we get back to Chaldea.

It would seem history has repeated itself, my old rival. Though this time, our clash is but a part of a larger whole.  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Maybe that will help you come to terms with this outcome, Darius. Rest in peace, and in the knowledge that you fought with honor.  
  
**El-Melloi II (Young):**  
He's really playing this up, isn't he... Oh well, as long as he's okay with it, I guess that's all that matters.  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh? What are you talking about?  
  
**El-Melloi II (Young):**  
Huh? Wait. You mean you still don't know?  
  
**El-Melloi II (Young):**  
Both Rider and I are just pieces in this game.  
And we're far from the only ones.

Our nations died out long ago, my old rival.  
  
**Iskandar:**   
But humanity, though it does face a host of problems, is still alive and well.  
  
**Iskandar:**   
Which means that we can now face each other not as kings, but as warriors, with nothing holding us back!

**Marie:**   
Now that the leader Servants on both sides are gone, we must get by with the remaining tokens we have.  
  
**Marie:**   
So, Erice, will I get to see what  
you can really do this time?  
  
**Erice:**   
...Yes, Queen Marie.  
I have nothing but the highest respect for you.  
  
**Erice:**   
So I promise to give you a fight you'll be proud of!  
  
**Hektor:**   
Hey, hey. Just so you know, this old man's already tuckered out, so he's gonna try to end this as soon as possible.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
While these patients are interesting...I'd be even more interested in studying your case, Master of Monde du Jeu.  
  
**Erice:**   
Do you...  
  
**Erice:**   
...Do you think there's something wrong with me, too?  
  
**Asclepius:**   
So, you're conscious of something being amiss. In that case, why not stand back and let me handle everything?  
  
**Erice:**   
No way. The problem is with the world, not me, and there's nothing a doctor can do about that. Not even the god of medicine.  
  
**Hektor:**   
Right on. So let's just slap a bandage on this place and move on. Anything more's too much trouble.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
I can't imagine a more slapdash approach.  
  
**Hektor:**   
Don't you think your approach is too damn confusing?  
  
**Hektor:**   
What do you want from this girl, anyway? Can't you tell she's scared and lost after wandering into this world and confronting her destiny?  
  
**Asclepius:**   
There's more to medicine than scalpels and prescriptions. Some sicknesses can be cured with no more than a sympathetic ear.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
From what I can tell, this looks to be such a case, but&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
Never mind that now!  
Just hurry up and take those people down!  
  
**Hektor:**   
Okay, you got it. This old man's gonna give it a whirl.  
  
**Mash:**   
We'd better get ready to face them, Senpai.  
Awaiting your orders!  
  
**Gilles:**   
Let justice be done, in the name of Saber Gilles de Rais. Bear witness to my triumph in this battle!  
  
＄94-04-77-85-1-0

This'd be a lot easier if you just surrendered...but if you won't, I guess I'll just have to wrap things up as quick as I can.

Good luck to you in the trials to come, Master.

Welp, this old man's gonna go  
home and sleep it off. Later!  
  
**Asclepius:**   
So it goes. Doubtless there will be many more cases to come that will require my personal attention.

Have I surrendered to the enemy...?  
No! This battle is not yet...

Phew, glad that's over with. All right, good luck with the rest. Make sure you get back to your original world soon.  
  
**Erice:**   
What do you mean by that?  
Are you encouraging me, or laughing at me?  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Just so you know, a patient's duty is to be  
honest and forthcoming with their doctor.  
  
**Asclepius:**   
Any foolish patient who isn't willing to do  
that is no more than a liability.

True, true. To expect great things of someone is basically to love them, and we all want to make our loved ones proud, don't we?  
  
**Circe:**   
Of course, just because we have expectations doesn't mean the expectee will live up to them...but that's no excuse not to try.  
  
**Circe:**   
Far as I'm concerned, having such inflated expectations of someone that you end up regretting it isn't love at all.  
  
**Circe:**   
So instead of tiring yourself out by bottling all your feelings up and worrying about everyone else, I say just be vocal about your real love!  
  
**Circe:**   
And in my opinion, the best way to do that is to turn them into animals and shower them with affection.  
  
**Medea:**   
Um, Auntie? Do you think you could finish  
your philosophical treatise later?  
  
**Circe:**   
Hey, what've I told you about calling me “Ms. Circe”?  
  
**Circe:**   
Hmm? Hang on. I wonder if I could tell this Erice girl I'm actually YOUR niece and get away with it...  
  
**Erice:**   
Um... I'm sorry to tell you this, Circe the Witch, but I already met you in Akihabara, so...  
  
**Circe:**   
That's Queen Witch, dammit!  
Aw, phooey.  
  
**Medea:**   
Okay, that's enough of that.  
Let's get started, Ms. Auntie!  
  
**Mash:**   
Now that that, um, halftime show is over...we're about  
to begin the battle, Senpai. Awaiting your orders!  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Is that bizarre little skit over now? Then allow me to put on a romantic performance of my own.  
  
＄94-04-77-94-1-0  
  
**Circe:**   
Well, I'll be. I'm amazed you've got the  
guts and the talent to challenge me!  
  
**Circe:**   
I'll have to do something special for you!  
How does a bottomless kykeon coupon sound?  
  
**Medea:**   
How is that any different from usual?  
  
**Circe:**   
Hey, there are plenty of variations to go around!  
Like dessert kykeon! Or Japanese-style kykeon!  
  
＄94-04-77-94-1-1  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Glory to the French Royal Family, and to my Master!  
  
**Medea:**   
So not only did we lose miserably, we're basically victory prizes, too? I guess the only good part is that this happened in another world, where there won't be so many witnesses to this humiliation...  
  
**Circe:**   
Personally, I didn't mind so much...  
  
＄94-04-77-94-1-5  
  
**d'Eon:**   
I suppose every lily must eventually be plucked...  
  
**Medea:**   
Happy now, cheeky Monde du Jeu Master?  
  
**Erice:**   
Very. You have my gratitude, most legendary and admirable witch of myth.  
  
**Circe:**   
Before we go, let me give you a word of advice, Queen Witch to temporary Master: there's no light to be found in the place you seek to return to.  
  
**Circe:**   
Be careful not to get so overwhelmed by what's happening now that you wind up in the wrong place.  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh!? What do you mean by that!?  
  
**Circe:**   
I'm not just gonna give you the answer.  
You gotta figure it out for yourself.  
  
＄94-04-77-95-1-0  
  
**Medea:**   
I do wish Auntie would learn to dial it down a little since she's Hecate's number one apprentice and all...  
  
**Circe:**   
Hey, can't you do that in private!? I'll have you know I'm very sensitive to that kind of reaction!  
  
＄94-04-77-95-1-1  
  
**d'Eon:**   
Glory to the French Royal Family, and to my Master!  
  
**Medea:**   
So not only did we lose miserably, we're basically victory prizes, too? I guess the only good part is that this happened in another world, where there won't be so many witnesses to this humiliation...

You gotta figure it out for yourself.  
  
＄94-04-77-96-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
We did it, Senpai! We won!  
And it's all thanks to your brilliant orders!  
  
**Edison:**   
Five wins to two losses, eh. Not bad at all. But then, I shouldn't be surprised our Master would come through.  
  
**Erice:**   
...Fujimaru isn't anything special. It was  
all the Servants. They're the incredible ones.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
It doesn't matter how good a weapon is if it has a shit wielder.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Speaking of which, what about you? How's it feel to have had all those amazing heroes at your disposal and still lose so miserably?  
  
**Mash:**   
(That was harsh, even for Emiya!)  
  
**Erice:**   
...Yes, you're right. I'm still a rank amateur.  
I admit it.  
  
**Voyager:**   
You're not weak, Erice.  
  
**Erice:**   
...Stop it.  
  
**Voyager:**   
You're not weak, Erice.  
You're just alone. That's why&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
I said stop it, Voyager!  
I mean it. I don't want to hear another word!  
  
＄94-04-77-97-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...She utterly destroyed us.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can't believe how badly we lost...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I know. I'm so sorry, Senpai...  
  
＄94-04-77-98-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
We did it, Senpai! We won three battles in a row!  
  
**Erice:**   
I don't believe it. How did [♂ he /♀️ she] manage to  
fend off the Queen Witch and her apprentice?  
  
＄94-04-77-99-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
We're almost there, Senpai!  
  
＄94-04-78-00-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
There's no more room for error, Senpai!  
We have to win the remaining battles!  
  
＄94-04-78-01-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I guess I just couldn't turn the tide.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory is the worst.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I know. I am so frustrated right now!  
  
＄94-04-78-02-1-0  
  
**Erice:**   
Now what do I do?  
Who should I bring out next...?  
  
**Erice:**   
Agamemnon?  
...No. He'll just fly off the rails.  
  
**Erice:**   
Hannibal? ...No, he won't be much  
help with a small-scale skirmish.  
  
**Erice:**   
All right, in that case...  
  
**Erice:**   
This combination ought to do it!  
  
**D：Artemis:**   
Yay♪  
Look, darling, we get to go on a date♪  
  
**D：Orion:**   
Man, nothing ever gets you down, does it?  
Meanwhile, our Monde du Jeu Master's worried sick.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Not to worry, Monde du Jeu Master. I assure you that I will compensate for any weaknesses my comrade may have.  
  
**Chiron:**   
Though that hardly seems necessary,  
given who you've chosen.  
  
**Erice:**   
Thank you, O teacher of many great heroes.  
Please...! Help me find the path to victory!  
  
**Mash:**   
...It looks like Erice is getting pretty rattled.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Looks that way. But we haven't won yet.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'll still have to be careful not todrop our guard until this is over.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai.  
I'll aid you as best I can!  
  
**Voyager:**   
Wow. A centaur...  
  
**Jeanne:**   
He's a very wise sage, for sure. He taught many of the greatest heroes of all time. Even so, child, I think there's something you can learn from me.  
  
**Voyager:**   
You're...a saint, right?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
That's right. And I know better than most how to keep moving ahead, no matter what.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Okay. I'll watch you... And I won't forget...  
  
＄94-04-78-03-1-0  
  
**Artemis:**   
Ahahahaha♪ Upsy-daisyyy!  
  
**Orion:**   
  
Cut! That! Out! I told you, I'm not a toy! Aaah!  
  
**Chiron:**   
Oho, interesting. So your strategy is to make your own body a target, thereby drawing the enemy's attention. I can see why you were considered superhuman.  
  
**Orion:**   
Stop encouraging her, dammit!  
  
＄94-04-78-03-1-1  
  
**Jeanne:**   
All right, child, it's your turn now.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Got it!  
  
**Artemis:**   
Aww, we lost. This is sooo frustrating.  
Will you cheer me up, darling?  
  
**Orion:**   
Whoop, sorry! I've gotta hurry up and get ready  
for my next job! Maybe next time, Artie!  
  
**Chiron:**   
...I think I had best be on my way as well. Besides, you know what they say about putting the cart before the horse.  
  
＄94-04-78-03-1-5  
  
**Jeanne:**   
I may have been defeated, but the battlefield remains in flux, and the battle itself continues on. And so I ask you, child, to carry on Master's flag in my stead.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Okay. I will!  
  
**Artemis:**   
Hurray, we won spectacularly♪  
Don't you think I deserve a reward, darling♪  
  
**Orion:**   
Oh, yeah, sure. Later.  
  
**Artemis:**   
Oh no you don't! I want one riiight now!  
  
**Orion:**   
Wah!? H-hey, stop!  
You can't give a bear a bear hug!  
  
**Chiron:**   
Well, Monde du Jeu Master, though I must be on my way now, I hope you will continue to learn and grow in my absence.  
  
**Erice:**   
I will, Chiron. Take care.  
  
＄94-04-78-04-1-0  
  
**Chiron:**   
It seems our opponent is quite skilled as well. I would suggest a strategy that could give us an advantage, but&ndash;  
  
**Orion:**   
Yeah, don't bother.  
Strategies aren't exactly her strong suit.  
  
**Artemis:**   
So? I'm perfectly happy keeping  
our world to just the two of us♪  
  
**Orion:**   
You really are hopeless, you know that!?  
Ugh, just do whatever it is you're gonna do already!  
  
**Artemis:**   
'Kaaay♪  
  
＄94-04-78-04-1-1  
  
**Jeanne:**   
All right, child, it's your turn now.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Got it!  
  
**Artemis:**   
Aww, we lost. This is sooo frustrating.  
Will you cheer me up, darling?  
  
**Orion:**   
Whoop, sorry! I've gotta hurry up and get ready  
for my next job! Maybe next time, Artie!

＄94-04-78-04-1-5  
  
**Jeanne:**   
I may have lost, but the battle is not yet over. And so I ask you, child, to carry Master's flag in my stead.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Okay. I will!  
  
**Artemis:**   
Hooray! What a spectacular victory♪  
Don't you think I deserve a reward, darling?♪  
  
**Orion:**   
Oh, yeah, sure. Later.  
  
**Artemis:**   
Oh no you don't! I want one riiight now!  
  
**Orion:**   
Wah!? H-hey, stop!  
You can't bear-hug a bear!  
  
**Chiron:**   
Well, Monde du Jeu Master, though we must be on our way now, I hope that even in my absence, you will continue to learn and grow.  
  
**Erice:**   
I will, Sage Chiron. Take care.  
  
＄94-04-78-05-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
We did it, Senpai! We won!  
And it's all thanks to your orders!  
  
**Edison:**   
Five wins, three losses, hmm. It was close, but we pulled through. I knew our Master would come through for us.  
  
**Erice:**   
...Fujimaru isn't anything special.  
You Servants are.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Yeah, you might be right.  
But then, what's that say about you?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
The fact is, you had some amazing heroes at your disposal, and you still got your ass handed to you.  
  
**Erice:**   
...Yes, you're right. I'm still a rank amateur.  
I admit it.  
  
**Voyager:**   
That's not true.  
  
**Erice:**   
Voyager...  
  
**Voyager:**   
You're not weak, Erice.  
You're just alone. That's why&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
Stop it, Voyager. That's enough.  
I don't want to hear another word!  
  
＄94-04-78-06-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Dammit... We were so close.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm sorry. I tripped right at the finish line.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I know, we really were close. It's such a shame. But I don't think you or anyone else did anything wrong. Sometimes, luck just isn't on your side...  
  
＄94-04-78-07-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
We did it, Senpai! We won three battles in a row!  
  
**Erice:**   
I can't believe it. Not even Chiron's wisdom, or the virgin goddess's arrows, were enough to stop them...  
  
＄94-04-78-08-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
This is it, Senpai.  
We're about to begin the final round!  
  
**Erice:**   
You've got to be kidding me.  
How did it get this close!?  
  
＄94-04-78-09-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I just couldn't hold on to our lead.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What can I say? She beat us fair and square!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
True, our opponent was very formidable. I thought we'd be able to hold our ground, but she went on the offensive and we just couldn't stop her...  
  
＄94-04-78-10-1-0  
  
**Erice:**   
For the final stage, I will call upon the very embodiment of justice!  
  
**Astraea:**   
I have heard your call, and I shall grant your request.  
  
**Mash:**   
Astraea! I suppose the Greek goddess of  
justice would certainly fit the bill.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I've seen enough battlefields to know that justice comes in many forms.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
At this point, it doesn't matter who we're up against.We'll take them down no matter what!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai!  
We definitely can't afford to lose now!  
  
＄94-04-78-11-1-0  
  
**Astraea:**   
My, you've certainly collected a lot of tokens, haven't you? Don't you think you're being a bit greedy?  
  
**Astraea:**   
Very well then, I'll use my scales to even the  
odds so that we may have a truly fair fight!  
  
**Mash:**   
Aah! Astraea has all our tokens now!  
  
**Astraea:**   
There we go. Now both sides are evenly matched,  
and we're ready to have a great fight!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What do you mean!? I can't fight like this!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How!? I don't have anyone left to fight with!  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
The goddess of judgment is never wrong.  
This is all part of the Monde du Jeu's rules.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Rules, huh.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
So if the one making the rules is taking part herself, what's to stop her from bending those rules as she likes?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
If you ask me, the only way to ensure the game's actually balanced is for her to stay out of it.  
  
**Erice:**   
Forget it. Not happening.  
  
**Astraea:**   
My Monde du Jeu Master there is right. This is the fairest, and by extension, most just way for us to play.  
  
**Astraea:**   
Also, for the record, Fujimaru, it is only now  
that you have lost nearly all your tokens that your side and ours are finally on even ground.  
  
**Astraea:**   
I swear to the truth of this statement upon Lady Justice's own scales.  
  
**Mash:**   
So...you're saying we have enough strength on our side even without our tokens?  
  
**Astraea:**   
That's right, and it is why this decision is a just one.  
  
**Edison:**   
I object in the strongest possible terms! And I'm more  
than willing to take this dispute to court if necessary!  
  
**Marie:**   
While that does sound like it would be quite a spectacle...I can't say I have many fond memories of courtrooms.  
  
**Erice:**   
I see... I understand, Queen Marie. I apologize on behalf of the inventor king for his nonsensical suggestion.  
  
**Edison:**   
Well, I'm not going to apologize!  
I've not yet begun to fight!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That would take forever.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Even if I wanted to hold a trial, I don't have an attorney to defend me.  
  
---  
  
**Edison:**   
Don't worry! I'm prepared to fight this all the way to the top, even if I have to do so alone for the rest of my life!  
  
**Marie:**   
(Yawwwn)... This is getting boring.  
Would you mind if I took a little nap?  
  
**Erice:**   
I'll end this soon, Your Majesty.  
I don't have time to waste here, anyway.  
  
**Erice:**   
If you don't have any more tokens you can use,  
Fujimaru, you can just fight yourself.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, yeah. I guess I could, couldn't I?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Talk about a last resort!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai?  
I mean, Master!?  
  
**Voyager:**   
I'll fight.  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh? Voyager...?  
  
**Mash:**   
Ah... Right. That's right.  
  
**Mash:**   
Voyager, Senpai, and I have all been  
facing Monde du Jeu's games together.  
  
**Mash:**   
Maybe the player has to fight if they  
don't have any tokens, but Voyager&ndash;  
  
**Voyager:**   
It's all...part of the game.  
I can fight...can't I, Erice?  
  
**Erice:**   
Are you serious, Voyager?  
But, you're my&ndash;  
  
**Voyager:**   
Yes, I'm your Servant, and you're my Master.  
We're...fated friends.  
  
**Voyager:**   
But right now, I'm your opponent in this game.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I want to help you, Erice. So I'm gonna fight.  
  
**Erice:**   
Khh...  
  
**Erice:**   
...Astraea! Fair and impartial goddess of justice! I beg you, pass judgment on him, so that he might listen to reason!  
  
**Astraea:**   
Very well. Then I will commence my attack!  
  
＄94-04-78-11-1-1  
  
**Astraea:**   
Well fought!  
Here are your tokens back.  
  
**Astraea:**   
I have made my ruling. Justice has been served. I am now yours to command as you see fit, Fujimaru.  
May justice smile upon you!  
  
**Erice:**   
N-no way...  
  
**Mash:**   
It's been a long match, Senpai, but we did it!  
We won the final round and the game!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Hmph. About time.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Did you start pulling your punches halfway through, Master? You've always been soft when it's time to go in for the kill.  
  
**Edison:**   
It was indeed a close match, but you held on admirably! My heart is positively pounding!  
  
**Marie:**   
That was so much fun♪  
  
**Erice:**   
Dammit. How did this happen?  
  
＄94-04-78-11-1-5  
  
**Astraea:**   
Well fought!  
Here are your tokens back.  
  
**Astraea:**   
I have made my ruling. Justice has been served. The winner is Erice Utsumi! May her name be praised far and wide!  
  
**Erice:**   
Thank you, O goddess of justice. I will think of you whenever I gaze up at the constellations in the night sky.  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We came really close, didn't we?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We almost had it, and we let it slip through our fingers...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I know...  
  
**Marie:**   
Well, speaking as a spectator, I thought it was an absolutely delightful battle. Great work, Fujimaru♪  
  
**Marie:**   
I also found myself on pins and needles  
watching you fight, Erice.  
  
**Erice:**   
Oh. I, uh... Th-thank you...  
  
**Marie:**   
Teehee, you really are adorable. You're more delicate than a pastry, and softer than a madeleine.  
  
**Marie:**   
But you also have traces of something bitter,  
like dark roasted coffee.

**Salieri:**   
Swift justice? Don't make me laugh. You're just playing the same perfectly tuned melody you always use when you pass judgment.  
  
**Salieri:**   
Let me be clear: I refute, reject, repudiate,  
and rebut your so-called justice in any and all forms!  
  
**Erice:**   
Khh...!  
  
**Erice:**   
This isn't just about me. This is about whether  
or not all of Monde du Jeu deserves to exist.  
  
**Erice:**   
Please, goddess. Let your righteous judgment shine forth.  
  
**Astraea:**   
Oh, I will. I swear it on my arms, my legs, my back, my abs, and every bit of fighting spirit within my body.  
  
**Astraea:**   
Now, have at you!  
  
＄94-04-78-12-1-1  
  
**Salieri:**   
I prevailed over this perverse so-called justice, Master. All that remains now is for you to follow the path you believe in.  
  
**Astraea:**   
I have made my ruling. Justice has been served. I am now yours to command as you see fit, Fujimaru.  
May justice smile upon you!  
  
**Erice:**   
N-no way...  
  
**Mash:**   
It's been a long match, Senpai, but we did it!  
We won the final round and the game!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Hmph. About time.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Did you start pulling your punches halfway through, Master? You've always been soft when it's time to go in for the kill.  
  
**Edison:**   
It was indeed a close match, but you held on admirably! My heart is positively pounding!  
  
**Marie:**   
That was so much fun♪  
  
**Erice:**   
Dammit. How did this happen?  
  
＄94-04-78-12-1-5  
  
**Salieri:**   
I see... It seems that society, presenting itself as justice, has defeated me once again...!  
  
**Astraea:**   
I have made my ruling. Justice has been served. The winner is Erice Utsumi! May her name be praised far and wide!  
  
**Erice:**   
Thank you, O goddess of justice. I will think of you whenever I gaze up at the constellations in the night sky.  
  
**Mash:**   
Be careful, Senpai.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We came really close, didn't we?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We almost had it, and we let it slip through our fingers...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I know...  
  
**Marie:**   
Well, speaking as a spectator, I thought it was an absolutely delightful battle. Great work, Fujimaru♪  
  
**Marie:**   
I also found myself on pins and needles  
watching you fight, Erice.  
  
**Erice:**   
Oh. I, uh... Th-thank you...  
  
**Marie:**   
Teehee, you really are adorable. You're more delicate than a pastry, and softer than a madeleine.  
  
**Marie:**   
But you also have traces of something bitter,  
like dark roasted coffee.  
  
＄94-04-78-13-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
Wow! All the tokens you won are  
back in your hands, Senpai!  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Voyager:**   
Please, Erice, everything's done.  
Let's just go home, together.  
  
**Erice:**   
Go home? Where?  
  
**Erice:**   
We're just like these tokenized Heroic Spirits. We can't leave this world until our work here is done.  
  
**Voyager:**   
But you lost, Erice.  
  
**Erice:**   
...This isn't over yet.  
There's still one last game left to play!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
True. My notes say there were five  
mysterious games in total.  
  
**Edison:**   
Indeed. And this was only the fourth.  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh goody♪ I can't wait to have some more fun.  
  
**Mash:**   
I thought we'd already won... If there's still another game to play, then who's going to be our opponent?  
  
**Mash:**   
Look, Senpai, there's a tram headed our way.  
I think it's about to leave for the next game.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Are we...going?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course! Come on, Erice.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You bet. Come with us, Erice.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh? Wha!?  
  
**Voyager:**   
I see. I'd like that.  
  
**Erice:**   
Are you nuts!? We're enemies! Even if I wanted to be friends, it would never happen until we've settled our score!  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice...please don't say that.  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes, we are still fighting.  
But only as part of this game.  
  
**Mash:**   
We're not really your enemies, Erice.  
Senpai's just another player.  
  
**Erice:**   
I know! I know that, but...  
Khh!  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice! Wait!  
  
＄94-04-78-14-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
All the tokens are going over to Erice...  
  
**Erice:**   
This game of ours might be over now, but...  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice?  
  
**Erice:**   
This is where we go our separate ways.  
  
**Erice:**   
There's another tram leaving.  
The next game is waiting for me up ahead.  
  
**Erice:**   
Not that it matters to you guys anymore.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice! Aren't you going to take me with you!?  
  
**Erice:**   
If you still want to play, then wait for the next tram. Though I can't promise it'll be headed the same way.  
  
**Mash:**   
Is that&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You mean we have another chance to challenge you?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Assuming you can catch up to me again.  
  
＄94-04-78-15-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
Wow! All the tokens you won are back in your hands, Senpai!  
  
**Mash:**   
Now that the battle is over,  
we can see everyone who temporarily disappeared again.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That kind of thing happens a lot with Servants.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe that's part of the game rules, too.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Erice:**   
You guys might've won this round, but this isn't  
over yet. There's still one more game left.  
  
**Mash:**   
There's a tram headed our way.  
It looks like it's time to head to the next city.  
  
**Voyager:**   
We're finally together again, Erice.  
  
**Erice:**   
Wh-who said you could just talk to  
me whenever you feel like it!?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice...  
  
**Erice:**   
We... We're not a team right now.  
  
**Erice:**   
But I WILL get you back. I promise.  
  
**Erice:**   
So in the meantime, we have to keep our distance.  
  
**Voyager:**   
No. I don't want to.  
  
**Voyager:**   
You're my friend, Erice.  
I want to be with you.  
  
**Voyager:**   
That's why I came here.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I want us all to&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
But...that doesn't&ndash;  
  
**Marie:**   
You two are very close, aren't you?  
  
**Erice:**   
Queen Marie?  
  
**Marie:**   
I used to be close to someone like that.  
Someone very precious, who's no longer with us...  
  
**Edison:**   
Ah yes, your childhood friend who turned into a werewolf. It's a great shame, what happened to him.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
He died protecting someone he cared for, huh.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
...  
  
**Marie:**   
No, never mind him.  
I was thinking about someone else.  
  
**Marie:**   
Someone a lot like Voyager...  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Erice:**   
...I need to go.  
The next game's about to begin.  
  
＄94-04-78-16-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
All the tokens are going over to Erice...  
  
**Erice:**   
This game of ours might be over now, but...  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice?  
  
**Erice:**   
This is where we go our separate ways.  
  
**Erice:**   
There's another tram leaving.  
The next game is waiting for me up ahead.  
  
**Erice:**   
Not that it matters to you guys anymore.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice! Aren't you going to take me with you!?  
  
**Erice:**   
If you still want to play, then wait for the next tram.  
Though I can't promise it'll be headed the same way.  
  
**Mash:**   
I...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You mean we have another chance to challenge you?

**Erice:**   
Assuming you can catch up to me again.  
  
＄94-04-78-17-1-0  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I see, I see.  
Sounds like this Erice girl's got a lot going on.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
So she and Voyager used to be Master and Servant  
back in their original world...  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
...but she lost her Command Spells in Monde du Jeu,  
and is now fighting as a Rogue Servant.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
And what's more, she still doesn't  
even realize she is a Servant, huh.  
  
**Mash:**   
Um, Da Vinci, could you please keep your voice down?  
I think it's better if we don't rile her up...  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Why's that? This could be your chance to finally hash things out. Open, honest conversation's the first step on the road to mutual understanding, after all.  
  
**Mash:**   
Maybe so, but I think there are also some things people just aren't ready to hear, no matter how they're delivered.  
  
**Mash:**   
It feels like her heart is completely closed off... Maybe even trapped, in a way.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Hmm, hmm. You do make a good point.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Okay then, just to make sure: I'm guessing  
it's her past that's dominating her heart?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...but she lost her Command Spells in Monde du Jeu,  
and is now fighting as a Rogue Servant.

And what's more, she still doesn't  
even realize she is a Servant, huh.

Hmm, hmm. You do make a good point.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Okay then, just to make sure: I'm guessing  
it's her past that's dominating her heart?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Not her past. Her...now.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice wants to get back a world where she can be herself.  
  
**Edison:**   
I see. That must be the world we caught a glimpse of in Akihabara, though with real people instead of Meeple.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
A world where everyone's got a Holy Grail and a bond with a Servant, huh? Sounds pretty wild in its own right.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
So that's where you and Erice are from.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Uh-huh.  
  
**Marie:**   
...I see. Then if anyone here is trapped by their past, it's me. Sometimes I still see the face of the precious child I lost in my dreams.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
You mean Louis XVII?  
  
**Marie:**   
Yes. Oh, my poor little Charles.  
  
**Erice:**   
(Louis...)  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Dauphin Louis Charles. He was meant to be the seventeenth ruler of France, but he died miserably when he was only ten years old.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
If his Spirit Origin was inscribed in the Throne of Heroes, he'd probably be an Avenger if he was ever summoned.

**Erice:**   
Khh...!  
  
**Marie:**   
Maybe we shouldn't talk about this anymore.  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Marie:**   
I can tell Erice has someone she cares very much about.  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**Mash:**   
Right. And as if losing something precious to her weren't enough, she's also been caught up in an incomprehensible situation, and she's doing everything she can to make the best of it.  
  
**Voyager:**   
It's the same for me.  
I want to help Erice.  
  
**Voyager:**   
That's why I came here with all of you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's why we're playing these games.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm sure one of our dice rolls will be the key thatunlocks the door forward! ...At least, I hope so.  
  
---  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Hmm. So you're trying to get Erice to open  
up by fighting as hard as you can, huh?  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Haha, that's so you.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
All right, Fujimaru, if that's what you  
think is best, then you go for it.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
And may Lady Luck smile on your dice!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm. So you're trying to get Erice to open  
up by fighting as hard as you can, huh?

**Da Vinci:**   
And may Lady Luck smile on your dice!  
  
**Edison:**   
It looks like we've arrived at the next stage.  
  
**Marie:**   
I wonder what kind of revue I'll get to see this time♪  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
...  
  
＄94-04-78-17-2-0  
  
**Mash:**   
No sooner did we get off the train than we found ourselves on a desolate mountain...  
  
**Marie:**   
Desolate is a good word for it. I don't know why,  
but it feels kind of hostile here...  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
There's a reason for that.  
Look, over there. And right here, too.  
  
**???:**  
  
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
All the local ghosts are coming out of the woodwork.  
  
**Mash:**   
We're surrounded, Senpai!  
What are your or&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
Relax. They might be creepy,  
but they're not going to hurt you.  
  
**Mash:**   
How can you tell, Erice?  
  
**Erice:**   
Because I'm a player.  
Just like you, Fujimaru.  
  
**Erice:**   
Everyone brought into Monde du Jeu falls into one of two categories: those who are incorporated into this world, and those who aren't.  
  
**Erice:**   
You and I are part of the latter group...  
  
**Erice:**   
...so our minds weren't stolen from us,  
like the Servants' were.  
  
**Erice:**   
We still have wills of our own,  
and we can choose to play&ndash;to fight here.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So, are you saying I have a part to play in this world, too?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You mean, there's something I'm meant to do here, too?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
That's right. You and I aren't like everyone else.  
And the reason for that...  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**Erice:**   
...was probably you.  
  
**Erice:**   
Those guys there are just here for atmosphere.  
They can't do anything of their own volition.  
  
**Erice:**   
The only move they will ever make is one allowed by the rules.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
So why not just smash that rule to pieces?  
  
**Erice:**   
That's the whole reason I've been fighting:  
  
**Erice:**   
To destroy this world and take back what I lost.  
  
**Erice:**   
I was planning to accomplish that goal all on my own...  
  
**Erice:**   
But now, I think that competing with you guys might  
not be a bad way of going about it, either.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So what's this new game entail?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So how do we win this new game?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
You know, you've been weirdly hyped about this from the beginning. Are you actually enjoying this? If you are, you're made of way sterner stuff than I am.  
  
**Erice:**   
...As for how we win, I'm guessing this game's a race. And our goal...  
  
**Erice:**   
...is that shrine you can see on top of the mountain, past the trail.  
  
**Voyager:**   
A race?  
  
**Erice:**   
Yup. But one we run with dice instead of on foot.  
An old-fashioned board game, basically.  
  
**Erice:**   
You know, board games are one of the world's oldest forms of entertainment. They go all the way back to ancient Egypt.  
  
**Erice:**   
That game was all about death and rebirth, which is  
something ancient Egyptians cared about more than anything.  
  
**Erice:**   
That's right, the world's first board game was about passing through the afterlife and emerging in a new world of life.  
  
**Erice:**   
This is the fifth game...  
It might be an appropriate one to wrap this up.  
  
**Erice:**   
Do you know anything about these kinds of board games, Voyager?  
  
**Voyager:**   
You roll dice in them right?  
  
**Erice:**   
Yeah, you roll them a ton. As long as you know that, you should be okay. Why don't you give it a shot?  
  
**Voyager:**   
I know how. See?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You guys really are good friends, aren't you?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(I think that's the first time I've seen Erice smile...)  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Never mind that!  
Just hurry up and gather around Voyager already!  
  
**Erice:**   
After all, he's YOUR game piece right now!  
Okay, Fujimaru, let's play!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What the!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Did we just teleport!?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
We just moved approximately seven hundred meters!  
I can't see Erice anywhere anymore!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Damn, so we really are playing a board game.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I guess this means one square on the boardis about a hundred meters then?  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
This is fun. It's so fast.  
  
**Edison:**   
Are we all present and accounted for?  
Anyone left behind?  
  
**Marie:**   
Just Erice. Everyone else is here.  
  
**Mash:**   
Then she must have let us take the first turn.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Hey. Looks like we've got company.  
  
**Benkei:**   
Haaalt! None shall pass!  
  
**Benkei:**   
If you insist on attempting to do so,  
then you shall have to defeat me first!  
  
**Mash:**   
Benkei!?  
Does this mean you guard this square?  
  
**Mash:**   
So what happens to us if we fail to defeat you?  
  
**Benkei:**   
Worry not; your lives will be spared.  
But you will need to sit out the next turn.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So we'll probably have to face something like this on every square, huh.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
All right, I see how this works.  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
Out of the way! I mean it now!  
  
＄94-04-78-17-2-1  
  
**Mash:**   
We did it, Senpai!  
We managed to defeat Benkei!  
  
**Marie:**   
I guess these guardians don't turn  
into tokens when they lose, huh?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Must mean they're part of the game. Not sure they even qualify as Servants in that case.  
  
**Edison:**   
Look, over there!  
A flash of light in the direction we came from!  
  
**Erice:**   
Hmm. So that's how that works.  
  
**Erice:**   
It looks like players can hear each other and see how the game is playing out. Well, that makes sense. There wouldn't be much tension otherwise.  
  
＄94-04-78-17-2-5  
  
**Benkei:**   
#### Is that it!? Do better!  
  
**Mash:**   
He really isn't going to let us by...  
  
**Edison:**   
Look, over there!  
A flash of light in the direction we came from!  
  
**Voyager:**   
It must be Erice.  
I'm going to roll the dice again.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Huh? I can't seem to do it...  
  
**Edison:**   
Erice just rolled her dice a second time!  
  
**Erice:**   
Not a great roll, but it looks like things worked out.  
  
**Erice:**   
Players can hear each other, and see how the game is playing out. I guess there wouldn't be much tension otherwise.  
  
＄94-04-78-17-3-0  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice just appeared about a hundred meters ahead of us!  
  
**???:**  
  
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)  
  
**Mash:**   
There's an enemy in front of her! Maybe that square's guardian was waiting to ambush whoever landed there?  
  
**Edison:**   
It does look that way. But it's odd They seem weirdly...indistinct, for a Servant.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Must be a shadow, a figure that wasn't able to become a full-fledged Servant.  
  
**Erice:**   
Do you really think you have a chance against me?  
  
**Erice:**   
Or...are you drawn to me because I'm, well, me?  
Do my evil spirits attract ghosts like you?  
  
**Mash:**   
Evil spirits?  
  
**Erice:**   
Begone, wicked spirit!  
  
**???:**  
  
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)  
  
**Mash:**   
Wow, she's strong! Erice just defeated  
that Shadow Servant with a single kick!  
  
**Marie:**   
So this is how we make our way to the goal, huh? That shrine on the peak looks to be some kind of sacred ground...  
  
**Marie:**   
Is there something special up there?  
Maybe some kind of hidden treasure?  
  
**Erice:**   
No, Queen Marie, there's nothing there that you would consider treasure. Besides, you should already know what it is.  
  
**Marie:**   
I should? What do you mean?  
  
**Erice:**   
You poor thing. Chaldea must have taken everything from you. Your will, your memories, your drive, your pride...  
  
**Erice:**   
But I'm not like that. I have a will of my own, and the power&ndash;wicked though it might be&ndash;to see it realized. I can fight all on my own.  
  
**Erice:**   
And I'm going to get back everything I lost.  
Just you wait.  
  
**Erice:**   
There's another dear friend of mine waiting  
for me up there. I'm sure of it.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Dear friend...?  
  
**Erice:**   
All right, Fujimaru, let's get back to the game.  
Go on, roll the dice.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh, yeah, I will, but...do you think maybe we could talk first?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okay, but...are you sure you don't have something you want to say?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Forget it. There's no point.  
Now hurry up and take your turn!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...All right. Voyager?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okay, if you insist. Go for it, Voyager.  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
Okay.  
  
＄94-04-78-18-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
We just teleported again!  
We're pulling away!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Maybe not. There's another guardian waiting for us.  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
I'm sorry...but I have to be your opponent.  
No hard feelings.  
  
＄94-04-78-18-1-1  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai, we've defeated Kotarou!  
  
**Voyager:**   
Where's Erice?  
  
**Erice:**   
Did you really think you could leave me behind?  
  
＄94-04-78-18-1-5  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
My apologies for this, once again. Consider it a chance to rest. Please, make yourselves at home until it's time for you to continue.  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh my. It seems Erice is taking her time, too.  
  
**Voyager:**   
We have to take a break...  
  
**Erice:**   
I was a little nervous when you guys pulled away,  
but you actually waited for me?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Not exactly...  
  
＄94-04-78-18-2-0  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice just appeared about a hundred meters behind us. She's staying right on our tail.  
  
**???:**  
  
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)  
  
**Erice:**   
...They're acting according to the game's rules. That's why they're attacking me: they've completely accepted their role.  
  
**Erice:**   
I used to be just like them. I felt like being the Grim Reaper gave my life meaning.  
  
**Erice:**   
At least until I met you, Voyager.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice...  
  
＄94-04-78-19-1-0  
  
**Erice:**   
Voyager, you might be my Servant&ndash;or at least,  
you used to be&ndash;but you weren't my first friend.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Oh, right. I remember. When I met you...you had a really, really big friend.  
  
**Mash:**   
I see. So Voyager wasn't your only friend then.  
  
**Erice:**   
That's right. I really looked up to them. They were kind, dependable, and they had a lot of integrity...  
  
**Erice:**   
And now, I have to save them.  
  
**Erice:**   
All right, it's your turn now, Voyager.  
Let's hurry this up so we can finish the game.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Okay. I will!  
  
**Edison:**   
We're almost to the halfway point. Stay sharp;  
we've still got a long road ahead of us.  
  
**Marie:**   
Do you think the trail keeps going past that gate?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
If you're worrying about hoofing it up the mountain...don't. Getting there's the easy part.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
What I'm worried about is whoever's  
waiting for us at the goal.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I know who. Erice's friend.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She has a friend in this world?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And they're waiting at the goal? I've got a bad feeling about this...  
  
---  
  
**Suzuka Gozen:**   
Ugh, do you dorks, like, ever shut up?  
  
**Suzuka Gozen:**   
You know, this might not be my Mt. Suzuka, but for some reason my Spirit Origin is totes at home here.  
  
**Suzuka Gozen:**   
So hey, since you dweebs, like, managed to make it up to the middle of Togakushi, how 'bout you kick back and...chillax with me for a while?  
  
＄94-04-78-19-1-1  
  
**Mash:**   
We did it! We defeated Suzuka Gozen!  
  
**Mash:**   
You know, between Benkei, Kotarou, and Suzuka, there seems to be a distinct theme to our opponents...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You mean, the fact that they're all Japanese Servants?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That probably means the final boss of this area'll fit the pattern, too.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I heard her mention “Togakushi.”  
Could that be the name of the mountain?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Yup, it is. Mt. Togakushi's home to both Shugendou practitioners and ninja, both of which are going to be a serious pain to deal with.  
  
**Edison:**   
Damn, and Erice just pulled ahead by rolling a twelve!  
  
＄94-04-78-19-1-5  
  
**Suzuka Gozen:**   
Aww, sucks to suck.  
Don't let it, like, get you down though, yeah?  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice just rolled her dice.  
We're still ahead of her for now, but...  
  
**Edison:**   
Khh, I can't believe we're stuck  
here for the next round!  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
Heh... Not bad.  
  
＄94-04-78-19-2-0  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice just appeared six hundred meters ahead of us.  
I'm afraid we've lost our lead, Senpai.  
  
**???:**  
  
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)  
  
**Mash:**   
And since she defeated the enemies trying to stop her, she won't have to sit the next round out, either.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Wait for me, Erice!  
  
**Mash:**   
...It looks like she's ignoring  
our attempts to contact her.  
  
＄94-04-78-20-1-0  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Go for it, Voyager.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Time to roll the dice!  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
Okay!  
  
**Mash:**   
We're in the lead again! Although...we're only a hundred meters ahead of Erice.  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
What do you guys think you're lookin' at?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Wow... Your hair is all shiny. Like mine...  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Oh? Hell yeah, nice to find someone who gets it!  
That's right! Just keep your eyes on me!  
  
**Mash:**   
It looks like we're up against Kintoki next, Senpai.  
Get ready to&ndash;  
  
**Voyager:**   
Can I touch it?  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Hell yeah you can. In fact, how'd ya like  
to go on a special golden shoulder ride?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Yes, please!  
  
**Mash:**   
Um... Maybe we won't need to worry  
about fighting him after all?  
  
**Erice:**   
Hey! Get your hands off my Voyager!!!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Who's the chick blowin' her top?  
Your gal pal?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Does that mean friend? Yes. Erice is my gal pal.  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Gotcha. Though damn, I gotta say, kid,  
your pal's packing some serious heat.  
  
**Voyager:**   
...Like fire?  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
No, no, not that kinda heat. I mean, well...  
She's kinda dangerous, right?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...?  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Dammit, how else can I put this?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is it? Do you sense something off about her?  
  
---  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Oh, hey, Boss.  
What's up with that chick?  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
She's like a human, a demon, and even a god all rolled into one. I can't make heads or tails of all that.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
I had her pegged as some kind of sea and underworld god High Servant myself.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
I had her pegged as some kind of syncretic sea, water, and underworld god myself.  
  
**Edison:**   
That's not even getting into how she doesn't realize she's a Servant. She thinks she's still an ordinary human.  
  
**Edison:**   
But she's clearly got some sort of divine protection goin' on. I'm guessing it's the god of dea&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
Will you stop talking about me like I'm not here!?  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Oh right. Sorry 'bout that, girlie.  
I can be a little intransitive sometimes.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do you mean “insensitive”?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you mean “inconsiderate”?  
  
---  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
That's the one.  
Anyway, I'm golden sorry.  
  
**Erice:**   
#### Just fight already!!!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Oh, yeah! Fair 'nough!  
All right, let's do this thing!  
  
＄94-04-78-20-1-1  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
This here's as far as I go, Boss.  
But I wish ya golden luck with what's ta come.  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Oh, and be sure you don't make that Erice girl cry,  
you hear me?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course not.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Voyager wouldn't let me even if I wanted to.  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
That might be hard... Erice is a crybaby. Kind of...  
  
**Voyager:**   
But I'll try.  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
You do that, kid. I mean, little bro.  
I'll be rootin' for ya, one golden soul to another.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Thanks. You're pretty golden yourself.  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Ya know, you're shiny like a star, but Erice there's made of darker stuff.  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
And even while she's dealin' with all that,  
she's out fightin' all on her own, right?  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Gotta say, your pal's a hell of a gal.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Yeah. She is.  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice just rolled her dice.  
She's now about three hundred meters ahead of us.  
  
＄94-04-78-20-1-5  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Sorry, guess I got kinda carried away.  
Prob'ly 'cause my mind was still on Erice.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Are you worried about her?  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
It's like...I'm gettin' some real bad vibes from her.  
Like she's hidin' somethin' real dark.  
  
**Erice:**   
What're you guys talking about?  
You've been gossiping about me, haven't you?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Go on ahead, Erice.  
We're talking man-to-man here.  
  
**Erice:**   
Oh, is that so? Fine then, go right ahead.  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
So she's battlin' her own demons in addition to all her other enemies, and all alone. Your pal really is a hell of a gal.  
  
**Voyager:**   
She is...  
  
＄94-04-78-20-2-0  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Come on. We have to catch up to her.  
  
---  
  
**Marie:**   
Wait! Don't leave me behind!  
  
**Mash:**   
Marie? Where were you?  
  
**Marie:**   
I was hiding from that golden warrior.  
I just can't handle people like that.  
  
**Edison:**   
Hmm... I'm surprised to hear that. I thought royalty and gold went together like syrup and pancakes.  
  
**Marie:**   
But he's a barbarian! A beast!  
  
**Edison:**   
Excuse me...?  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.  
Besides, there's no one more civilized than you.  
  
**Edison:**   
Well, of course not!  
But anyway, we digress.  
  
**Edison:**   
What are you doing, Fujimaru? Civilization can't  
be left to stagnate. It&ndash;and by extension,  
we&ndash;must always be moving forward!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay, got it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Fine. It'd be nice if someone could at least guaranteeour destination is a good one, though.  
  
---  
  
＄94-04-78-21-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
There we go.  
We just jumped ahead about a thousand meters!  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
That's nothing! I'll show you REAL impressive jumping&ndash;like leaping over no fewer than eight boats!  
  
**Mash:**   
Here comes Ushiwakamaru!  
  
＄94-04-78-21-1-1  
  
**Mash:**   
We won, Senpai! We defeated Ushiwakamaru!  
  
**Marie:**   
What a wonderful show♪  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
...Before I go, there is one thing  
I would like to ask. Who are you?  
  
**Marie:**   
You mean you don't know?  
I'm Marie, of course. Vive la France♪  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
...All right, I'll leave it at that.  
But not before you answer me this:  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
What is your role in this world?  
  
**Marie:**   
My role? Well, that's rude.  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice just appeared behind us.  
She's only about a hundred meters away now.  
  
＄94-04-78-21-1-5  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
It's over. You must remain here for a single turn.  
  
**Edison:**   
And there goes Erice.  
Luckily, she didn't roll too high.  
  
**Mash:**   
But it won't be easy to increase our lead now that we have to sit out a turn.  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh my, this is so thrilling.  
I'm positively on pins and needles♪  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
So you're only watching from the sidelines, without  
even trying to help [♂ Lord /♀️ Lady] Fujimaru?  
And you call yourself [♂ his /♀️ her] friend?  
  
**Marie:**   
Don't look at me like that. I just came along because I hadn't had my fill of fun yet.  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
If that's true, it would mean you don't have a Master.  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
And in this world, the only way such a being can continue to exist is if they fill some sort of role.  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
So what's yours, Marie Antoinette?  
  
**Marie:**   
I don't owe you a single word  
of explanation, but&ndash;  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice just appeared behind us.  
And she's looking this way.  
  
＄94-04-78-21-2-0  
  
**Marie:**   
I'm the queen. I am queen now, as I was in life. My job is to rule over my people, and to be the recipient of their respect and admiration.  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
And can you do that job while kicking back and  
watching your allies battle from the sidelines?  
  
**Marie:**   
That's for the people to decide.  
Whether they praise us, or blame us, is up to them.  
  
**Erice:**   
I have nothing but praise for you, Queen Marie!  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice?  
  
**Marie:**   
Why thank you, Erice. So you must have been watching.  
  
**Erice:**   
Yes, Your Majesty. I don't know if you're aware of this, but soon after I came to this world...  
  
**Erice:**   
...I saw you declaring yourself a player back in Akihabara, though from a ways away.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait. Marie's a player?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
First I'm hearing about this.  
  
---  
  
**Marie:**   
Fujimaru, remember how we first  
met back in the werewolf house?  
  
**Marie:**   
And do you remember how everyone there had left their Masters in Akihabara...  
  
**Marie:**   
...and come to challenge this Monde du Jeu world of their own volition?  
  
**Marie:**   
I'm the one who invited them.  
  
**Marie:**   
Doing everything our Masters say is dreadfully boring, after all, and we have just as much of a right to enjoy ourselves as anybody, don't you think?  
  
**Marie:**   
Every Servant who accepted my invitation and came to that house was there of their own free will.  
  
**Marie:**   
That was when we all became players, and set about playing in this world on our own.  
  
**Marie:**   
I suppose you could call it a Servant revolution of sorts.  
  
**Mash:**   
I know this is only a game world, but even so...  
  
**Mash:**   
Servants voluntarily turning against their Masters?  
Is that even possible?  
  
**Edison:**   
You do see the occasional Servant going rogue. Here in this world, having that many Rogue Servants would truly be a revolution!  
  
**Edison:**   
But once you've gone rogue, what do you do for your magical energy supply?  
  
**Edison:**   
Based on my understanding of how things work in this world's Akihabara...  
  
**Edison:**   
...a Servant that separated from their Master would lose their connection to their Master's Holy Grail, and their Spirit Origin could disappear at any time.  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh, our Masters in Akihabara know about our decision, and they're fine with it. So since we're still connected to them, we don't have to worry about disappearing.  
  
**Marie:**   
It just goes to show how much Masters love their Servants!  
  
**Marie:**   
So as long as the people sing my praises and support my decisions, I'm free to do as I like.  
  
**Marie:**   
I can be my own king, and rule over myself.  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
No one calling themself a king could be that  
removed from the ways of this world.  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Marie, you are nothing more than a fool treating the Monde du Jeu as your personal playground!  
  
**Erice:**   
Yoshitsune&ndash;I mean, Ushiwakamaru.  
  
**Erice:**   
I respect you deeply,  
but I would never try to imitate your way of life.  
  
**Erice:**   
If anything, right now, I think you're much more out of line than Queen Marie.  
  
**Erice:**   
You're just playing the part this game forced upon you. I can barely stand to see you like this.  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Is that so?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You just thought about cutting her, didn't you?  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Hahaha, well, I can't say the thought of giving her  
a little cut didn't cross my mind for a moment.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You just thought about killing her, didn't you?  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
N-not at all. I'm perfectly fine.  
I'm Ushiwakamaru, you know. Always calm.  
  
**Edison:**   
(I think that's exactly what Master was worried about...)  
  
---  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Ahem. Very well, Erice, then let me ask you this:  
Who are you, and what do you fight for!?  
  
**Erice:**   
I...  
Right now, I'm...  
  
**Erice:**   
...Fujimaru's enemy.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No. You're not just an enemy.  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're also my worthy rival.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're also my respected opponent.  
  
---  
  
＄94-04-78-22-1-0  
  
**Erice:**   
Gaah! I can't believe you, Master of Chaldea. How can you say something so cheesy and keep a straight face!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't know. You tell me.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
F-fine, I guess I can leave it at that!  
Now come on, let's keep going!  
  
**Voyager:**   
Okay.  
Hup!  
  
**Mash:**   
There we go. We're almost to the goal now.  
  
**Tawara Touta:**   
About time you got here. I'll whip up something real special. While I'd like to start with some yummy rice, we've gotta get this fight out of the way first!

**Tawara Touta:**   
Nice job! Just sit tight, and I'll cook you some delicious rice as a reward!  
  
**Mash:**   
Thank you, but we're kind of in a hurry right now, so maybe some other time. We do appreciate it, though...  
  
**Erice:**   
There! I caught up!  
  
＄94-04-78-22-1-5  
  
**Tawara Touta:**   
That was a good fight.  
Here, have some rice.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Rice?  
  
**Edison:**   
Erice just took her turn.  
It seems she moved about three hundred meters.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Does it taste good?  
  
**Tawara Touta:**   
Of course it does. The more you chew,  
the more you can taste its sweetness.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
You're next, kid.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I can't roll them.  
  
**Voyager:**   
There, see?  
  
**Erice:**   
Why're you guys just playing around?  
  
＄94-04-78-23-1-0  
  
**Mash:**   
There's Erice. She's neck and neck with us now!  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice!  
  
**Tawara Touta:**   
Hey there! Would you care for some delicious rice, too?  
  
**Erice:**   
...Huh? Rice? Why rice?  
  
**Tawara Touta:**   
There's nothing like sharing rice from the same pot to strengthen a relationship. Don't you all agree?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Totally.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's the best.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I agree too. There's something very comforting about good, tasty rice. Though freshly baked bread is a close second.  
  
**Erice:**   
Um... You do get that we're enemies, right?  
  
**Mash:**   
Right. I suppose we are, aren't we?  
  
**Tawara Touta:**   
But you guys are friends, aren't you?  
  
**Erice:**   
What? No. No!  
  
**Voyager:**   
...Do we have to fight? No matter what?  
  
**Erice:**   
Yes, Voyager. We do.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Because you want to save me?  
  
**Erice:**   
How many times do I have to say&ndash;  
  
**Voyager:**   
But...that's no different from killing.  
  
**Erice:**   
...!  
  
**Mash:**   
What do you mean, Voyager?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you saying Erice's “Grim Reaper” performance andher affection for her friends are the same thing?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How can those be the same?  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
You say you're doing this for everyone else, Erice.  
But...you're really doing it for yourself.  
  
**Voyager:**   
You don't kill because you want to.  
You do it because you want purpose.  
  
**Erice:**   
...You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm nothing but a selfish, self-absorbed, egotistical jerk.  
  
**E：Erice:**   
But what else can I be with this cursed body!?  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm picking up a magical energy signal.  
It's extremely powerful!  
  
**E：Erice:**   
So who do I have to fight this time?  
Another shadow, or that Servant?  
  
**Tawara Touta:**   
If you mean me, then nope. I'm not your opponent.  
  
**Tawara Touta:**   
Right, Voyager?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Uh-huh. I'll do it.  
  
**E：Erice:**   
Voyager? You're...going to fight me?  
  
**Voyager:**   
I need you, Erice.  
And I'm going to prove it.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Because I know you and I feel the same way.  
  
**E：Erice:**   
...Fine. Then let's see what you can  
really do, too, Master of Chaldea!  
  
＄94-04-78-23-1-1  
  
**Erice:**   
Gaah!  
(Huff...huff!)  
  
**Voyager:**   
I won, Erice.  
Now I know for sure.  
  
**Voyager:**   
You do too, don't you?  
  
**Erice:**   
...Shut up. Just shut up!  
  
**Erice:**   
You're not my Voyager anymore!  
You belong to Chaldea now!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're wrong, Erice.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If that's what you think, then take a look at this.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
...A game piece? What about it?  
  
**Voyager:**   
I gave it to [♂ him /♀️ her],  
so that [♂ he /♀️ she] could come to this world.  
  
**Erice:**   
You did?  
Then...you invited Fujimaru here?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Uh-huh. I asked [♂ him /♀️ her] to come here,  
because I want to help you.  
  
**Erice:**   
Then...you don't belong to Chaldea after all?  
  
**Voyager:**   
This isn't about orders or summonings.  
  
**Voyager:**   
They came because I asked them.  
  
**Voyager:**   
They rode the tram with me,  
and played lots of games with me...  
  
**Voyager:**   
So now, they're my friends.  
  
**Erice:**   
So, I've just been getting worked up about a misunderstanding all this time?  
  
**Mash:**   
All I can say is, Voyager has never been Chaldea's property. No one has.  
  
**Mash:**   
They all live their own lives the way they want to.  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm no different.  
I want to live that way too, along with Senpai...  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Mash:**   
...Isn't it the same for you, Erice?  
Don't you also live your own life the way you want?  
  
**Erice:**   
...I'm not so sure. Honestly, I feel like I've just been playing a role more than living my life.  
  
**Mash:**   
What do you mean?  
  
**Erice:**   
I was born with a curse instead of a Holy Grail...  
  
**Erice:**   
...so I used it to strike out and live on my own.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
You mentioned evil spirits earlier.  
Are those the black things you use in combat?  
  
**Erice:**   
Yes. They're malicious souls who are  
constantly trying to consume me.  
  
**Edison:**   
Souls? Is that a figure of speech, or&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
No. They're very literal souls of the dead.  
  
**Edison:**   
Are they now!? You know, I've always been fascinated with the soul. Even I was never able to fully decipher its true nature.  
  
**Edison:**   
I have to say, I'm hard-pressed to believe an ordinary human could make such masterful use of them as you do!  
  
**Edison:**   
No wonder we suspected your power comes from some sort of god of the underworld, as Emiya here suggested.  
  
**Edison:**   
Erice, if you don't mind my asking, what about your parents? What do they&ndash;  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice doesn't have parents.  
  
**Edison:**   
Oh... I see. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
It's okay. I was so young when they died  
that I barely even remember them.  
  
**Erice:**   
Although...when you think about it,  
it is kind of messed up.  
  
**Erice:**   
My own parents are basically no more  
real to me than the evil spirits.  
  
**F：Erice:**   
...The nameless souls that have haunted me my whole life.  
  
**F：Erice:**   
The evil spirits of people who never made a name for themselves, forgotten soon after departing this world.  
  
**F：Erice:**   
I'd never made a name for myself, either.  
But I wanted to.  
  
**F：Erice:**   
So I began taming the evil spirits, summoning them as twisting fingerlike branches and blades, and learned to use them as extensions of myself...as weapons.  
  
**F：Erice:**   
Eventually, I gave them a name: Erlkönig.  
From then on, I played the part of a grim reaper...  
  
**F：Erice:**   
...because it was the only thing I could do.  
  
**Mash:**   
Maybe so, but your life is still your own.  
You can choose how you want to live it.  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**Marie:**   
Hey, Fujimaru?  
Maybe it's time we got going?  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
I think you're right.  
  
**Edison:**   
Indeed.  
This is where we go our separate ways, Fujimaru.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are you talking about?  
  
---  
  
**Edison:**   
Take a look at the path we've traveled.  
  
**???:**  
  
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)  
  
**Mash:**   
The ghosts? But I thought they weren't  
going to do anything to us.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
They probably changed the rules  
on us after that last battle.  
  
**Erice:**   
...You mean, the one Fujimaru and I just fought?  
  
**Marie:**   
So they were just another part of the game's rules earlier, but now you're saying they've become players?  
  
**Edison:**   
All I can say for certain is that direct conflict  
between two players changed something.  
  
**Edison:**   
If that conflict managed to change even  
the very rules of this world...  
  
**Edison:**   
Well, it just goes to show what we humans can  
do when we put our minds to it, doesn't it?  
  
**Erice:**   
...!  
  
**???:**  
  
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)  
  
**Mash:**   
There's a pack of monsters headed  
up the mountain towards us!  
  
**Edison:**   
Emiya and I will hold them off while the rest of you keep moving. Off you go now, youngsters.  
  
**Voyager:**   
So you are going to stay on Earth, huh?  
  
**Edison:**   
Indeed. Such is the role those of us who seek to reach the stars must sometimes play.  
  
**Edison:**   
Though those of us in different nations may have fought bitterly at times, we still shared the same goal.  
  
**Edison:**   
Voyager, you are the embodiment of humanity's accumulated scientific knowledge and a shining symbol of our hope for the future.  
  
**Edison:**   
Speaking for all humanity,  
we couldn't be prouder of you!  
  
**Voyager:**   
I'll never forget you. I promise.  
  
**Edison:**   
I know you won't. All right, go on then.  
You have a star of your own to seek, after all.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Okay.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
A star, huh? I just hope it doesn't turn out to be a pit of darkness, especially after everything we did to get there.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I'll be fine.  
You know, it's pretty dark in space.  
  
**Emiya Alter:**   
...That so.  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai? Shall we&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah. Let's get going. You too, Erice.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Come on, Erice. You're coming with us.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh? Me?  
  
**Mash:**   
That's a great idea!  
  
**Erice:**   
Hold on. Why would you want me?  
I lost, remember?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's not about winning or losing.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do I really have to spell it out?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
...You're right. I know exactly why.  
  
**Erice:**   
You know, Voyager, I really&ndash;  
  
**Voyager:**   
I'm glad. You're finally being honest.  
  
**Erice:**   
Ugh, did you have to say that now!?  
  
**Mash:**   
We're jumping ahead about one kilometer.  
This should put us right by the shrine's main gate!  
  
＄94-04-78-23-1-5  
  
**Erice:**   
What a joke. All that big talk, and you still couldn't even beat me when I'm all alone.  
  
**Voyager:**   
It's not about winning or losing.  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh?  
  
**Voyager:**   
I know how you feel now, Erice.  
  
**Voyager:**   
You do too, don't you?  
  
**Erice:**   
...Shut up. Just shut up!  
  
**Erice:**   
You're not my Voyager anymore!  
You belong to Chaldea now!

**???:**  
Grr... Grrrrrr...  
Hnn... Gnnn...  
  
**Marie:**   
You poor thing. You must be in so much pain.  
What's the matter? Is it an old wound?  
  
**C：???:**  
...I can endure any pain from wounds inflicted by blades and arrows.  
  
**C：???:**  
Even my death came and went in mere moments,  
after which there was nothing but pure darkness.  
  
**C：???:**  
No, what truly frightens me is what came after I came to my senses in the underworld.  
  
**C：???:**  
My injuries should no longer sting now that my body has returned to the earth, yet my heart still aches as though its wounds were fresh.  
  
**Marie:**   
Yes... I know what you mean. As long as we retain our souls, the wounds in our hearts never stop hurting.  
  
**Marie:**   
You know, you and I have a lot in common. We both ruled over peaceful countries, adored and beloved by our people, but then&ndash;  
  
**C：???:**  
All of a sudden, our people betrayed us.  
Despised us. Tore us from our loved ones.  
  
**Marie:**   
I see. You had a son, didn't you?  
  
**C：???:**  
G-g-ghhh... Grrrrrr...!  
  
**B：???:**  
GRAAAAAAAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Marie:**   
It's okay. You cry all you need. It won't help you forget...but it will help you feel better.  
  
**Marie:**   
Fortunately, we're surrounded by darkness right now, so you don't have to worry about anyone seeing you, or laughing at you, or mocking you.  
  
**B：???:**  
Hnn... Hnn...  
  
**C：???:**  
...It's cold here. So cold I can barely move. If only this cold would come for my heart as well, and let me fall back into eternal sleep.  
  
**C：???:**  
Instead, the empty darkness only serves to remind me of my fondest memories of days gone by, in all too vivid color.  
  
**Marie:**   
You know, if you're cold...I could help keep you warm.  
  
**C：???:**  
What did you say?  
  
**Marie:**   
If you like, I'd be happy to sit next to you. It should be at least a little better than being all on your own.  
  
**C：???:**  
...Heh. Hahaha. Ahhh ha ha ha!  
  
**C：???:**  
You truly do not fear me, do you?  
How interesting.  
  
**Marie:**   
Would you rather be by yourself?  
  
**C：???:**  
Not at all. I would welcome your company.  
Come, sit.  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh wow, you really are freezing cold.  
You poor thing.  
  
**C：???:**  
And you are indeed warm to the touch. This takes me back to my most blissful days, when I would fall asleep with my beloved child in my arms...  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh yes, I know what you mean. The time I had with my little Charles was the happiest time of my life!  
  
**Marie:**   
But now, it's just you and me here.  
The least we can do is console each other.  
  
**C：???:**  
Yes... Indeed. Ahh, you are so nice and warm.  
  
**C：???:**  
Perhaps it would not be so bad for both of us to remain here in darkness, and return to our eternal slumber...  
  
**Marie:**   
That does sound nice. To forget everything that happened...and finally be at peace.  
  
**Marie:**   
But...I'm afraid it'd only be a matter of  
time until we'd have to wake up again.  
  
**C：???:**  
Why would we wake up? The outside world is cruel and unforgiving.  
  
**Marie:**   
That's why we'll eventually be discovered here,  
and our peaceful retreat ruined.  
  
**Marie:**   
You and I are both just scapegoats for our people. Once they found us, they would blame us for all their woes and take their frustrations out on us.  
  
**Marie:**   
Who knows? Someone might be headed up the mountain even as we speak.  
  
**C：???:**  
Heh... Interesting. If you are right about that...  
  
**C：???:**  
...then those seeking this darkness  
will never see this place's true nature.  
  
**C：???:**  
They may think they are making their way to a shrine on the summit of a well-known spiritual mountain...  
  
**C：???:**  
...but in fact, their pilgrimage leads them directly into the very depths of the underworld, from which there can be no return.  
  
**C：???:**  
And they will be none the wiser. Hehehe...  
They will have not the slightest idea! Grrraaah...!  
  
＄94-04-78-24-2-0  
  
**Mash:**   
...Is this the goal?  
  
**Erice:**   
I think so. And according to the rumors I heard...  
  
**Erice:**   
...this is where I'll find my friend.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How do you know that?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who did you hear that from?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Back when I heard Queen Marie declare her intent to become a player...  
  
**Erice:**   
...I heard her say it.  
  
**Marie:**   
Me? What did I say?  
  
**Erice:**   
You counted five games sleeping here in Monde du Jeu.  
  
**Erice:**   
One was Culdpoly.  
One was Werewolves in the Haunted House.  
  
**Erice:**   
One was Pioneer Heroes.  
One was Orbat Clash.  
  
**Erice:**   
And the last one was the one we've been playing here,  
Dragon Search.  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh, yes... I suppose I might have said something along those lines. But I forgot all about it.  
  
**Marie:**   
After all, those were just rumors I heard from the Meeple, so I didn't know if I could trust them.  
  
**Erice:**   
Well, so far, everything has turned out just like you said.  
  
**Erice:**   
And that must mean there's a dragon in here&ndash;one wearing bridal wear.  
  
**Erice:**   
I remember you said the dragon was trapped in the darkness of a shrine that lies at the top of this sacred mountain...  
  
**Erice:**   
...waiting for a player to come find her,  
as though you were calling on us to act.  
  
**Erice:**   
Many Servants answered your call,  
and set off on an adventure to find her.  
  
**Erice:**   
I was too scared to say anything at the time...  
  
**Erice:**   
...but I swore to myself that I would do whatever it took to save her.  
  
**Erice:**   
You'd do the same, right, Voyager?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Are you talking about Koyo?  
  
**Mash:**   
You know this person&ndash;um, dragon?  
  
**Erice:**   
She's one of my best friends. I'm sure of it. I mean, how many dragons in bridal wear can there be!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It is a little hard to imagine... So, what's she like, anyway?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So who is this, um, Koyo?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
You'll see when you meet her. She's one of the best people you'll ever meet. She's kind, and considerate, and she's always got your back no matter what!  
  
**Marie:**   
Well, I can't wait to meet her♪  
  
**Marie:**   
Go on, Erice. Open the door.  
  
**Erice:**   
Yes, Your Majesty. Without further ado...  
  
**Erice:**   
I'll break this seal right now!  
  
**E：???:**  
I must not wake from this dream.  
Do not wake from this dream...  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh? Who're you?  
  
**E：???:**  
That is what I would like to know of you. Whoever you are, you will pay dearly for wresting me from my dream.  
  
**Erice:**   
I don't have time for this. I know Koyo's in that shrine. Now tell me exactly where I can find her.  
  
**E：???:**  
Oh? Koyo, you say?  
Now where did you hear that name?  
  
**Erice:**   
Not that it's any of your business, but...  
  
**Erice:**   
I got to know her in Akihabara, where I work.  
  
**E：???:**  
I have no recollection of that.  
  
**Erice:**   
Why would you? I don't know who you are, and I don't care. Now tell me where Koyo is already!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait, Erice.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hang on. Whoever she is...she has a tail.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai. I noticed it too, but I wasn't  
sure if I should point it out or not...  
  
**Mash:**   
It looks like a dragon's tail,  
or at least some kind of reptile.  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh? Did you say a tail?  
  
**Erice:**   
It's so dark I can barely make it out,  
but...it looks kind of familiar...  
  
**Voyager:**   
That's Koyo.  
Her Spirit Origin's the same.  
  
**Marie:**   
Her Spirit Origin?  
You mean, you can tell?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There, my eyes finally adjusted to the darkness.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A tail...and horns? Is she an oni!?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh!? Wh-what's going on?  
You don't look anything like the Koyo I&ndash;  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
You there.  
You say you recognize me, young man?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Uh-huh. I never forget people.  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh! An unforgettable Heroic Spirit...  
I think I finally got what you meant, Voyager.  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Voyager? I don't recall hearing that name before...  
  
**Voyager:**   
Because...here, we haven't met yet.  
  
**Voyager:**   
The war hasn't happened yet, right?  
  
**Mash:**   
War? Do you mean the last Holy Grail  
War you mentioned earlier?  
  
**Mash:**   
I think you said it takes place&ndash;  
  
**Voyager:**   
A little after your time, yes.  
  
**Voyager:**   
But it also happens in a different world than yours...  
  
**Voyager:**   
Both Erice, and I&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Came here from that world's future?  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
Uh-huh. That's why you don't know us yet, Koyo.  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
So...you are saying we meet in the future?  
That sounds like something out of a storybook.  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Is your purpose here to trick me? To entrap me?  
  
**Erice:**   
Of course not. You're one of our closest friends.  
We'd never do anything like that to you.  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Oh?  
  
**Erice:**   
I know you have no reason to trust us, seeing as we're still complete strangers to you, but&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
Wait. Hold on. I was planning to rescue you and bring you back to our original time...  
  
**Erice:**   
But since you're actually from this time, it wouldn't be right to bring you back with us, would it? It would be like time travel for you, or being spirited away to a strange, unknown world.  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Does this mean I have friends in your time, girl?  
  
**Erice:**   
Yup. Uh, I mean, yes.  
And you have a Master, too.  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
A Master?  
  
**Erice:**   
Oh, but that doesn't mean you're her slave or anything. You and Karin are friends, too. Though between the two of you, you'd think she was your Servant rather than the other way around.  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
I see. So my future Master's name is Karin.  
  
**Erice:**   
That's right. She's the same age as me, and... Well, she's not a bad kid, but she can be a little...complicated?  
  
**Erice:**   
Let's just say she reeeally appreciates her freedom.  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
So, she is a girl. She must be cute.  
  
**Erice:**   
You'll see! I'll introduce you myself!  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Hehe. That does sound like something to look forward to.  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Just...be certain you do not betray me, all right, girl?  
  
**Erice:**   
I won't! I promise!  
  
**Marie:**   
Liar.  
  
**Erice:**   
Wha...?  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Hm? What are you doing ther&ndash;  
  
**Marie:**   
I am here to accuse Erice Utsumi of betrayal. J'accuse!  
  
**Marie:**   
I will see her crimes laid bare,  
and her just punishment meted out!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where's this coming from? She didn't do anything wrong.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Um, weren't we done with the werewolf game already?  
  
---  
  
**Marie:**   
If that's really what you believe,  
then take a good look at her.  
  
**Marie:**   
See how pale she is? The way she can't stop trembling? Her uneven breathing? Isn't it obvious she feels guilty?  
  
**Erice:**   
Your Majesty? I don't understand.  
What in the world did I&ndash;  
  
**Marie:**   
Don't play dumb, murderer.  
No, you're not just a murderer.  
  
**Marie:**   
You took the life of royalty&ndash;  
my own, precious son, Louis Charles.  
  
**Erice:**   
...!  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice killed your son!?  
That... That can't be&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
...So you knew about Louis.  
  
**Marie:**   
Of course I did. I'm his mother.  
  
**Mash:**   
Then...you don't deny it, Erice?  
Does that mean you really&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
It's true. I... I killed&ndash;  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
GrrrRRRAAAH...!  
  
**Erice:**   
Eek!  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Is this true, Marie?  
Was your son&ndash;  
  
**Marie:**   
You heard her. She just confessed plain as day.  
  
**Erice:**   
I didn't know what I was doing!  
  
**Erice:**   
Louis's Master had fallen into a self-destructive spiral, and he...began destroying other people's lives as well...  
  
**Erice:**   
He ambushed me, but...I fought back...  
and managed to turn the tables on him...  
  
**Erice:**   
But, because of that...  
Louis became unable to maintain his Spirit Origin...  
  
**Marie:**   
Any more excuses you'd like to make?  
  
**Erice:**   
Please, listen to me! This has been eating me up inside. I really wanted to apologize to you, but...  
  
**Erice:**   
But I was so scared...  
I couldn't bring myself to say anything...  
  
**Marie:**   
Too little, too late, “Grim Reaper.”  
  
**Marie:**   
You've always been a Servant hunter.  
That's the job you chose for yourself, isn't it?  
  
**Marie:**   
Sanson may have been a killer, but he also had a deep appreciation for the arts. Even the Phantom of the Opera genuinely loved beautiful things.  
  
**Marie:**   
What do you have besides your talent for murder?  
Anything? Anything at all?  
  
**Erice:**   
Your Majesty&ndash;  
  
**Marie:**   
Silence! You have no right to speak my title, let alone my name!  
  
**Marie:**   
You may say you admire me&ndash;that you respect the royal family and are happy to submit to our authority&ndash;but when push comes to shove, you're the first to betray us.  
  
**Marie:**   
Stupid, insufferable common rabble like you is responsible for Charles's and my death.  
  
**Marie:**   
In Charles's case, not even becoming a Heroic Spirit was enough to stop people like you from killing him. How many lives will you take before you're satisfied!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Stop it. You've said your piece.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's enough, Marie.  
  
---  
  
**Marie:**   
...Fine. If you insist.  
  
**Marie:**   
But...  
  
**E：Kijyo Koyo:**   
#### GrrRRRRRR...!  
  
**Mash:**   
She just transformed into something  
more like a dinosaur than a dragon!  
  
**Marie:**   
You may have a hard time stopping Kijyo Koyo there.  
  
**Marie:**   
Especially now that she's fully given in to her rage!  
  
**G：Kijyo Koyo:**   
GRAAAAAAAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Mash:**   
It looks like we're going to have to fight.  
Awaiting your orders!  
  
**Voyager:**   
You too, Erice.  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh?  
  
**Voyager:**   
We can't lose now.  
We have to help Koyo.  
  
**Erice:**   
...Right!  
  
＄94-04-78-24-2-1  
  
**Marie:**   
#### Stop this at once!  
  
**C：Marie:**   
Well now...  
  
**Mash:**   
Huh? There are two Maries?  
  
＄94-04-78-24-3-0  
  
**Erice:**   
What's going on?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Their Spirit Origins look alike...  
But the two of them are so different...  
  
**Marie:**   
That's right. She's another version of me.  
My own personal Dragon Witch.  
  
**Erice:**   
Then...does that mean she's your Alter?  
  
**Marie?:**  
I don't know what an Alter is,  
but I can assure you, I am Queen Marie.  
  
**Marie:**   
So YOU'RE the one who trapped Koyo  
and me in the darkness of that shrine.  
  
**Marie?:**  
Well, we don't need two queens here, do we?  
  
**Marie?:**  
You can vouch for that, right, Koyo? Having too many women around is how trouble starts, how people first lose their way...  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Grrr...!  
  
**Marie:**   
Then tell me this, my other self:  
Did you ever try to conduct yourself like a queen?  
  
**Marie?:**  
What a ridiculous question.  
Everything I do is queenly, by definition.  
  
**Marie?:**  
But, if you're asking if I ever dedicated myself to bettering the lives of my subjects...  
  
**Marie?:**  
Then, no. I never considered such a thing to be among my responsibilities.  
  
**Marie:**   
How could you be so callous!?  
  
**Marie?:**  
This whole world of Monde du Jeu is like a giant festival. Anything at all could happen here.  
  
**Marie?:**  
It's a place where everyone has their own Holy Grail and a bond with a Servant, but no one can live life like an ordinary human.  
  
**Marie?:**  
You saw those humans who had turned  
into Meeple, didn't you?  
  
**Marie?:**  
Those idiotic walking tributes to mediocrity don't even have the decency to be ashamed of losing their individuality.  
  
**Marie?:**  
I could never sully my beautiful, shining soul just to help the likes of them!  
  
**Marie?:**  
That's why I gave up on my subject&ndash;my player.  
  
**Marie?:**  
But that pitiful fool still worships me. Even now, I'm taking advantage of him to maintain my Spirit Origin.  
  
**Marie?:**  
You heard my call for Servants to throw off their shackles and become players too, didn't you, Erice?  
  
**Erice:**   
...Yes, I did. I thought it was amazing. I really admired how free and full of confidence you seemed to be.  
  
**Erice:**   
Was it all just a lie to lure me here?  
So you could punish me for my transgressions?  
  
**Marie?:**  
You conceited little twit! Do you think  
this is all about you!? ...Just kidding.  
  
**Marie?:**  
You're right. It was all to bring you here.  
  
**Erice:**   
You...really hate me that much?  
  
**Marie?:**  
If that's what you want me to say, then I will.  
Maybe it'll even help you feel like you matter.  
  
**Erice:**   
I... I can't...  
  
**Marie?:**  
...Heh. Hehehe. Good, Erice. Very good.  
That's the pain I want you to feel.  
  
**Marie?:**  
Now all you need is a single tear of  
regret to really bring it all home.  
  
**Marie?:**  
That's the sort of drama that should thrill the pathetic commoners who support me.  
  
**Mash:**   
What do you mean?  
Who would be thrilled by tormenting Erice?  
  
**Marie?:**  
Don't be silly. The kind of ordinary commoners you find anywhere and everywhere can't get enough of this stuff.  
  
**Marie?:**  
I'm only giving them what they want.  
In fact, I'm the embodiment of it.  
  
**Marie?:**  
I am a ruthless, cruel, greedy,  
and unspeakably beautiful queen.  
  
**Marie?:**  
And you, Erice&ndash;you're an offering. A sacrifice to be drawn and quartered for the amusement of the masses.  
  
**Erice:**   
...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why her?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
...Huh?  
  
**Marie?:**  
What, you want me to dredge up painful memories again? It was hard enough discussing my son's death the first&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Something's not adding up... How do you even know about Servant Louis?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hold on. How do you even have memories of Erice?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right... That's a good point.  
  
**Mash:**   
A few notable exceptions aside...  
  
**Mash:**   
...a Servant's memories acquired during a materialization are lost when they return to the Throne of Heroes.  
  
**Mash:**   
So there shouldn't be any way for you to know the circumstances of Louis Charles's death in Erice's world.  
  
**Erice:**   
...Do you remember who dealt Louis the killing blow?  
  
**Marie:**   
If you remember what happened in her world that clearly, there's only one explanation that makes sense.  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Grrrrrrrrr!  
  
**Voyager:**   
You must be from the same time and place,  
and saw everything that happened yourself.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who are you, really?  
  
---  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Why...I'm you, Erice.  
  
**Erice:**   
Wha...!?  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
I'm you. I'm the dark, cursed blood  
coursing through your veins.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
I'm an amalgam of what you call evil spirits that has taken the form of the queen you hold in the highest regard.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
I am the Erlkönig who rules over you!  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
You thought I was an alternative version of Marie  
Antoinette? Hehehe, what a truly insipid joke.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Did you really think an immature whelp like yourself had a firm grasp on Marie Antoinette's true nature, Erice?  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
No, your dark and twisted emotions were the perfect seedbed in which to grow a portrait of Marie as the commoners see her.  
  
**Erice:**   
Ghh... Khh...  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Of course on the odd chance that the real Marie was actually summoned, she would be nothing like me.  
  
**Marie:**   
Teeheehee... Is that what you think?  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
...Marie.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
You of all people should be looking down on me. No...you should be completely disgusted by me! Shouldn't you!?  
  
**Marie:**   
Goodness, that brings back memories.  
I remember wearing that mourning dress myself.  
  
**Marie:**   
Whose soul are you mourning, other Marie?  
  
**Marie:**   
Are you grieving over the blood shed by the Bourbon family? Or maybe France's lost past?  
  
**Erice:**   
Queen...Marie...  
  
**Marie:**   
I don't blame you for anything, Erice.  
  
**Marie:**   
When you get right down to it, we Heroic Spirits are no more than somebody else's dream.  
  
**Marie:**   
Other Marie, even if you are no more than a mass of evil spirits given direction and form by Erice's regrets...  
  
**Marie:**   
...you're still a dream somebody else once had.  
It's a great honor; you should be proud.  
  
**Marie:**   
After all, you exist because so many people you ought to love remember you.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
...Ahh, Marie. Heroic Spirit Marie. Your purity of heart never fails to surprise me... Nor your sheer idiocy.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Don't you even think about defending Erice.  
She knows she deserves to be punished for this! She wants to be punished!  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
She wants to wallow in the sludge of her sins until it stains her down to her very soul!  
  
**Voyager:**   
You're wrong.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Erice is stronger than you think.  
  
**Voyager:**   
That's why you'll never beat her.  
  
**Erice:**   
Voyager...  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Hehehe... It doesn't matter how many allies you have, Erice. You'll still always be the same pitiful wretch!  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
There's no escape for you now.  
I will see every last bit of you sullied!  
  
＄94-04-78-24-3-1  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
What a shame, Erice.  
I was so close to sullying you for good!  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
But this isn't over yet!  
I challenge you to another game!  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
And this time, I'm going to sully the entirety of Monde du Jeu itself!  
  
**Erice:**   
W-wait! Come back!  
  
**Mash:**   
The tram that Dark Marie got on  
is going up to the night sky!  
  
**Voyager:**   
That's okay. Here comes another one.  
  
**Voyager:**   
She wants us to go after her.  
  
＄94-04-78-25-1-0  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Grrr?  
  
**Erice:**   
...Yeah, I'm okay.  
Thanks, Koyo.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You can tell what she's saying?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
More or less. There's a trick to it.  
  
**Erice:**   
Koyo's nothing like me. She's a real grown-up. She's always calm, and collected, and super considerate...  
  
**Erice:**   
Right, Voyager?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Definitely.  
  
**Erice:**   
...You didn't have to agree THAT quickly.  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Rrr...  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh! Did she just smile?  
  
**Erice:**   
Yup. Not that hard, right?  
  
**Mash:**   
Right!  
  
**Mash:**   
...I see. So this is how you'd always support one another in “Akihabara.”  
  
**Erice:**   
...At least...I think so.  
  
**Marie:**   
You poor thing. You must really want to go home, huh?  
  
**Erice:**   
...I used to think so. That was the only thing  
on my mind ever since I came to this world.  
  
**Erice:**   
But now...I'm not so sure.  
  
**Erice:**   
Now, I'm wondering what this world really is,  
and why I'm here at all.  
  
**Erice:**   
That evil spirit declared she was going to sully me...  
and she did so while pretending to be Queen Marie.  
  
**Erice:**   
But in my Akihabara, the evil spirits were like my neighbors.  
  
**Erice:**   
They were extremely dangerous, sure,  
but I had to use them in order to protect myself.  
  
**Erice:**   
Maybe this is their way of taking revenge on me?  
Because they're mad at how I've been treating them?  
  
**Erice:**   
Especially now that I'm no longer human,  
but an autonomous, summoned wraith... A S-Servant.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Why...I'm you, Erice.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
And this time,  
I'm going to sully the entire world of Monde du Jeu itself!  
  
**Mash:**   
It didn't look to me like she was  
trying to kill you on a lark.  
  
**Mash:**   
As far as I can tell, this evil spirit still needs you,  
since you were its original host.  
  
**Marie:**   
Well, while I'm glad my name has been cleared...  
  
**Marie:**   
...the idea of someone with my face running around getting  
up to no good still doesn't sit right with me.  
  
**Marie:**   
Besides, she's the one who arranged this trap, and the one who got all the Chaldean Servants mixed up in this mess.  
  
**Marie:**   
So we have to stop her once and for all,  
so she can never get up to no good again!  
  
**Marie:**   
And one more thing. When this is all over, Erice, it'd  
be lovely if you came back to Chaldea with us.  
  
**Marie:**   
Assuming that's what you and Master want too, of course.  
  
**Erice:**   
I...I couldn't.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Whatever you decide, Erice, I'll support your choice.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Consider it another place to call home.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
...  
  
**Mash:**   
(It's a wonderful idea, but...)  
  
**Mash:**   
(...in order to do that, we first need  
to free her from the Monde du Jeu...)  
  
**Mash:**   
By the way, there's one thing that's been nagging at me.  
  
**Mash:**   
Does anyone know where this tram is headed?  
  
**Mash:**   
I mean, there were five mystery games in total,  
and I thought we had cleared them all, so...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe there's another even more hidden secret?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Good point, Senpai. That's probably what it is.  
But there's still a larger problem.  
  
**Mash:**   
Who planned all this in the first place, and why?  
Was it all just Dark Marie?  
  
**Mash:**   
And if she was behind all this...  
  
**Mash:**   
Even if this massive, complicated, yet still somewhat  
convivial trap was her goal right from the beginning&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe the game changed along the way.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe her revolution overwrote the rules.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right... Our actions changed the game, and the  
different rules led to different developments.  
  
**Mash:**   
So the plan couldn't have gone perfectly from the start.  
  
**Mash:**   
Which I guess means we have no way to predict  
where this tram will ultimately end up.  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Voyager:**   
It's okay, Erice. Don't worry.  
  
**Voyager:**   
You're not alone anymore.  
  
**Erice:**   
Voyager?  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Hey, where are you guys right now?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Da Vinci!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Uh... Define “where”?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
We're currently on a tram that's transporting us between tiny worlds...though we still don't know where it's taking us.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Well, we have an emergency request for help here,  
and we're gonna need you guys to fulfill it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A request for help?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where's it coming from?  
  
---  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
That thing's got windows on it, right?  
Take a look outside.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey, where are you guys right now?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Da Vinci!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Uh... Define “where”?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
We're currently on a tram that's transporting us between tiny worlds...though we still don't know where it's taking us.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, we have an emergency request for help here,  
and we're gonna need you guys to fulfill it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A request for help?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where's it coming from?  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
That thing's got windows on it, right?  
Take a look outside.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What am I looking for? I don't see anything.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Over there, Senpai! Take a closer look!  
  
**Mash:**   
There's something coming up from beneath the sea of stars!  
  
**Mash:**   
It's...a giant game board!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What happened to the places we've already been to!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What happened to the games we've been playing!?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Look, Senpai, they're still all here. It looks like the five games we played before were all part of this huge board!  
  
**Mash:**   
It looks like...a large city more than anything.  
  
**Erice:**   
...I remember this place.  
I know this world.  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice...  
  
**Erice:**   
This is...“Shinjuku.”  
  
**Erice:**   
It's the city where I was born.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Then it must be fate you're here, Erice,  
because the people who live there need you to rescue them.  
  
**Erice:**   
Rescue them? Me?  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Some kind of darkness is eroding this city.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
“Darkness”? That's a little vague, no?  
  
---  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Maybe, but it's the only way I can describe it.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Someone summoned a kind of light-rejecting substance that  
looks a lot like mud that's swallowing up the whole city.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think I know who it was: Dark Marie!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Dark Marie's gotta be behind this!  
  
---  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
I'm sorry, who's Dark Marie?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Some kind of darkness is eroding this city.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
“Darkness”? That's a little vague, no?  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Maybe, but it's the only way I can describe it.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Someone summoned a kind of light-rejecting substance that  
looks a lot like mud that's swallowing up the whole city.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think I know who it was: Dark Marie!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Dark Marie's gotta be behind this!  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm sorry, who's Dark Marie?  
  
**Erice:**   
One of the evil spirits that haunt me. She took Marie  
Antoinette's form to manifest outside my body.  
  
**Erice:**   
If she's doing something that could harm  
all the other Heroic Spirits here, then&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We can't stand by and let it happen.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
...Huh? What're you talking about?  
You're not planning to come with me, are you?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You better believe it.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Fujimaru...  
You really are incorrigible, aren't you?  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
Oho. Looks like there was a big  
change when I wasn't looking.  
  
**H：Da Vinci:**   
I'm curious to know what happened...  
but I think that can wait for another time.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oho. Looks like there was a big  
change when I wasn't looking.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm curious to know what happened...  
but I think that can wait for another time.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Okay, Erice, it's time to go face your past...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...so you can take back your present.  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Erice:**   
...I remember this place.  
This is where my grandmother and I used to live.  
  
**Erice:**   
How could I have forgotten it?  
Why couldn't I remember?  
  
**Erice:**   
And why is this place...my past...  
  
**Erice:**   
...only being exposed in this world now?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think this means we made it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm guessing this is the goal.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
...What do you mean? That can't be...  
  
**Erice:**   
...On second thought, maybe I should listen to you.  
I mean, you must've seen lots of strange worlds by now.  
  
**Erice:**   
So I think...I can trust your experience and intuition.  
  
**Mash:**   
...!  
I'm so glad to hear you say that.  
  
**Erice:**   
Hehe.  
Okay, Fujimaru, tell me what you think.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This is the root of all of Monde du Jeu.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This all came from inside your heart, Erice.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
You mean,  
Erice's heart is responsible for creating Monde du Jeu...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I've been thinking about what this mysterious board game means.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This mysterious board game must mean something, and I think I know what.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
The board game...means something?  
I'm not sure what you&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why did it show up in Chaldea in the first place?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why did it invite us inside to begin with?  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Voyager. You and Erice used to be partners, right?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Voyager. You were Erice's Servant back in the real Shinjuku, right?  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
Uh-huh. Erice and I formed a contract.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I said “Let me ask you something,” followed by&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
“Are you my Master?”  
...I remember that.  
  
**Erice:**   
So, what are you saying? You think that has some  
connection to this evil spirit uprising?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You must've gotten some Command Spells as part of your contract, right?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
...Yes, I did. They were branded on my left hand  
at the same time we formed the contract.  
  
**Erice:**   
But they've been gone ever since I changed into this form.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you sure you didn't get anything in exchange for them?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And what also showed up at the same time?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
...!  
  
**Erice:**   
No way... You're saying this whole world&ndash;this  
entire game&ndash;is actually my Command Spells?  
  
**Erice:**   
That the marks of our contract the Holy Grail gave me came  
back in this ridiculous new form after I lost them?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Games are meant to be solved, right?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You've been this game's biggest puzzle all along, Erice.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Ah...  
  
**Erice:**   
...I'd forgotten all about this place from my past.  
These are the memories I'd shut away deep down in my heart.  
  
**Erice:**   
So, are you saying this place we've arrived at now  
that we've solved the mystery of Monde du Jeu...  
  
**Erice:**   
...is actually my own hope come to life?  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm a little taken aback by this too...  
but I can understand where Senpai's coming from.  
  
**Mash:**   
In the Akihabara and Shinjuku from your world,  
everyone has their own personal Holy Grail, right?  
  
**Mash:**   
And the Command Spells that show up on a Master's hand basically act as a terminal connecting back to that Holy Grail.  
  
**Mash:**   
So since Holy Grails grant people's wishes, this world may have appeared as a reflection of your own unconscious desires.  
  
**Mash:**   
In which case, the miracles that Command Spells usually perform through Servants may have manifested more directly, into the form of the city we're in right now.  
  
**Erice:**   
That's... Ahh...  
I hate to admit it, but you might be right.  
  
**Erice:**   
This place is a secret from my past I thought I'd sealed  
away&ndash;a reminder of the hurt I tried not to think about.  
  
**Erice:**   
Which means I was probably trying to destroy this  
world for the same reasons as Louis's Master.  
  
**Erice:**   
I just wanted to destroy. I wanted to hurt myself,  
because it was the only proof that I was alive.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's not true, Erice.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You just wanted to know.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Yeah, that's right. I'm an ignorant child.  
What could I possibly want to know now?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The best way to live your own life.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
I-I... Okay, that might be true, but still!  
  
**Erice:**   
That doesn't give me the right to  
ruin everything else like this...  
  
**Erice:**   
Hell, I don't even have the right to go on living,  
since I couldn't even atone for my own sins...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You already atoned for your sins.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This was never about seeking forgiveness for you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You were just seeking a trial that you would face yourself.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Mash:**   
So that's why this battle took the form of a board game.  
  
**Mash:**   
The Holy Grail didn't do this to punish you.  
It did it to challenge you.  
  
**Erice:**   
So, you're saying all of Monde du Jeu is...a trial?  
A challenge?  
  
**Erice:**   
That I secretly wanted...to atone for my sins?  
  
**Erice:**   
That I wanted to keep on living,  
even though I'm a stupid embarrassment?  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Marie:**   
What's wrong, Erice?  
Please, don't look so forlorn.  
  
**Erice:**   
Your Majesty... I'm sorry.  
I just couldn't bring myself to tell you about Louis...  
  
**Marie:**   
Now now, none of that.  
You've done nothing to apologize for.  
  
**Marie:**   
The Charles you met was already a Heroic Spirit.  
Life and death no longer mattered to him.  
  
**Erice:**   
But, that doesn't change the fact that I killed him!  
  
**Marie:**   
Only because you had no choice. You did it to protect  
yourself, not because you truly wanted to.  
  
**Marie:**   
If you hadn't, there's every possibility that  
Charles would have killed you instead.  
  
**Marie:**   
If anyone was keeping you on edge back here in “Shinjuku”  
and “Akihabara,” I think it might have been you.  
  
**Marie:**   
If your evil spirits took form in this world,  
then I'm just as much to blame for it as anyone.  
  
**Erice:**   
Don't be silly, Your Majesty!  
I know you would never have wanted things to turn out like&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
Oh...  
  
**Marie:**   
See? Sometimes, things turn out a certain way  
no matter how much we may wish otherwise.  
  
**Marie:**   
It's all part of the ties Servants like us inevitably form.  
  
**Marie:**   
As long as humanity's hope and potential can be shown  
in places that have transcended good and evil...  
  
**Marie:**   
...then we'll always be able to prove our worth and value,  
no matter how sullied we may have become.  
  
**Marie:**   
That's what it means to be a Heroic Spirit&ndash;to materialize  
as a Servant in this world. Isn't that right?  
  
**Erice:**   
...I... I don't know. I still can't say for sure.  
  
**Erice:**   
But! If that's true, then...  
  
**Erice:**   
...I want to believe that someone  
like me becoming a Servant...  
  
**Erice:**   
...won't be considered an insult to all the Heroic Spirits!  
  
**Marie:**   
Then I want you to do something for me:  
hold your head high, and live your life with pride.  
  
**Erice:**   
Your Majesty...  
I want to believe I can. I do!  
  
**Erice:**   
But, the fact is...I'm cursed.  
I mean, you saw my terrible power for yourself!  
  
**Marie:**   
Yes, I did.  
I could tell it was very powerful magical energy.  
  
**Erice:**   
It's the power of death itself. Honestly, it still frightens me. It's what caused this whole disaster in the first&ndash;  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Grrrrrrrrr!  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh? Koyo?  
  
**Marie:**   
Even I could tell what she was saying there.  
  
**Marie:**   
You were warning us to be careful, weren't you?  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Rrr!  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm picking up some magical energy signals.  
Senpai, I think these might be&ndash;  
  
**Voyager:**   
I don't like this. I've never seen those things before!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are these...the darkness?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Did those things come from Dark Marie herself!?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Enemies straight ahead of the tram!  
Fortunately, we should be able to fight our way past them!  
  
**Mash:**   
Get ready, Sen&ndash;I mean, Master!  
Here they come now!  
  
＄94-04-78-25-1-1  
  
**Mash:**   
...The battle is over.  
All the...um, imps have been destroyed.  
  
**Mash:**   
But this is still only a taste of things to come, Senpai.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So we've got evil creatures bubbling up from the darkness...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If we don't stop them, those things'll swallow up the whole city.

**Mash:**   
Right. At worst...  
  
**Mash:**   
...we could lose the entire Monde du Jeu,  
which is inextricably linked to Erice...  
  
**Erice:**   
...Exactly.  
  
＄94-04-78-25-2-0  
  
**Erice:**   
...You guys should go back to Chaldea.  
  
**Mash:**   
Huh? Where did that come from?  
  
**Erice:**   
You still have that special space probe piece Voyager gave you, right? All you have to do is give it back to him.  
  
**Erice:**   
That should announce your intentions to quit the game and let you leave this place.  
  
**Erice:**   
It'd be the smart way to beat this game. Am I wrong?  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**Erice:**   
I'm gonna go on ahead alone. Really, when you get right down to it, this whole thing is my problem to solve, anyway.  
  
**Erice:**   
Now go on, hand your piece over and&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not happening.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hell no. We didn't come this far just to give up.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh? Why not?  
How can you be so blasé about&ndash;  
  
**Mash:**   
Because that's just who Senpai is, Erice.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Plus, I am technically the Master of Chaldea and all.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I want to help you, Erice. I mean it.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
...Stop it. Quit teasing me!  
This is my mess to clean up!  
  
**Erice:**   
You guys have much bigger things to worry about,  
right!? So go back and take care of them already!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I can't leave without doing something about the threat Dark Marie poses.  
  
**Erice:**   
You... You don't have to worry about that!  
I'm the one who needs to face her!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There are still other Servants here that need saving.  
  
**Erice:**   
Ah! That's right... There are, aren't there?  
  
**Erice:**   
And there's no guarantee they'll come back  
if you forfeit your player status...  
  
**Erice:**   
...or that they'll ever be able  
to escape from their tokens...  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not to mention you, Erice.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't forget, you're a Servant, too.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Right... B-but then...  
  
**Erice:**   
If I'm a Servant...then who summoned me...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't know what led to your being here. Not yet, anyway.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't know, but I hope it was me.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
I said stop it! What are you, stupid!?  
  
**Erice:**   
Like...what right would someone like me have to be in Chaldea, among all those amazing Heroic Spirits? I mean, ME...?  
  
**Erice:**   
It's impossible! There's no way I'd ever fit in there!  
Even in a million years, I could never&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's right. You're just like me. That's why I want to help you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Believe me, I get it. It's why I can't just leave you all on your own.  
  
---  
  
**Marie:**   
Erice?  
  
**Erice:**   
Khh... (Sniff)...  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**Mash:**   
If the Monde du Jeu is destroyed, it would almost  
certainly affect your existence, too.  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Grah! Rrr!  
  
**Erice:**   
K-Koyo...  
  
**Marie:**   
You're the one who guided us this far, aren't you, Voyager?  
  
**Marie:**   
You brought us together so that we could  
help Erice find her way again.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Not exactly.  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh?  
  
**Voyager:**   
I just showed you the way.  
  
**Voyager:**   
What happens next is up to  
Fujimaru and Erice.  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm afraid  
more evil creatures are headed our way!  
  
**Mash:**   
Ready to begin the exorcisms  
whenever you're ready, Senpai!  
  
＄94-04-78-25-2-1  
  
**Mash:**   
We've defeated all the enemies in sight.  
However&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah. No way that's the last of them.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah. I'm sure we're just getting started.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right, Master.  
We need to find where they're originating&ndash;  
  
**Marie:**   
You mean the other me? Yes, we do, or else this whole town will be swallowed up in darkness.  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
GrrrRRRrrr!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go find our other friends.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Friends... Right...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
After all, we're&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai! None of us is here alone.  
We have so many good friends here with us!  
  
＄94-04-78-25-3-0  
  
**Ganesha:**   
Damn! There's a ton of those things  
parading around in broad daylight!  
  
**Ganesha:**   
Kabukicho's a heartbeat away form having to be completely quarantined! We'd better do something now, before the darkness does irreparable damage!  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
#### Exorcist squad, move out!  
  
**Nightingale:**   
This is the exorcist squad, moving to the designated area now. Standing by for further instructions!  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
We shall take no prisoners today.  
Exorcise all evil spirits on sight!  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
That aside, I wonder what caused these vile imps to erupt from the underworld in such great numbers?  
  
**Osakabehime:**   
Hey guys, did you find which summoning  
gate they're coming from yet?  
  
**Moriarty:**   
I'm working on it as we speak, but I'm afraid my poor back picked a hell of a time to start acting up!  
  
**Chen Gong:**   
Now that things have come to this, I'm afraid you'll just have to make do. If sacrifices must be made, then so be it.  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Oh, it's you again. How is it you always seem to show  
up before I even realize you're here? ...And why,  
pray tell, are you looking at me like that!?  
  
**Reines:**   
Both of you, shut up. You're ruining the scenery.  
  
**Reines:**   
As tacticians, it's incumbent upon us to know  
when and where we need to be at all times.  
  
**Chen Gong:**   
My, my, you certainly are staring at that map intently, Lady Reines. What an elegant portrait you paint.  
  
**Reines:**   
Considering the only strategy you know is “everybody dies,” yes, my strategies tend to be a bit more elegant.  
  
**Moriarty:**   
Indeed, these sorts of grand events don't come along every day. Best to enjoy them while we can.  
  
**Osakabehime:**   
Welp, so much for those guys being any help. I know delegating can be hard but they're just being bakas. Zero stars, would not do business with again.  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
Indeed. I think it would be for the best if we handled the intel gathering ourselves.  
  
**Ganesha:**   
All right, let's see if we can't  
put together some solid meta.  
  
**Osakabehime:**   
Shall I whip up a quick wiki?  
  
**Osakabehime:**   
Oh, hang on, I'm getting a call.  
Yeees? Who is iiit?  
  
**Mash:**   
This is Mash Kyrielight.  
I'm here with Master Fujimaru.  
  
**Mash:**   
I have an important report to make regarding the source of these evil creatures!  
  
**Erice:**   
...You mean the Chaldean Servants  
are all working together?  
  
**Erice:**   
Did you order them to, Fujimaru?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wasn't me.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
When would I have had the time?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Then, they're doing it all of their own volition?  
That's amazing.  
  
**Mash:**   
Well, part of it does have to do with the fact that they all got caught up in this new game to begin with, so...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hey, it's not like these side-story events are anything new for us.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't forget that some of them just like this kind of stuff.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Oh man, all these cultural differences are seriously throwing me for a loop. Maybe I really can't fit in...  
  
**Voyager:**   
You can do it, Erice. I know you can.  
  
**Erice:**   
Voyager...  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Grrrrrrrrr!  
  
**Erice:**   
There are more evil creatures headed this way?  
Thanks for the heads-up, Koyo.  
  
**Erice:**   
Fujimaru, can I join Chaldea's response team, too?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
I don't know if this'll count as facing myself...  
but I'll make it work, one way or another.  
  
**N：Erice:**   
I'm sure the evil spirits inside me aren't  
gonna be too happy about this...  
  
**N：Erice:**   
...but nothing and nobody is getting  
sullied here on my watch!  
  
＄94-04-78-25-4-0  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice's Noble Phantasm has been released!  
It's even more powerful than I expected!  
  
**Mash:**   
Wait. Is it because you and her share a magical  
energy connection now, Master?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't think so.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No, I'm pretty sure this is all her.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Then, is it because Erice is no longer doubting herself? If so, that bodes extremely well for the upcoming battles!  
  
**Erice:**   
Do you really think so? I mean, this power of mine is the same darkness threatening Shinjuku right now.  
  
**Erice:**   
If it turns out these evil creatures are actually coming from inside me, then&ndash;  
  
**Marie:**   
Are you still having trouble coming to terms with it?  
  
**Erice:**   
...I'm not sure myself.  
But...  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**Mash:**   
...  
  
**Erice:**   
As terrible as my power might be, it can still be useful. That's good enough for me.  
  
**Erice:**   
Come on, Fujimaru. Let's get going.  
  
**Erice:**   
I want you to help me drive this evil out of my foolish self.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You got it.  
  
**Erice:**   
Thank you!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You really are strong, aren't you?  
  
**Erice:**   
Never mind that now!  
  
---  
  
＄94-04-78-25-4-1  
  
**C：Erice:**   
Phew...  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**C：Erice:**   
Do you think I did a good job?  
  
**Voyager:**   
I do. I'm relieved, Erice.  
  
**C：Erice:**   
Oh good...  
  
**C：Erice:**   
But I couldn't have done this without  
you guiding me, Voyager. Thank you.  
  
**C：Erice:**   
Still, this isn't over yet, is it?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Nope.  
  
**C：Erice:**   
Then we'd all better keep moving.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Yeah.  
  
**Babbage:**   
This is Charles Babbage with the transport team.  
  
**Babbage:**   
We've successfully taken control of the local tube,  
and are ready to supply other teams with talismans  
and exorcism spells.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
This is Henry Jekyll with the research team.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
We've just completed production on our  
first round of anti-evil spirit items.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
I'd like you to double-check the inventory list yourself to be sure, but I can tell you we've got three thousand handmade talismans and one thousand amulets.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
We're also working as fast as we can to deploy enough golems to bring everything where it's needed. At this rate, we should be able to cover everyone in all of Shinjuku.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Unfortunately, there are so many kinds of evil spirits that our individual analyses are having trouble keeping pace.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
And that's not even getting into the root  
cause that's making them all in the first&ndash;  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Khh! No, not now.  
We need brains to win this battle, not brawn!  
  
**Paracelsus:**   
Then we'd better hurry the analysis, development, and production along. Any chance we can work in parallel?  
  
**Sanzang:**   
Hey, don't you think I'd be more help on the front line than back here behind the scenes!?  
  
**Paracelsus:**   
Yes, I do, but I'm afraid we're too short on Eastern spirit exorcism experts to spare you.  
  
**Sanzang:**   
There's nothing special about it. You've just gotta give them a good smack! And if that doesn't work, use a golden headband to give their noggin a good squeeze!  
  
**Paracelsus:**   
Well, then do you think you could hurry up with developing the headbands?  
  
**Sanzang:**   
Oh, right. Sorry!  
The Buddha'll take care of it!  
  
**Avicebron:**   
Just keep working.  
Right now, that's all we can do.  
  
**Avicebron:**   
We also need a way to get these exorcism gear to where it's needed. Unfortunately, my golems are a bit inflexible in that regard, but...  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Hey, hey! Hippogriff Home Delivery, at your service!  
I'll get that talisman where it needs to go♪  
  
**M：Shinjuku Resident:**   
Thank you!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
No problemo!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Hurry up, Stolfo! This isn't a game!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Ugh, don't you think I know that, Bradamante?  
You don't have to rush me.  
  
**M：Shinjuku Resident:**   
#### Eeeeee!  
  
**Jack:**   
Don't be scared.  
We're just gonna put this sticker on you.  
  
**M：Shinjuku Resident:**   
Aaah!  
  
**M：Shinjuku Resident:**   
...Huh. I guess she was telling the truth.  
But what was her deal, anyway?  
  
**M：Shinjuku Resident:**   
...You know, this seal looks kind of creepy.  
And there's something written on it with a brush...  
  
**Yang Guifei:**   
If I hand them out like this, I think I can put them on lots of people at once. Fly, little talismans, fly!  
  
**Miyu:**   
Stop scattering our precious talismans, Yu-Yu!  
We need all of them!  
  
**Chloe:**   
Here goes!  
  
**Paris:**   
Yah!  
  
**Ishtar:**   
Give it up!  
  
**Tell:**   
Don't move.  
  
**Tell:**   
...You know, I still have a hard time believing these talisman things can really drive these creatures off.  
  
**Bartholomew:**   
This is Bartholomew Roberts with the nautical team.  
  
**Bartholomew:**   
We've just finished sealing off the Mosaic Sea and all the rest of Shinjuku's waterways.  
  
**Bartholomew:**   
So far, still no luck finding any leads on Dark  
Queen Marie, the source of this black mist.  
  
**Bartholomew:**   
We'll continue to coordinate between  
ships to monitor the situation.  
  
**Bartholomew:**   
I repeat: we still have no leads on  
the whereabouts of Dark Queen Marie.  
  
**Bartholomew:**   
We'll continue to coordinate between  
ships to monitor the situation.  
  
**Bartholomew:**   
Phew. Now, where in the world could she be hiding?  
She can't possibly have slipped past everyone.  
  
**Bartholomew:**   
After all, if she looks just like Queen Marie,  
then she's gotta be just as beautiful.  
  
**Bartholomew:**   
Maybe even more so, since she must be styling her bangs the way that was all the rage back in the royal court.  
  
**Illya:**   
#### Hold it!  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
...How rude. Didn't your parents ever  
teach you how to speak to strangers?  
  
**Illya:**   
You're the culprit&ndash;the gate bringing all these monsters in, aren't you!? Cut it out right this instant!  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Silence, commoner.  
Go back to the gutters you came from.  
  
**Illya:**   
Aaah! Ruby, help!  
  
**Ruby:**   
Okay, but I really don't think we're qualified to handle someone like this!  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Hehe... Hehehehe!  
  
**Illya:**   
This is Illya! I found her! Wait!  
What're you...? Heeelp! Somebody help meee!  
  
＄94-04-78-25-6-0  
  
**Mash:**   
Are you okay, Illya!?  
  
**Illya:**   
Yes, I'm fine! Thank you!  
  
**Marie:**   
Where'd the other me go!?  
  
**Illya:**   
That way!  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Grrr?  
  
**Erice:**   
Don't worry, Koyo.  
We'll find her.  
  
**Erice:**   
Right, Voyager?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Uh-huh. She wants us to follow her.  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Rrr...  
  
**Mash:**   
What's wrong, Koyo?  
Why you look so sad?  
  
**Erice:**   
...Come on.  
We need to find her before anyone else does.  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
This is Underworld Countermeasures HQ.  
We have located the summoning gate, Dark Marie.  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
Response team, ops members,  
move in and wrap this up ASAP.  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
I repeat: we have located the  
summoning gate, Dark Marie.  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice and Dark Marie are facing off...!  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Took you long enough.  
  
**Erice:**   
I've still got time.  
  
**Erice:**   
In fact, I had so much time to think that I realized a few things...  
  
**Erice:**   
...including who you really are, Queen&ndash;other Marie.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
I could have told you that, Erice.  
In fact, I already did.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Now do you know what I meant when I said I was you?  
  
**Erice:**   
...Yes, you are me. I see that clearly now.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
Take a good look at me. Take a look at this cursed form dripping with dark blood.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
Take a look at these horrific evil spirits  
whose hunger will never be satisfied.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
They feed on hope and dreams of the future. And if they can't have that, they'll settle for my soul.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
That's why they're drawn to me&ndash;because I'm an easy target. At least, that's what I thought.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
I didn't know who I was.  
I never tried to find out.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
All I knew was that I was the only person in the world born without a Holy Grail, and with no bonded Servant.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
Looking back now, I don't know how I could have ever believed I was just an ordinary human girl.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
I guess that's just what I wanted to believe.  
And even more than that...  
  
**I：Erice:**   
...I didn't want to know the truth.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
I wanted to think that the evil spirits just showed up out of nowhere. That they came to haunt me, possess me, and consume me.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
Because as long as I could convince myself of that...  
  
**I：Erice:**   
...I could remain a pure, ordinary, flesh and blood human.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
Maybe I could have even gone on convincing myself I was just like everyone else.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
But now that you're here, Marie,  
I can't ignore the truth any longer.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
It's true; you ARE me.  
Or rather, you're something that came from me.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
There's no way you could have known  
about me and Louis otherwise.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
You knew everything because you lived through everything I did. You knew my foolishness, and my weaknesses, even better than I did.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
Yes, Marie, you're me.  
And you're an evil, impure spirit that came from me.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
All these evil spirits are me.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
They've been bubbling up from deep inside my flesh,  
my blood, my bones, and my guts this entire time.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
They didn't just show up out of nowhere.  
They were born from me, created by me.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
I didn't want to believe it.  
I didn't want to accept it.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
But now that I've met, and looked up to you, Marie...  
I finally realized the truth.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
You're me.  
And I'm you.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
We're not people. We're just things.  
Incomparably loathsome things!  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
...Good. It's about time you figured it out.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Now, come into my arms.  
Let me embrace you. Let me console you.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
You'll feel so much better once I've laid you to rest for good. No dream will ever disturb you, and you'll never again have to awaken all alone in the middle of the night.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
You can forget everything. All you have to do is let me consume you, until we are one and the same.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Now, come, Erice. Come to me!  
  
**I：Erice:**   
...No. No! I'm staying right here!  
And I'm going to change who I am!  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
What?  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Don't be ridiculous. There's nowhere else you could possibly go where you could&ndash;  
  
**I：Erice:**   
That's not true. There's still Chaldea!  
  
**Mash:**   
Erice...!  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Grrr!  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Chaldea?  
Is that some kind of joke?  
  
**I：Erice:**   
I'm serious.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
So you don't care if they treat you like just another tool?  
  
**I：Erice:**   
If even tools have wills of their own, doesn't that make them just as alive as anything else?  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Raaah!  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
You cheeky little brat! One more outburst,  
and I'll have you strung up for treason.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
Weren't you the one espousing a Servant revolution?  
Or was that entire speech just a ploy to lure me in?  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Silence!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hang on...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Didn't something like this happen at the werewolf house, too?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Did you remember something, Senpai?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Back when the werewolf attacked Gilles de Rais&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That night the werewolf went after d'Eon  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
...Now that you mention it,  
something did seem off about it.  
  
**Mash:**   
Each of Marie's loyal knights said something that called everything into question before they passed...  
  
**Mash:**   
That they'd found themselves lost without their  
accustomed roles as knights to fall back on.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why did Gilles, a villager, end up as werewolf food?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There has to be a reason the werewolf went after Gilles.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Come to think of it, Emiya said something about that, too!  
  
**Mash:**   
As I recall, he said the werewolf would go after d'Eon for the same reason it went after Gilles...  
  
**Mash:**   
What if that means d'Eon was struggling  
with the same problem Gilles was?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
If anything, I think they'd already made peace with it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If anything, I think they were already over it.  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
D'Eon knew they had no choice but to forego their real knighthood.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
D'Eon knew they had no choice but to commit to their role in the game.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right... And that decision led to  
the werewolf hunting them down.  
  
**Mash:**   
I thought Amadeus was the one who set Gilles and d'Eon up, but thinking about it now...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They weren't set up. They were cut loose.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They had to go because they were no longer useful as knights.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
...!  
So that's why the werewolf went after them?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It wasn't just them. Don't forget Sanson.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And Sanson.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
...Is that what happened to Amadeus, too?  
  
**Mash:**   
So, if someone cut them loose, then&ndash;  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Traitors deserve death. Insolent peons who don't know their place deserve penance.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
It's only natural, don't you think?  
  
**Mash:**   
Then, the real werewolf is&ndash;  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Me, yes.  
I'm the real werewolf.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
But so what?  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Sovereignty is far more powerful than any silly rules. No game can give you an excuse to ignore the authority of royalty.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Both Gilles and d'Eon overstepped their bounds  
when they abandoned their knightly duties.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Amadeus, at least, assessed the situation correctly, and remained loyal. That's why he had the good sense to choose death.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
But a peon giving his life for his queen is merely doing what is expected of him. It is hardly praiseworthy.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
I'm royalty, after all.  
  
**Marie:**   
Listening to you makes me think that only someone truly inhuman could stand to be royalty.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Of course. To be royalty is to be equal to a god.  
No ordinary human could possibly measure up.  
  
**Marie:**   
Well, I don't agree. At all.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Then go back to the Throne of Heroes, oh-so gracious Marie. Or Chaldea, if you don't like that.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
But you, Erice, you belong to me.  
You ARE me, after all.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
...No. I refuse. I've decided to live  
my life on my own terms.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
I wasn't asking. If you think you can get  
away from me, you're sorely mistaken.  
  
**I：Erice:**   
I'm not going anywhere!  
This city is my home&ndash;my battlefield!  
  
**I：Erice:**   
Voyager! Lend me your strength!  
I need you now more than ever!  
  
**Voyager:**   
Of course, Erice.  
I'll always be here for you.  
  
**Mash:**   
We can't sit this one out either, Senpai!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, we can't. This is it&ndash;the final battle!

**Dark Marie:**   
Aaah... Aaaaaaaaah...  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
How unbearably hideous...  
This isn't me. This isn't meee!!!  
  
**D：Erice:**   
(Huff...huff...)  
  
**Mash:**   
We did it! Dark Marie is fatally wounded!  
  
**Mash:**   
Her pseudo-spirit form is collapsing quickly!  
Now's our chance to finish her off!  
  
**Mash:**   
...Master? What is it, Master?  
You look pale...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Erice's Spirit Origin data just camepouring into my mind during the fight.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I know who...Erice really is now...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
...!  
Now I see.  
  
**Mash:**   
Your magical energy connection must have grown even stronger now that she's unleashed her true potential.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Hehe. So what? It's just another role you have to play.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
There are still chains tying you down... The destiny the Holy Grail gave you... All these rules of the grand game coiling around you like so many snakes.  
  
**Dark Marie:**   
Never forget, Erice.  
You're me...and I'm you...  
  
**D：Erice:**   
...I know that.  
  
**Erice:**   
But I still get to choose how I live my life.  
  
**Erice:**   
...Right, Fujimaru? Mash?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...That's right.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yup. It doesn't matter what duty you've been assigned.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
...Right, Erice.  
  
**Mash:**   
I believe we can all choose our own futures.  
I really do.  
  
**Erice:**   
Yeah... We can, can't we? But then...  
I don't think I found this way of living on my own.  
  
**Erice:**   
You're the one who guided me to it, Voyager.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I did.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Here, I think this is yours.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Voyager:**   
...  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
This is Underworld Countermeasures HQ. We can confirm that the summoning gate has disappeared.  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
We're declaring the operation a success, and are disbanding our team effective immediately. You have all fought bravely, and we thank you for that.  
  
**Tomoe Gozen:**   
I repeat, the operation is a success, and we are disbanding our team effective immediately. You have all fought bravely. Thank you.

**Mash:**   
...The stars are fading from view as each game is back in its respective box.  
  
**Mash:**   
All the Servants have been temporarily tokenized to fit inside the boxes as well.  
  
**Mash:**   
Our Monde du Jeu adventure will soon be over.  
Part of me's going to miss it.  
  
**Mash:**   
...Um, Senpai?  
There's still one thing I'm concerned about.  
  
**Mash:**   
How do we get back home?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh... Good question...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
D-do you think we can?  
  
**Mash:**   
We've lost contact with Da Vinci again, so&ndash;  
Huh?  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai, look! These are Edison and Emiya's tokens!  
  
**Mash:**   
What are they doing all the way out here?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Things did get pretty rough for them. At least they're okay...I think.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe they got worried and came here to check up on us.  
  
---  
  
**Marie:**   
I do hope you'll tell me all about what  
happened once we get back to Chaldea.  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh, right. We're still trying to figure  
out the getting back part, aren't we?  
  
**Erice:**   
Don't worry. We've got Voyager here.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Hi, Nursery. You're here too, huh?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Uh-huh. I'll make sure you get home.  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh, right! Of course Voyager can get us back home safely!  
  
**Erice:**   
...  
  
**Voyager:**   
Is everybody ready?   
  
**Mash:**   
I think so! I've got Edison, Emiya, and  
Nursery's tokens all safely tucked away.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Okay then, here we go.  
  
**Marie:**   
I see. So we all hold hands with Voyager in the middle. Here, Koyo, I'll hold your talons.  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Grr!  
  
**Marie:**   
You too, Erice. Let me have your hand.  
  
**Erice:**   
Ah...  
  
**Marie:**   
Oh my, you poor thing. You're trembling.  
I guess you're still second-guessing yourself, huh?  
  
**Erice:**   
Queen Marie...  
  
**Marie:**   
Well, I can't say I blame you. You're about to be reborn, after all. And I'm sure there will be plenty of other times in the future when you will lose your way.  
  
**Marie:**   
But don't forget.  
  
**Marie:**   
If nothing else, the Master your current materialization is about to forge a bond with?  
  
**Marie:**   
[♂ He'll /♀️ She'll] definitely let you live the kind of  
life you want to lead. One you can be proud of.  
  
**Erice:**   
A bond...  
  
**Erice:**   
...Um, to be perfectly honest, Fujimaru...  
  
**Erice:**   
That part still doesn't feel real even now,  
standing here looking right at you, but...  
  
**Erice:**   
...I think I can finally believe it now that I'm seeing the bonds you have with Queen Marie and Mash.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's okay. I get it.  
  
**Erice:**   
H-how can you be so nice?  
Isn't being that trusting kind of...  
  
**Erice:**   
On second thought, never mind.  
Forget I said anything.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So you couldn't believe it before? Ouch...  
  
**Erice:**   
Ah... I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.  
  
**Erice:**   
You're so different from the stereotypical mage that, well, yeah, I'll have to properly apologize to you later.  
  
---  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Grrrrrrrrr!  
  
**Erice:**   
Huh? Koyo?  
  
**Marie:**   
That sounded serious. What did she say?  
  
**Erice:**   
She...wished me luck on my new journey...and said that death is also the first step on a path of new life.  
  
**Erice:**   
Thank you, Koyo.  
  
**Erice:**   
You're right. That's exactly what this was:  
a rite of passage for death and rebirth.  
  
**Marie:**   
Death is the start of a new life, huh. That feels especially poignant for Servants like us.  
  
**Marie:**   
You might well end up seeing the end of the world  
someday. But afterwards, something new might come  
from that.  
  
**Erice:**   
...Something new after the world ends?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I hope you get to see it.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
...I once promised Voyager I would  
bring something to an end.  
  
**Erice:**   
Looks like it's back to square one on that.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I won't forget, Erice.  
  
**Erice:**   
It's okay if you do, Voyager.  
Better to travel lightly, after all.  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai, look! The starlight is getting even dimmer!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Come on, Erice.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go home to Chaldea.  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
Yeah. There's no point in staying here.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Okay, get ready for liftoff!  
  
**Voyager:**   
We're going to the place Erice chose to be...  
  
**Mash:**   
...We're back!  
It's so good to be home again!  
  
**Erice:**   
Chaldea... So this is the place I chose...  
  
**Voyager:**   
Um... (Tug, tug)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, right. I didn't give this back yet, did I?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Here you go, Voyager.  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
No, not that...  
  
**Mash:**   
What the...!?  
The game piece just turned into a Holy Grail!  
  
**Voyager:**   
This is what brought Erice and me together. Now that the game is over, it went back to its original form.  
  
**Voyager:**   
I want you to have it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Me?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But, doesn't this belong to Erice?  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
It's okay. After all, Erice&ndash;  
  
**Erice:**   
You mean, I already had my wish granted?  
  
**Erice:**   
...I always did admire Servants more than anything, and I guess, deep down, I always wanted the honor of being one.  
  
**Erice:**   
But I also felt really ashamed for wanting such an honor when I knew I didn't deserve it.  
  
**Erice:**   
I think that explains why I subconsciously chose a game like that for my trial.  
  
**Erice:**   
Maybe that other Queen Marie even showed up as  
a bad guy because it's what I secretly wanted.  
  
**Erice:**   
Because I thought she'd be the right person to punish me...  
  
**Marie:**   
That's exactly why you had to stand up to her yourself.  
  
**Erice:**   
You're right, Your Majesty.  
  
**Erice:**   
Although, um, I still feel really bad that I ended  
up putting you in that position...  
  
**Marie:**   
Don't be, Erice. You did overcome her,  
and I for one couldn't be happier for you.  
  
**Erice:**   
Your Majesty...!  
  
**Mash:**   
And, now that you've had your wish granted, I'm so glad that you're going to stay with us as a Servant!  
  
**Erice:**   
...To be honest, I'm still a little unsure if I really belong here.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm just gonna hold onto this, okay?  
  
---  
  
**Erice:**   
...Yeah, of course. By all means.  
  
**Erice:**   
You, um, are my Master, after all.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Thank goodness.  
  
**Voyager:**   
See? I've been looking for a bright,  
shiny star...just for Erice.  
  
**Voyager:**   
And you turned out to be the best  
star I could have hoped for.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Right back at you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thanks for everything, Voyager.  
  
---  
  
**Voyager:**   
I'll never forget you.  
  
**Erice:**   
Voyager?  
  
**Voyager:**   
But now, I have to go.  
  
**Voyager:**   
This was like a bit, biiig swing-by,  
and it's time to get back to my journey.  
  
**Mash:**   
Voyager...  
Thank you.  
  
**Erice:**   
...Voyager, wait!  
Can't you stay just a little longer!?  
  
**Voyager:**   
It's okay, Erice.  
You have a new job here, just like I do.  
  
**Voyager:**   
Come on, Koyo.  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Rrr...  
  
**Erice:**   
Not you too, Koyo!?  
  
**Voyager:**   
Uh-huh. We're going together.  
I'm sure you knew that.  
  
**Erice:**   
Well...yeah, but still!  
  
**Erice:**   
Chaldea's a whole other world, and this isn't even the time period we're from. Not to mention Koyo's originally from the much more distant past.  
  
**Erice:**   
I figured you guys would at least go back to the Throne, regardless of what happened in Akihabara...  
  
**Erice:**   
But this isn't&ndash;  
  
**Voyager:**   
I thought you weren't going to cry anymore?  
  
**Erice:**   
...Who, me? Of course not!  
  
**Voyager:**   
Good.  
  
**Kijyo Koyo:**   
Rrrrrr!  
  
**Erice:**   
Voyager... Koyo...  
  
**Erice:**   
Goodbye. Bon voyage.  
See you later.  
  
**Erice:**   
...At least, I hope we can see each other again.  
Maybe...just maybe...  
  
**Marie:**   
So that darling boy and beautiful woman are gone now, huh?  
  
**Mash:**   
Hm? The whole place fell into complete silence,  
but now it's so lively again all of a sudden.  
  
**Mash:**   
It looks like all the Servants were  
released from their tokens!  
  
**Erice:**   
...Well, um, maybe this is a good  
time to properly introduce myself?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Welcome to Chaldea, Erice. We're glad to have you.
