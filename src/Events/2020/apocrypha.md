# Apocrypha/Inheritance of Glory  
   
## Prelude  
   
**Narration:**   
Seven against seven.  
Finally, at long last, they are all gathered.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
No Ruler has been summoned here. This Great Holy Grail War will have no effect on the world.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
The “other” Ruler is not here either.  
He is already dead.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
He will never be sent here as a new Ruler now.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
In which case, this tiny, insignificant world that miraculously managed to remain...is mine.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Yes, this is my world now.  
It belongs to no one else.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
So I will repeat the cycle as many times as it takes. I will recreate the miracle, and this time I will ascend to glory.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
In the end, that is all I can do, all I can become.  
And so, I have no choice but to proceed.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Oh. I'm dreaming.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oh, we're doing this again, huh?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Answer me... Answer me...  
Hear my call...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Hear my call, and answer me...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who is this...?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Hear me, O feeble mortal... Thou art the one who clears the path for destiny... Hear my call, and answer me.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I guess I'm falling now? Or maybe just lost?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Either way, it definitely feels like I'm falling from a huge height. I flail my arms and legs around...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...and end up sinking into a sea of darkness.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Awaken, Master of Chaldea...  
The great Master who answered my call...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Great?  
   
**Narration:**   
Er, yeah. You&ndash;I mean, you DID restore humanity, didn't you? That certainly seems great to me...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Call?  
   
**Narration:**   
Yup, that's wh&ndash;Er, rather...  
Forsooth, great Master who hath answered my call...  
  
   
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...  
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...  
...Master of Chaldea...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Has thou regained thy sense?  
Canst thou see how many fingers I do hold before thee?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Welp, that settles it!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oh, yeah, so I AM dreaming!  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Yea, thou art correct. This is but a dream.  
However, it is also quite real.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I summoned thee hither with this Holy Grail,  
while thou yet slumbered...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
It is a complicated matter to explain, but perhaps it would be best if thou thought of thyself as a sort of mental projection of thine own form.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Thy flesh and blood body...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...should yet slumber aboard the Shadow Border,  
continuing thy journey.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...This world is in great peril, and to survive, it will need your&ndash;er, thy help. It will need THY help. Forsooth.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you mean this is a job for Chaldea, huh?  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Thou dost seem perhaps TOO accustomed to this sort of thing.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Of course, that must be exactly why it was thee,  
among all, who was summoned here.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm sorry, who are you again?  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...My name is Fafnir. I am the evil dragon who once made off with the miracle of humankind.  
  
   
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
So, what sayest thou?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh, what if I say no?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm guessing I can't leave until I solve this?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Nay, shouldst thou choo&ndash;ugh... Nope.  
You can refuse if you want. If you do, that's that.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...Yeah...  
I should've known.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
It was incredibly arrogant of me to call you here out of nowhere and ask you to fight.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Don't worry about it. I'll figure something else out.  
I'm terribly sorry to have bothered you like this.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's so considerate... Tell me what's going on.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I want to know everything that's happening here.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...I see.  
Very well then, I shall start at the beginning.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...This is more complicated than I thought...  
Hold on, let me just get everything straight...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's okay. I'm not going anywhere.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...Uh, first off, let me explain where you are right now.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
This is the Reverse Side of the World. Hmm, or maybe a hidden place on “the other side,” so to speak, is more accurate?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Basically, you can think of it as a mythical land and the home of magical beasts.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Your world, the human world,  
is built on human laws.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...This world, however,  
is entirely removed from those laws.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
This may be difficult to understand, but your world came to exist once humanity had covered the entire planet, like a cloth.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
But before that could happen,  
beings called Phantasmals fled here.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Of course, I hear that Phantasmals have been showing up in your world again as well, now that humanity is in such disorder.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry to interrupt, but...you mean like wyverns?  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Yes, that's right.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Phantasmals? Like what?  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Wyverns, bicorns, chimeras...  
Creatures like that.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
They're supposed to live here, in this world, though. They shouldn't be visiting yours as though it were some sort of café.  
  
   
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Now, this land is in grave danger,  
thanks to the Greater Grail I brought here.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Greater Grail...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
As in, the one that was in Fuyuki...?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
You really DO know your stuff.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I don't know what happened in your world, but in mine,  
I had no choice but to bring the Greater Grail here to the Reverse Side.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Otherwise it would have caused all kinds of problems, you see.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
There was a problem, though. A certain Noble Phantasm partially destroyed the Greater Grail.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Even so, things were fine until now...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...but then, even though I didn't do anything,  
it just kind of...broke. On its own.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Suuure it did.  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
No, really, I didn't do anything.  
I'm sure I didn't...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I may have a few gaps in my memory, but I'm fairly certain nothing happened during those gaps.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You expect me to believe that!?  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...I mean...I don't think I did, anyway.  
I'll admit my memory is a little hazy, but even so...  
  
   
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
A-at any rate, the real problem...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...is that a Holy Grail War is taking place inside the damaged Greater Grail.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did you say...a Holy Grail War...?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Yup.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
A miniature war between Servants is being waged inside the very Greater Grail they want to control.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I haven't actually seen any of the battles myself, but I know how many there have been. Just looking at the numbers here, it's been over ten thousand now.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
At first there were only two Servants. By the 567th Holy Grail War, there were four, and by the 2313th, there were seven.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...That was when my control of the Greater Grail started to waver.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
That is to say, someone is trying to take over the Greater Grail and use it for themselves.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
If something isn't done, the Greater Grail will continue to spin out of control until it's completely destroyed.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
And that would be...a problem.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Problem?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Yes, a big problem. You see, this Greater Grail isn't mine. I'm just holding on to it.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I don't have any right to use it myself,  
and I can't let anyone else use it either.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I have to take good care of it.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
If the Greater Grail went out of control, that would cause a great deal of trouble for all the Demonic Beasts who live here...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
It's even possible that an event like that, or its aftermath, could damage one of the anchors that holds the world together.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
If the cloth&ndash;or texture, if you like&ndash;is torn, the laws of physics will be turned on their heads, and the Age of Gods will end up mixing with modern times.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
And that...wouldn't end well for anybody. Humans and Demonic Beasts would only end up hurting each other.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
So I'm asking you now:  
Will you help me save this world?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Okay, I'll give it a shot.  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Really...!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If there's something I can do to help...  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...!  
  
   
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Thank you!!!  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]][[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]][[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
?  
???  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...Are you okay?  
Is something wrong?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Gesture at your ears)  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...I'm so sorry.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
It's been so long since I actually spoke that I've forgotten how to do it at an appropriate volume.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Write on the ground)  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Oh, I see. I'm sorry.  
I guess I got a little carried away...  
  
   
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Ahem. Very well then, Let me try that again:  
I want you to ride on my back.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
We'll need to dive into the domain within the Greater Grail itself.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So...I'm gonna get to be a dragon rider!?  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Yes. You may be the first to do so since humanity began using the Gregorian calendar.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oh man, I'm gonna get to be a dragoon!  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Ah, that is a popular misconception. A “dragoon,”  
I am afraid, is not one who rides a dragon.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Though I do admit,  
it has a very nice ring to it.  
  
   
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Anyway, just climb up and grab one of my scales. Now, hold on... This will be my first flight in over ten years!  
  
   
## Section 1: Dive, Inner World  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
As I thought, Trifas has been recreated...along with the Assassin of Red's Hanging Gardens.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I'm surprised this world has been crafted with such detail, though... Who could have done this, and what could they be after?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry, what's Trifas?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
A small city in Romania where a Great Holy Grail War took place. ...Hmm. I see there are a number of Dragon Tooth Warriors and golems roaming about.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
But those should be no trouble.  
I'll just go ahead and burn them all.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That was amazing!  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Why thank you.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I shouldn't be too proud; this isn't something I trained hard to be able do or anything like that. Still, it's nice being complimented.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeowch, that's hot!  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Ah, sorry.  
I guess I got a little carried away...  
  
   
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
All right, let's just land here and then we'll&ndash;  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Uh oh...! There are Servants here...and they're wasting no time attacking us!  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Khh...!  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
This light...  
That's Vasavi Shakti!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Karna's Noble Phantasm!?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Ghh...  
Sorry! I'm going down...!  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...Are you all right...?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
More or less...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
My wings are pretty messed up.  
I won't be able to fly for a while.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I'm afraid I misjudged the situation...  
I'm so sorry.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So, those were Servants we just ran into?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...Not exactly.  
At least, not in the true sense of the word.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
If we define Servants as pseudo-reproductions of people who have become Heroic Spirits, then the beings that attacked us don't quite qualify.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
If anything, they're more like...  
Well, zombies, or maybe mecha.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
They're about as strong as Servants, but they have no emotions, and can't think for themselves.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Still, as tiny as this world is, I never thought they'd be able to reproduce their Noble Phantasms...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They're coming!  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I'll stall them while you make your escape!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We've gotta get out of here!  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
That could be difficult.  
I'm not exactly nimble in this form...  
  
   
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Get to that fortress! You should be safe there.  
Then&ndash;  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Damn, looks like we're out of time!  
Why you...!  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
They're still coming...!  
Now what are they&ndash;  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
They even managed to recreate Balmung...!?  
Khh...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fafnir!  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Hurry, get out of here!  
If they get you too, it's all over!  
  
   
**???:**  
...Oh? It seems we have a special guest.  
  
   
**???:**  
What a surprise to see a real flesh-and-blood Master here.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who are you...?  
  
   
**???:**  
Custodian, let me take [♂ him /♀ her] off your hands.  
I promise I shall get [♂ him /♀ her] to safety.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Thank you. I'll catch up with you later!  
  
   
**???:**  
Okay, Master of Chaldea, get ready to run!  
  
   
**???:**  
Looks like we've got some Dragon Tooth Warriors to deal with. I will dispose of them.  
  
   
**???:**  
Oh, but first.  
  
   
**???:**  
Would you tell me your name, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm Fujimaru.  
  
   
**???:**  
All right, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru,  
please listen to me.  
  
   
**???:**  
First, we're going to head for that fortress.  
  
   
**???:**  
My name is Chiron. I'll be happy to take care of any enemies we run into along the way.  
  
   
**B：Chiron:**   
But to do that,  
I'll need someone to give me commands.  
  
   
**B：Chiron:**   
And that someone will be you, Master of Chaldea.  
  
   
**B：Chiron:**   
Now, let battle be joined!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Chiron:**   
That should do it.  
I'm glad this rescue was successful.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Now, let's get out of here, shall we?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What about Fafnir...?  
   
**Chiron:**   
Yes...he was just attacked with a number of Noble Phantasms...but he seems to be no worse for wear.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
No wonder he's been the one keeping care of the Holy Grail. He's certainly quite durable.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He still needs our help!  
   
**Chiron:**   
Not to worry.  
Another Servant will be along soon to help him.  
  
   
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Rider!  
The rest is up to you!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
All right, we'd best be on our way.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
It will be morning soon.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I'm not sure what you know about our current predicament...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...but I can explain that all once we are safe.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Come, let us hurry to the fortress.  
  
   
## Section 2: Defense: Millennia Fortress  
   
**Chiron:**   
It won't be long now.  
Soon, the dawn will break, and they will leave.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
That is, they will disappear.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
After that, we just have to hope that Rider did his job properly.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who is this Rider?  
   
**Chiron:**   
I'll tell you his True Name once he returns. First, I need to bring you up to speed on what has been happening here.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can you tell me what's going on?  
   
**Chiron:**   
Gladly. Once the morning comes,  
I will tell you everything I know.  
  
   
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...It's morning now.  
Rider should return shortly.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
You must be tired.  
Why don't we take a short break?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Would you like something to drink?  
Perhaps some coffee?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That would be great, thank you.  
   
**Chiron:**   
It may perhaps be a bit sweeter than you prefer...but I promise it will do wonders for your exhaustion.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So, everything's fine now that it's morning?  
   
**Chiron:**   
That's right. They disappear each morning.  
...Well, at six o'clock in the morning, to be exact.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
We only realized this around the 734th Holy Grail War.  
  
   
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Here you go.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ooh, this is delicious.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I'm glad you think so.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
So, what did the Custodian tell you when you first arrived here?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I can fill in anything he may have left out.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I see, I see...  
Very well then, let me explain everything else.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
To begin, this is not like a typical Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
It does not involve seven Masters trying to kill one another, nor even seven classes of Servants with which to do so.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...Ah, so you have no experience with that sort of Holy Grail War. Well, trust me when I say that that is usually how these things go.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Now I hope you're paying attention;  
this WILL be on the test.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Now, this Great Holy Grail War uses the Greater Grail's emergency system from Fuyuki to wage war with fourteen Servants rather than the customary seven.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
That is to say, it is a battle between two teams of seven Servants.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...However, that war had in fact already concluded,  
with Fafnir emerging as the apparent victor.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
That is how he came into possession of the Greater Grail.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
As for us, we are reproductions of the Servants who were summoned during that Great Holy Grail War.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Reproductions...?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
In this world, the only two places that exist are the city of Trifas, and of course the Hanging Gardens.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...I suppose you could call this a sort of simulation.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Aha. That seems to have helped you understand.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Indeed, this is all one enormous simulation field designed to recreate that Great Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
We were originally imitation life-forms, going through the motions of battle without thought or emotion.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
However, as this seemingly endless simulation repeated itself, something unexpected happened.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Namely, we developed intelligence, reason,  
and even regained our memories as Servants.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
That being said, we do not remember anything about the Great Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
You might say that I'm starting over from scratch.  
At least as a Servant.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
It's only in this tiny world that we become something close to real Servants.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Do you understand everything we've covered so far?  
If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What sort of enemy are we up against?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who is that dragon, anyway?  
   
  
   
**Chiron:**   
They are reproductions, just as we are. Unlike us, though, they have nothing in the way of intellect or reason...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...but what they do have are sheer numbers.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Of the fourteen Servants who were originally summoned to the Great Holy Grail War, we now face twelve.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That many!?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Yes, that many.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
As we are all starting from scratch, I'm afraid I don't know any of their True Names other than the Rider on our side...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...but I believe the evil dragon does.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who is that dragon, anyway?  
   
  
   
**Chiron:**   
His name is Fafnir.  
He seems to be this Greater Grail's Custodian.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
There is not a shred of doubt that he was the Great Holy Grail War's victor.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Though I'm afraid I have no idea how he secured his victory, or what he is doing in a place like this.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What sort of enemy are we up against?  
   
  
   
**Chiron:**   
As the Custodian, he would like this Greater Grail to stop simulating this war.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
By rights, we should be helping him...but unfortunately, our enemies are just too strong.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
What's more, we have not a moment to waste.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
The other Servants have learned how to use their Noble Phantasms, despite still lacking consciousness.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
And that brings us to the final stage of the tens of thousands of battles to the death we fourteen Servants have fought.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
We have no choice but to repeat this battle.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
And yet, the more we fight,  
the worse the situation becomes.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How did you and Rider become conscious?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
A good question.  
We wondered about that ourselves for a time...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
It is our belief now that the Custodian altered the simulation's parameters to make us into proper Servants.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
As the Greater Grail's Custodian, it should be well within his capabilities to recreate us in this world.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...Though it also seems he hesitated to do so until the very last moment.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Had he not, we may have had a few more allies on our side.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How about just not fighting?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I'm afraid that would be difficult.  
There is nowhere to seek refuge in this world.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Though you were fortunate enough to survive tonight,  
there is no telling what tomorrow may hold.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
They did not attack this fortress only because of the new, unexpected elements that you and Fafnir represent in the current situation.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Most likely, that was simply a function of the battle simulation program, rather than any thought or strategy on their part.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
But the next time will be different.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Next time, I expect they will account for Fafnir in their calculations, and mount an assault on this fortress.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then, what can we possibly&ndash;  
  
   
**C：???:**  
We fight till the end.  
What other choice is there?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
So you've returned, Rider.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Sure have, Teacher.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
So, this is...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm Fujimaru.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm the Master of Chaldea.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Hmm...  
Hmm, hmm, hmm.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
I see, I see.  
So you're one of those Master people!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Sorry to bring you here just when things couldn't get any worse.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um, excuse me, but...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I didn't catch your name.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Oh, right, sorry 'bout that.  
My True Name's Achilles.  
  
   
**C：Achilles:**   
You know about the Achilles tendon in your heel, right?  
That was named after me.  
  
   
**C：Achilles:**   
I'm the guy who was completely invincible, except for a spot on his heel. Then I freakin' died when that bastard Paris shot me there with an arrow.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, you mean this tendon?  
   
**Achilles:**   
Yup, that's the one.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Don't ever get stabbed there if you can help it.  
Hurts like hell.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Of course, what he didn't mention was that, after he was shot, he decided to go out in a blaze of glory, wiping out a whole squadron of enemy soldiers before finally taking his own life.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Hell yeah! I was pretty badass back then,  
if I do say so myself!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
I was like a writer suddenly getting a flash of inspiration the night before a big deadline.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Are you something of a scatterbrain?  
   
**Achilles:**   
What? No way!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Hahaha, I see you're an excellent judge of character, Master of Chaldea.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Right you are. He's surprisingly scatterbrained and quite absentminded.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
It's the one thing that hasn't changed a bit since he was alive.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Aw, come on!  
  
   
  
   
**Chiron:**   
At any rate... Achilles, what became of Fafnir?  
The Custodian?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
He's resting in the courtyard. Go check on him if you're worried about him, Master of Chaldea.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's beautiful here...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Indeed...  
Even if it is just an imitation of the real thing.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How badly are you hurt?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Quite badly, I'm afraid.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
The last Noble Phantasm I took the brunt of belonged to Siegfried...the Dragon-Slayer.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I'm afraid that, being a dragon,  
I am more vulnerable to that attack than most.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I never thought these reproductions would ever learn how to use their originals' Noble Phantasms...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
To make matters worse, we have only two Servants allied with us... Though at least they're two extremely powerful A-rank ones.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did you make them into Servants?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Yes, I did.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
The idea was to convert all fourteen reproductions into intelligent Servants and investigate who or what is making them fight...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...but that would have been a horrible decision.  
Besides, creating intelligent beings on a whim...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Such irresponsibility would have been too cruel.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
However, my hesitation has only ended up making the situation worse.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I never thought they could use their Noble Phantasms despite lacking the capacity for thought...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
So in a spur-of-the-moment decision, the best I could do was turn those two reproductions into Servants.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Even so, I'm afraid that does nothing to lessen my own sins.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I am too wounded to be able to move in this form for the time being.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
But I refuse to sit around doing nothing to help.  
I'm going to make a terminal so I can join you.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A terminal...?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Just a moment.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
...Mm, hmm.  
Ahh, ahh, ahh.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
...There we go. It feels good to be back to this height,  
and to have this voice back.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So, you're the terminal?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
That's right.  
This terminal's name is...Sieg.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
I'm afraid it can't do as much as my dragon body can, but at least this body can move.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...  
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So, what's going to happen to the dragon...?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
He'll just have to go to sleep for a while.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Well, I'm not able to split my consciousness across multiple bodies...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Still, I can at least use my dragon body's power.  
For brief moments, anyway.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I'm so sorry. Ever since I brought you here,  
I've caused you nothing but trouble.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Well, uh, in that case...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nice to meet you...again.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Oh, right!  
You want to shake hands. I remember now.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I hope I didn't squeeze too hard.  
I'm still getting used to this body.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Now then, I'd like to meet with the other Servant before nightfall.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
The Archer of Black, Chiron,  
is the wisest sage among the centaur.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
So if anyone can make a plan with the information I have, it's him.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Maybe even one that could defeat all twelve of the other Servants, including his former allies.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...I'll be blunt:  
there is no way we can win.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I see...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I guess twelve Servants is just too tall an order...?  
   
**Chiron:**   
Correct. We are simply outmatched.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Even if all three of you team up?  
   
**Chiron:**   
I'm afraid so.  
  
   
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I'm afraid that this was a conclusion I reached even taking you into account, Master of Chaldea.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Achilles, do you know anything about the Great Holy Grail War?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Not really. All I know is I saw someone who looked a lot like Vlad III during the battle.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Oh, I think I saw Atalante from the Calydonian Boar hunt too. Or at least, someone who matched my old man's description of her.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
But that's pretty much it.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
What about you, Sir Custodian?  
Do you know anything about the other Servants?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Of course.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
All fourteen Servants are divided into two teams,  
Black and Red.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
The Black team includes Siegfried, the Saber of Black...Vlad III, the Lancer of Black...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Astolfo, the Rider of Black...  
Avicebron, the Caster of Black...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Frankenstein, the Berserker of Black...  
and Jack the Ripper, the Assassin of Black.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
The Red team includes Mordred, the Saber of Red...  
Atalante, the Archer of Red...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Karna, the Lancer of Red...  
Shakespeare, the Caster of Red...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Spartacus, the Berserker of Red...  
and Semiramis, the Assassin of Red.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I see, I see. Thank you, Sir Custodian.  
You have an excellent memory.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Just call me Sieg.  
I'm not used to being called “Custodian.”  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
As you wish, Sir Sieg.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Anyway, I guess you have a point... We can't possibly fight all twelve of those Servants at once.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I guess I shouldn't have bothered trying to stop them from the outside...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Don't worry, Sir Sieg.  
I am just getting started.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Aw, crap. This is gonna be bad.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Now, let's begin this class properly, shall we?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
[♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Master of Chaldea,  
would you do the honors?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uhh... All rise!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Bow!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Be seated!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Wait. Why are we just sitting on the floor in the throne room?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I'm not actually certain myself, but...it seems to me this is more of a classroom right now.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Oh. Okay. Great.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Now then, our lesson for today will be...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
“How to Defeat All Twelve Black and Red Enemy Servants.”  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Wait, wait. I distinctly remember you saying that was impossible all of two minutes ago.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
And it is, were we to face all twelve together.  
So, what should we do then?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Use our Noble Phantasms to take them all out at once? No, that wouldn't work.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...Take them out one at a time?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Yes, now you're getting warmer. But it would be a waste of resources to focus on only one at a time.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
That would be like swatting a fly with a sledgehammer.  
Not to mention that the other eleven Servants are unlikely to simply wait patiently for their turn.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So...about three at a time?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Well done, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru.  
A gold star for you.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Achilles and I will team up to hold back nine of the Servants.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Bwa?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
In the meantime, the two of you will defeat the remaining three. Simple, right?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Are you kidding? That's absurd.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I assure you, it is not absurd in the slightest.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Whoa, whoa, whoa!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Hold on a minute, Teacher.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Having these two take out three Servants at once is absurd enough, but how are the two of us going to hold back the other nine while they do!?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Did you forget they can use their Noble Phantasms now!?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Of course not. But based on what I saw last night, they are very obvious about when they are going to do so.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
A Noble Phantasm is, after all,  
a weakness as much as a trump card.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
And right now, our enemies use them for no other reason than simply because they can.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
So you're saying you want us to anticipate when they're about to use their Noble Phantasms and...just dodge?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Correct. You may be a little green now, Sir Custodi&ndash;Sir Sieg, but by nightfall, I will have trained you to see the signs of an imminent Noble Phantasm.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I see.  
By nightfall, you say? Then, that means...  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
(Oh great. Here comes the crash course...  
I just know it.)  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Achilles... Achilles... I'm told you wish to become a great hero, and that you want to do so as fast as you possibly can.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
To be a hero, you will need good judgment and proper analytical faculties.  
  
   
**C：Eight-Year-Old Achilles:**   
Yes, Teacher!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I promise that once you complete these trials,  
you will be a full-fledged hero.  
  
   
**C：Eight-Year-Old Achilles:**   
Yay! That's what I want!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Then for the next twenty-four hours,  
from this moment onward...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...I want you to dodge every single one of my attacks.  
  
   
**C：Eight-Year-Old Achilles:**   
Bwa?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
(Next thing I knew, Chiron was shooting hundreds of arrows at me in that narrow cave. I still remember what he said...)  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
(“Don't worry! Once you can alter the trajectories of ten out of every hundred arrows, you'll be dodging all of them in no time!”)  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
(“It should be well within your capabilities thanks to that superhuman speed of yours!”)  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
(“Besides, none of them have arrowheads, so they won't kill you. They will just sting quite a lot!”)  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
(“What's that? You would actually prefer a more slow and steady approach instead? Hmm... I see...”)  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
(“I think that would suit me better as well.  
This is certainly not an ideal way to educate you.”)  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
(“However, since we have precious little time, we should spend it polishing this method to the fullest.”)  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Hey, Custod&ndash;I mean, Sieg?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Hm?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Just...don't die, okay?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Of course. I'll make sure I survive (both tonight and tomorrow night).  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Right on!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I get the feeling you two aren't quite on the same page...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Until now, the reproductions have simply come back to life whenever they are defeated.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
In a system like that,  
there can be neither failure nor victory.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
But now that the Greater Grail's Custodian, Sir Sieg, and [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru, the observer, are here...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...there is a very good chance that we can break this stalemate.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
[♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru, why don't you get some sleep? You will need to be well rested for tonight's battle.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay, will do.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm exhausted...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So...sleepy...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Again.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Again.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Again, again, again.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Come, let us battle to the death.  
Let us fight, and grow purer.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Go forth and recreate that battle,  
for it still has yet to be settled.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Recreate, recreate, recreate...and then,  
I will obtain what I seek.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Still afternoon, huh...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
THAT was a weird dream...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
(Huff, huff, huff...)  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Oh, are you up already, Master?  
We still have some time before the battle begins.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Hmm. You still have a ways to go, Sir Sieg,  
but I suppose we can take a short break.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Thank...you...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you okay!?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
More or less.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Chiron was kind enough to stop before he actually killed me.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
In the meantime, Achilles and I will set about preparing our trap.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What trap?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
A Bounded Field, to make it easier to separate our enemies.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Specifically, to cut off the nine Servants Achilles and I will be holding back from the three that you two will defeat.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...No doubt the enemy Casters will move to dispel the field, but I believe it will take them some time.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I'm fairly sure the Caster of Black, Avicebron,  
is ill-equipped to deal with such things.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
And Shakespeare's...well...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Indeed, I cannot imagine that either of them has the skills needed to disable a Bounded Field.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Very well then, we will return shortly.  
Achilles, come and help me.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Nine Servants... If I handle Karna and Semiramis,  
and ignore all the other attacks...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Achilles!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Gah!!!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
What is it, Teacher?  
I was just thinking about how I'm gonna fight them all!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I need your help to create the Bounded Field.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Huh? But I'm no good at that sort of thing.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I know.  
That's why I'm asking you.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
A-ANOTHER lesson? Now!?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
But of course. Planning your strategy before a battle is one of the most important steps toward victory. As such, you will continue to do so while you help me prepare the Bounded Field spell.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
We will be facing nine at once. A split-second decision will mean the difference between life and death.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Getting accustomed to thinking about several different things at once now will aid your decision-making capabilities later. It is a part of your training.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Okay, okay, I'll do it already!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
I swear, I can't let my guard down for a moment around you...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...  
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's up?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Oh, it's nothing. I was just thinking how well that teacher and student complement one another.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Chiron was the Archer of Black,  
and Achilles the Rider of Red.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
They were, in fact, enemies during the Great Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
As I recall, Achilles was born to a god... As such, he isn't easy to harm without possessing Divinity as well.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
And the only Servant on the Black side who did...was Chiron.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Of course, Chiron isn't one to pull his punches,  
even when facing one of his former pupils.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I wasn't able to see it for myself,  
but I'm told theirs was an incredibly fearsome battle.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You really know your stuff.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Well, I did survive the Great Holy Grail War myself, though not because I was particularly strong.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I wasn't even a Master.  
I just... How do I put this...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I suppose I was very lucky.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I wasn't very skilled, nor did I have the sort of charisma needed to command a Servant.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Could you tell me more about what happened?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Yes, I suppose I should.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I don't think it will be especially useful, but now that I've summoned you here, the least I can do is answer your questions.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I am an artificially created life-form called a homunculus.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Huh? You thought homunculi were enemies that looked like snowmen?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I'm afraid I don't know anything about that. I can only assume those homunculi were made some other way.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
They do say that we&ndash;well, the Yggdmillennia production process was the work of a distinguished family of alchemists.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
As for me, an Yggdmillennia mage created me so that I could provide magical energy.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...It takes a vast amount of magical energy to keep a Servant materialized, to say nothing of using their Noble Phantasm.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
So there were a lot of other homunculi besides me who were all here at this fortress to provide the Servants with magical energy.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Over half of them ended up wrung completely dry of magical energy and died...but I ran away.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...All because I didn't want to die.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...You say that like it's a bad thing.  
   
**Sieg:**   
Ah...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I guess...I would be lying if I said I didn't feel guilty.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Both about abandoning everyone so I could survive...and that I am still alive now...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you regret that?  
   
**Sieg:**   
...That's a difficult question,  
but...I don't think so.  
  
   
  
   
**Sieg:**   
This Greater Grail is precious. Every Servant who fought in the war risked their lives for it.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I can't let it fall into the wrong hands.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...Tonight's Great Holy Grail War is about to begin.  
Are you ready, Achilles?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Hell yeah I am!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
We will hold off nine of the hostile Servants,  
and you will defeat three of them.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Sir Sieg, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru, are you ready?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I am.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All set!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Good.  
I wish you luck.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Don't worry. You can always shout for help if things go sideways!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
But hey, I'm sure things'll work out somehow!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
All right...let's go!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...Screen spell, Asteri Amina.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Good, they've been separated.  
Now it's time to lure them out.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
We shall do our utmost to ensure that [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru and Sir Sieg are able to defeat their targets without drawing attention to themselves.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
And of course, do take care not to destroy the wall.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Man, that's a lotta stuff to keep track of. This is already tough, and you're not exactly making it easier!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Hahaha, don't worry. I have less practical experience in battle than you do.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
If anything, I will be counting on YOU to show ME the ropes.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Okay, I see three of them.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
The Caster of Red, the Caster of Black,  
and the Assassin of Black, huh?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
They are not quite as strong as many of the others, but they are still quite formidable.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Make sure to watch out for the Assassin,  
Jack the Ripper, in particular.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, I, uh...I know.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Good.  
...Let's go, Master!  
  
   
## Section 3: Are You Our Mommy?  
   
**Sieg:**   
How do you like that!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...It's morning!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Sir Sieg! [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Hey, you're alive!  
Looks like you even kicked some ass!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
The other nine have fallen back as well.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
While we still don't know what the next night will bring...for now, let us rejoice in our victory.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
You said it!  
Thank you, everyone.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I only hope something changes for the better before tonight...  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Ah, don't worry. It'll all work out.  
That's what my gut says, and it hasn't failed me yet.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I hope you're right...  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Man, Sieg, you're a bit of a downer, aren't you?  
Why all the pessimism?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I can't help but be anxious. Not with the Greater Grail's fate resting on my shoulders.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
What's the big deal?  
It's yours to do with as you want, right?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
If worse comes to worst,  
couldn't you just smash it and call it a day?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
No, I couldn't.  
That...that's the one thing I can't do.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Hmm.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
There must be something driving the Servant copies,  
though I'm afraid I don't know what it may be...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
At any rate, why don't we take the rest of today off?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...After we prepare another screen spell,  
just in case they'll fall for the same trick.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...You mean I have to do all that AGAIN!?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Sir Sieg, would you be so kind as to accompany  
[♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru back to the fortress?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Of course.  
Shall we, Fujimaru?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Now that I think about it, it seems rude to call you by your name. How should I address you?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You can call me whatever you want, really.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I see...  
Then I'll try to think of something that suits me.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I'm going to check up on my real body.  
Go ahead and get some rest.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I don't think you'll have to worry about getting hungry while you're here...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...but if you feel like eating something, I'd be happy to bring you some food from the communal kitchen.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm fine, thank you.  
   
**Sieg:**   
I see.  
Then please get some rest.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Sweet dreams.  
...That does have a nice ring to it.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You know, I think I would like to grab a bite.  
   
**Sieg:**   
Understood.  
I'll bring it to you while you sleep.  
  
   
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So sleepy again...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Mo...mmy...  
Mommy. Mommy...!  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Captured.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Murderer on a misty night, serial killer of women, young girl, gestalt evil spirit, Assassin-class, high-rank Presence Concealment, expert torturer.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Jack the Ripper.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It's all up to you now, Keter Malkuth!  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I believe you can create Eden in this land...!  
Now go! Save the world! Go and save our people!  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Captured.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Kabbalist, golem master, foundation creator, philosopher and poet, Caster-class, ruler of stone giants.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Avicebron.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Indeed, as it turns out, I am quite pathetic when it comes to combat magecraft.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But you, gods, will give us some faults to make us men.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Captured.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
The greatest writer in the world, artist, stage actor, sovereign of stories, Caster-class, incomparable playwright.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
William Shakespeare.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Establishing all three Servants' Spirit Origins.  
Adding to ■■■.  
  
   
**???:**  
...y.  
...my.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That was a weird dream...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Err... Is someone speaking to me...?  
  
   
**???:**  
Helloooooo! Are you awaaake!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sieg? Is that you?  
  
   
**???:**  
Nooo!  
I'm not Sieg. Come on, Mommy!  
  
   
**???:**  
Ah, you're awake!  
  
   
**???:**  
Good morning. Are you our mommy?  
  
   
**???:**  
It's okay if you're not!  
You still seem like it!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What the...!?  
  
   
**???:**  
We're the Assassin of Black, Jack the Ripper.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Is something wrong? Why are you so surprised?  
You are the one who summoned us, right, Mommy?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Fujimaru, we've got trouble!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
You're...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't even know what's going on anymore...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...M-me neither.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Who're you? Are you a Servant?  
A friend? A foe? Which ooone?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
What do you want me to do with him, Mommy?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just calm down, okay?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I'm a friend.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I'm...your friend.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
...Oh really? We don't really get it,  
but we're not gonna fight, huh?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Come with me. It's not just her. The other two Servants we fought last night have shown up as well.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I see, I see!  
So that's what's going on here!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Well, now that I know what is happening,  
permit me to introduce myself!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
My name is William Shakespeare. Though perhaps Caster of Red would better suit me here?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Oh, hello there!  
I see, so you're the Greater Grail's Custodian.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
And you must be the Master of Chaldea he summoned!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...I see, I see. So you have come to save the Custodian's bacon, as it were.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Hahahaha, how wonderful, how fantastic!  
What an extraordinary life you must lead!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Please allow me to mark this occasion by quoting a line from one of my many famou&ndash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do you ever shut up?  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
So the only ones who came back to life were those of us you two fought last night?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Exactly.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Now, I have a question for all of you:  
Do you recall why you were summoned here?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Not at all, no.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Likewise.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
No idea. A Holy Grail War?  
...No, that's not it.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We don't sense any bloodlust or animosity,  
even though you're Servants.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
This is quite a surprise...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I did consider this possibility, but I never thought we would be joined by three more Servants all at once.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
This is certainly a welcome change in our situation.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Hell yeah! Now this is more like it!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Sir Shakespeare.  
Sir Avicebron.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
And...um...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Us? We're Jack the Ripper.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
You're whom!?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
The hell!?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Well now, it seems this is a day of surprises.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...That's true. When you think about it,  
this really IS surprising.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Mommyyy, everyone's looking at us funny...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay guys, no more staring.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's okay, Jack. Come here.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
'kaaay.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I didn't know she was so attached...  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Chiron, perhaps you can explain what's going on here in a way that all of us can understand?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Very well then, I shall do my best to be concise.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Now...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...I...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
...see.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Sir Sieg. [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
It seems that the other Servants will return to our side once you have defeated them.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
This should give us more than even odds against the remaining nine Servants.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Yeah, I'd say things are looking up now.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Teacher? May I say something?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
The difficulty here is that I am afraid Avicebron and I are simply not at all suited for combat.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
No need to worry about that, Sir Shakespeare.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Master Fujimaru and Sir Sieg know very well what you can and cannot do, and are sure to provide expert guidance.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Th-that's a pretty tall order...  
But I'll do what I can.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Are you up for this, Fujimaru?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll figure something out...I think.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I see, I see. In that case, dear patrons, we gladly offer our services for you to employ as you see fit!  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Thank you for having us.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
What should we do, Mommy and Mr. Custodian?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Okay, well first let's figure out how we can best incorporate them into our plan for tonight.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll start by keeping an eye on Shakespeare.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can't have a certain genius writer slacking off.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Good point.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Speaking for myself, though, I just want to make sure you don't do anything that would complicate the situation further.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I'm glad to know you two trust me so implicitly!  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
What in the world did you do?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Hey! Mr. Custodian!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Y-yes?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Are you avoiding us?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
No, of course I'm&ndash;  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
No, I guess I am, aren't I?  
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Did we try to kill each other or something?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Yes. I...I'm afraid I saw what happened in your past.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Hmm. Now we understand.  
What did you think about it?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I thought...it was horrible.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Yes, we guess it was.  
But why does it bother you, Mr. Custodian?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Why would other people's pasts or memories matter to you?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Well, I care...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I wanted to save all of you.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Even though we're here now because you couldn't save us?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...That's true. You're right about that.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Hmm, what's the expression for this again?  
I think it's...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Feeling down?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Not exactly, but it's close...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
At a loss for words?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
That's it.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We see. So we lost.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Well, technically speaking,  
I wasn't the one who beat you...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...but I WAS there when you fell.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
That's okay. We were fighting a Holy Grail&ndash;a Great Holy Grail War, right?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Everybody tries to kill everybody else in those.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
But, we were on the Black team, right?  
So why were we fighting you?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Didn't Mr. Chiron say you were on the Black team too?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...It's kind of a long story.  
Do you still want to hear it?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Nuh-uh!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Got it.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Why don't we talk about something else, then?  
How does that sound?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Sure!  
As long as it's not about doctors or London!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
All right then, let's see...  
I know, what about food?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I didn't realize we'd been talking for so long.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Oh, it's Mommy! Hi, Mommy!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'd better get going.  
   
**Jack:**   
It's gonna be night soon?  
Okay, let's go!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's almost time for the next battle.  
   
**Sieg:**   
Right.  
Let's give it our all!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Yeah!  
  
   
  
   
**Chiron:**   
All right, our plan for tonight is essentially the same as yesterday. We will lure three enemy Servants out and distract the others so they don't interfere.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
But tonight, I won't ask Sir Sieg and Master Fujimaru to handle the three Servants all on their own.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Achilles, I want you to go with them while I handle the diversion.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Really? You sure?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Avicebron, I want you to summon as many golems as you can and have them follow my lead.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
As for Shakespeare... Why don't you cast Enchant on whichever side you think would provide the most entertainment?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's your plan for him!?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Most happily! In that case,  
I shall go with Fujimaru, naturally!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
For [♂ his /♀ her] side looks to be entertaining indeed!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
You see? It worked out nicely.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Chiron's actually quite cunning...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Of course, do be aware that I absolutely will not be taking part in the fighting myself!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Teacher! Teacher!  
We wanna fight with Mommy too!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I'm sorry, Jack, but I'm afraid that would leave a hole in our defenses.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
And that would only make trouble for your mother.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Aww...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Please, Jack?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Oh, all right, Mommy!  
We'll go do our best to dismember them all!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I'm surprised she's so obedient...  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
All right then, Sieg and Master,  
let's get this party started!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Hm? Ah, it's no big deal. I can tell you're a good Master from the way you fought last night.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
So, y'know, it just makes sense for me to take my orders from you!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
But hey, don't worry about me.  
You don't need to change anything you're doing.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Just keep following your own path,  
and I'll clear the way for you.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you.  
   
**Achilles:**   
No problem!  
Trust me, I got it covered!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Would you happen to know the Queen of the Amazons?  
   
**Achilles:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Y-yes, I do.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Wait. Don't tell me she's on the enemy side? She's not, right? Huh? She could be summoned to Chaldea at some point?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
N-no. That's fine. I'm fine. This is fine...  
Everything...everything is fine. Yes.  
  
   
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...This feels so strange.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Hm? What do I mean? Well, during the Great Holy Grail War, I never directly interacted with Achilles.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I never thought I'd end up fighting alongside him.  
This should make for some good memories.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Memories?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Well, yeah. It's nice having memories like this, isn't it? Far as I'm concerned, you can never have too many.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Especially in my case,  
since I don't have all that many to begin with.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
All right, let's get to fighting. There's no way we can lose with this team, no matter who we're up against.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...At least, I hope so.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Well that doesn't sound good.  
What's up? You worried about something?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Honestly, I've got a bad feeling about this.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
It's great that all three Servants we defeated came over to our side. That's certainly the best outcome we could've wished for.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
But...that's also why I'm worried.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I can't see us having that kind of luck twice.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...Yeah, I guess you've got a point there.  
In fact, I've been feeling the same thing.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
And I'm sure that means we're going to be facing some tough opponents! We're counting on you, Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I-I'll do my best!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
All right, tonight's Great Holy Grail War is about to begin. Good luck to you all!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Very well then, my boon companions! Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war! Keep my glorious words close to your heart, and may fortune smile upon you!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Is that really going to help us...?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Oh well, I guess we don't need it anyway.  
Let's go, Fujimaru!  
  
   
## Section 4: Confrontation: Dual Swords and Cavalry  
   
**Achilles:**   
Got 'em!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...Man. I can't say exactly what it is,  
but something about this really bothers me.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Agreed. But at least while we were fighting them,  
it was clear they were enemies.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
And since it wasn't possible to talk with them,  
fighting was the only choice we had.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Still...don't you think it's strange?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Normally, no one can so much as scratch me unless they've got divine blood...  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...but those guys practically beat me black and blue back there.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Yes, I see what you mean.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
It's possible there's more to Atalante and Spartacus's legends than we know...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...but there's absolutely no way Frankenstein could secretly have divine blood.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Her origin is too modern, and the circumstances of her creation rule it out entirely.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Maybe so, but I can still feel the spikes from that mace of hers when she smacked me with the thing!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
That would've caved in anyone else's rib cage.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Are you still alive, Achilles?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Last I checked.  
How 'bout you, Teacher?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I am, yes, as you see.  
Though I am considerably worse for wear.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
I'm afraid it was all my golems could do just to hold back one of the enemy Servants.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Are you okay, Mommy?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What about you, Jack? Are you hurt?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Hmm. We think we're hurt a lot...  
Yeah, we're really hurt a lot...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
But we're okay!  
We made fog and used it to get away!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I'm glad to see you're all alive.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We don't think we are all alive, Mr. Custodian.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What do you mean...!?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Yes, that's right.  
We need to hurry back to the fortress!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
You see, we actually faced eight Servants.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
And somehow those Servants included both Jack and Avicebron.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
That was certainly a surprise.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
It was odd, I must admit,  
to be fighting a stronger version of myself.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Curiously, Shakespeare was nowhere to be seen.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Oh no. You don't mean...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I'm afraid I do.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
They may have decided to divide and conquer,  
just like we have...!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Then, the Caster of Red may have gone to fight Shakespeare...!?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I thought I was a goner!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're still alive!?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Hahaha, welcome back! I'm thrilled to see you're all safe! Though not as much as I am to BE safe!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I say, is something wrong?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
You all seem quite disappointed.  
Don't tell me you were hoping I was dead!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, no, nothing like that.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Hahaha, be at ease, Shakespeare.  
We are, of course, all relieved to see you are safe.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
But, Mr. Chiron, didn't you say we would have to redo all the fortress's defenses if he died?  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
I also recall you saying you would need to keep Master safe, now that the enemy has taken us by surprise.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Hahahaha, only in the hypothetical sense, I assure you.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Well, if the truth must out&ndash;and we all know it must&ndash;I was quite sure I had breathed my last when I came under attack!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Thank goodness I'm so weak!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How do we know you're the real Shakespeare?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Oh dear, not this trope! You don't really think I've been switched out for my evil doppelgänger, do you!?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Hmm, then again, he was me in every sense, a perfect facsimile, so I may not be altogether credible here...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
That is, aside from the fact that he never said a word, and was shrouded in a most ominous aura...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Still, were one to suggest I might become a more complete version of myself by defeating...myself, I could hardly gainsay them.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Uh-oh. I seem to have talked myself into a corner!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
O world, thy slippery turns, indeed!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Dismember, dismember♪  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
(Gulp) The child fairly radiates excitement...  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Well, even if that does turn out to be the case,  
I see no great cause for concern.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
After all, if our assumptions are correct, the Servants we defeated last night should soon come to our side.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Yes, that's true. Very well then, Shakespeare, please remain close to me until the new Servants arrive.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
One question, Professor:  
What fate might I meet should I decline to do so?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I hope it does not come to that.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Transient version of him though you may be, it would still pain me to fill the world's greatest writer with arrows...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Heavens, you're quite serious, aren't you?  
Understood!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
All right, now we just have to wait for the resummoning.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Does this mean...things are going well?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I'm not so sure.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I have the sense that matters are progressing according to the enemy's plan.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
What about you, Sir Sieg?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Yes, I agree.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I feel like our enemy is going to come at us even harder, enough to negate our newfound advantage.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Not to mention that it seems all their Servants have gained Divinity somehow...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Those other versions of us were really tough. If they're even stronger next time...we might not be able to beat them.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Even so, our job hasn't changed.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
[♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru is right.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
No matter what they may come at us with,  
this is the only viable strategy we have.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
We will just have to have faith that our opponent's strength is not without limit.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Very well then, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru&ndash;No,  
on second thought, perhaps I should address you as...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...our Master.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
We will be counting on you once again in the next battle as well.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Rider, it was fine with me. Once I had fallen, I wouldn't have needed to spread my wings and fly any longer...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Captured.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Hero of Greek mythology, provider of wind, retainer to Artemis, hero of the Argonauts, hunter of the Calydonian Boar, noble beast.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Atalante.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It'll take more than cutting off my legs to stop me.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Captured.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Giant of a man who shattered the shackles of oppression, smiling rebel who lay waste to all around him, indomitable monster of the coliseum.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Spartacus.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Come...with...me.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Captured.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Dr. Frankenstein's greatest legacy, girl revived with lightning, patchwork body, doll with a heart of fury.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Frankenstein.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Establishing all three Servants' Spirit Origins.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
This is not the end. I won't let it end.  
I'll never let it end.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I brought you something to eat.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It seems like there's more food now than last time?  
   
**Sieg:**   
Oh, yes, I thought we might eat together.  
Assuming you don't mind, of course.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is this for two people?  
   
**Sieg:**   
Yes, if it's not too much trouble...  
  
   
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Good. ...I'm glad.  
All right, shall we?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I hope it tastes okay?  
I can't tell myself.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's delicious.  
   
**Sieg:**   
I'm glad to hear that.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
When the Greater Grail first came into my possession, I never thought I'd one day use my power as its Custodian for something as simple as cooking.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I've never actually cooked before, you see.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Chiron looks like he knows his way around a kitchen,  
but he's got plenty of other things to worry about.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You mean you can't taste anything?  
   
**Sieg:**   
Not very well, no.  
Not unless it's really sweet...and even then, just barely.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
So the only way I can cook is to use my power as the Greater Grail's Custodian to grant a wish.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...But I figured a little wish-granting would be okay, especially if it was done to help you.  
  
   
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I see, I see.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Chaldea... The Incineration of Humanity...  
Seven Singularities... Rayshifting...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Shadow Border... A world of white nothingness,  
as far as the eye can see...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Chaldea... The Incineration of Humanity...  
Seven Singularities... Rayshifting...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Chaldea... The Incineration of Humanity...  
Seven Singularities... Rayshifting...  
  
   
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...It sounds like you have more than your share of troubles in your world, too.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Don't worry, though.  
I promise you'll be fine.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Whatever happens here, I will use my power as the Greater Grail's Custodian to send you home. You have my word on that.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
So please, just think of this as an unusually long dream.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
If things take a turn for the worse,  
all you have to do is wake up.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Don't thank me. I'm the one who dragged you into all this, after all.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
But never mind that. I'd love to hear more about your world. I'm especially interested in what you were like before you became a Master.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You know, come to think of it...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Hm?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You don't talk like you do when you're a dragon.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Oh, that? Well...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Nobody in my world had ever summoned a Master before, so...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I gave it some thought and figured I should try to act...appropriate for that form, I suppose?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
In hindsight, I guess I might've sounded kind of silly, though...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I mean, all that faux Old English and such...what was I thinking? It's embarrassing!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Please...just do me a favor and forget all that?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Ah!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Somebody's attacking me in the courtyard!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Ughhh... Ughhh!!!  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuugh!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...  
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Looks like she's trying to tell you those are her flowers...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think...she wants you to get off the flowers...?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I, uh, I see.  
I'm impressed you understood her.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Nonetheless, that dragon is my real body,  
and I'm afraid I can't move it right now.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
You can, um, just shove it into a corner if you want?  
I'm afraid that's the best I can offer. Sorry...  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Ugh...  
Uhh...  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Hmm. So that means...  
Yes, it would seem this dragon is an oppress&ndash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No! No oppressors here!  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Oppressor... Not an oppressor...  
Hmm, that's a difficult question.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
After all, I came to this land to fight,  
to overthrow my enemies.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
So would it not follow that the dragon IS a symbol of the oppressors here?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uhh...  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
...He's not an oppressor?  
Very well, then I shall wait.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
The oppressors are sure to come. When they do, that is when I shall act, and my songs of triumph ring forth.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
In the meantime...I will wait here,  
in this flower garden.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Good night, sweet rebellion.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Ugh!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There, there.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Easy now.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Zzz...  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Ugh... Uhh...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
So they've both fallen asleep, huh...  
Oh well, they should wake up once night falls.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Anyway, if they've both been summoned,  
then she must have been as well...  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Achilles, was it?  
Do I have something on my face?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Are you the same Atalante my old man told me about?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Ah, I see. So you're Peleus's son.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I remember beating him in a wrestling match once.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
That was a good match.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Atalante, I'm sorry to impose,  
but would you help me build the trap for tonight?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Your skills as a huntress likely make you far better at placing a trap in a forest than I.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Very well.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...I must ask, though:  
Why was I resummoned?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Actually, was I even properly summoned to begin with?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
If we are inside the Greater Grail now,  
then what am I supposed to do?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I believe we are meant to fight in order to keep the Greater Grail safe. Even if we were indeed enemies in the original war.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Well, that is no matter. I have had plenty of other former enemies become allies before.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
You and I were both Red,  
so I guess we were always allies.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
So, the immortal Achilles is my ally now, huh?  
Usually I would find that encouraging...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...but if all our opponents have Divinity,  
that does not offer much of an advantage.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Perhaps, but even without his invincibility,  
he is far more powerful than any of them.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...Indeed, it is quite fortunate that Achilles is not on their side.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Especially since we are the only ones on our side with divine blood at the moment.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I must say, it is an odd feeling to know that a copy of myself fights for our enemy...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Achilles, be sure you do not drag my corpse around the fortress.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
I'm not gonna do that!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
If I was ever going to do something like that,  
it'd be as a Berserker!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Haha, I was just kidding.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Since I am based on the data from before the Great Holy Grail War began, my Spirit Origin has no recollection of this...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...but I imagine we must have exchanged similar quips before, given that we were both part of the Red camp.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Yeah, we probably did.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
You know, I was hoping I'd get to meet you someday.  
My old man used to talk about you all the time.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Stop that. It is embarrassing.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Ah, youth is such a splendid thing...  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
I do not believe Servants are either truly old or young. ...Hmm.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Is something wrong?  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
No, there's just something nagging me about Shakespeare.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Did you find some evidence that he is an imposter?  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
No, nothing like that.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
What troubles me is that the enemy version of him decided to come to the fortress.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
If it had been any other Servant...  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
...we might have faced eradication.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Hmm. I see.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...In that case, I'll speak to Master,  
and see if we can't stay one step ahead.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
All right.  
...Let's go!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Good luck! May fortune smile on you all!  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
I doubt you'll need us on the front lines anymore,  
so I'll stay here and await your return.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Along with my golems, of course.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Okay Mommy, let's gooo!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Atalante.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're counting on you!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Right.  
To the twin gods I offer this...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Phoebus Catastrophe!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Tch, a Noble Phantasm!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
That must be Rider...Astolfo's Noble Phantasm.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
His hippogriff can pass through any kind of attack.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
In that case, we just continue to attack until it rematerializes. Come, Chiron!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Right there with you!  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
There you are, oppressors! So you've decided to take cover in the night and strike at us from the shadows, have you!?  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
That will not protect you from the destruction of my love!  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Good mooorniiing, rebellion!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, you've certainly got greetings covered...  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...All right, let's split 'em up like we always&ndash;Huh!?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
This...this is my Bounded Field!  
So they DID learn how to separate us!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Sir Sieg! Master!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...It seems Chiron was right about the enemy appearing within the fortress.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Assassin...I mean, Jack the Ripper.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Yes, yes! We're here, Mr. Custodian.  
What is it?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Can you tell me what the enemies you saw looked like?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Okay. Let's see...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
There were two Sabers with heavy armor,  
and a Lancer who seemed kind of girly...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Hmm. Maybe he was actually a Rider?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
If he was short, then he couldn't have been either of the two Lancers.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Then he must've been the Rider of Black.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I see.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Oh, we also saw a few things that looked like Shadow Servants.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We were there too, so we think...they're probably leftovers from last time or something?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How strong were they?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Not strong at all! They were easy!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We can dismember all of them for you in no time!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
All right, then we take out any enemies that make their way here, and continue to protect the Casters.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Since we expected something like this might happen,  
we shouldn't have anything to worry about.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Fujimaru, go ahead and tell us what to do!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Ugggh!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We're counting on you, Mommy!  
Okay, time to go ripping!  
  
   
## Section 5: Chiron the Sage's Combat Exercise  
   
**Jack:**   
Dismembeeer!!! Wheee!!!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We won!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Ugh!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Hooray!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
The Rider of Black, Astolfo.  
The Saber of Black, Siegfried.  
The Saber of Red, Mordred.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I can confirm that they've all disappeared.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Truth be told, I have mixed feelings about this...  
But at least we were able to outwit them and win.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I hate to think of what might have happened if Avicebron hadn't realized what they were up to...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh!?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I'm all right. I think my control over the Greater Grail just wavered a little bit.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
It's odd, though, considering how many Servants we've defeated... Does this mean my ownership of the Grail wavering has nothing to do with this war?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
What happens when it wavers?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
It means someone other than me will take possession of the Greater Grail.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Hmm.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
If they want it that badly,  
why don't you just let them have it?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
You're not even a Servant, right?  
Why kill yourself over this?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
A Servant once tried to use this Greater Grail to make a wish come true.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
And I'm the one who stopped that from happening.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
So, I guess...I kind of have a responsibility to make sure the Greater Grail is never misused.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
...We don't really understand, but okay.  
It sounds like you had a hard life.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I wouldn't say that. It may not have lasted long, but I enjoyed it.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Anyway, the battle is now over.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Fujimaru, do you know the Rider of Black...er, Astolfo?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yup.  
   
**Sieg:**   
I see. Then you also know how...difficult he can be at times.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
He's a lot of fun, too, though...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nope.  
   
**Sieg:**   
I see... Well, try not to be too shocked by how he behaves.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
He's easily the most unhinged out of all fourteen Servants.  
  
   
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Anyway, it's encouraging to know that both the Black and Red Sabers will soon be joining us.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Though I have to say, our “family”  
is growing rather large...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't know if we can keep them all in line anymore.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I've been thinking the same thing.  
Still, we'll just have to do our best.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
There can be no atonement for this sin.  
I may be dooming him to a life of violence.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But even so...I choose to offer up my life to him.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Captured.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Immortal body, sword-wielding fortress, Dragon-Slayer,  
the hero who bears a thousand hopes upon his back.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Siegfried.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Don't worry about me. I don't care if I'm mistaken.  
I don't care if I'm deluded. I'm fine with this.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
So don't worry about me.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Captured.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Knight of the Round Table, traitor, the one who ended the reign of King Arthur, hero of red lightning, usurper of the throne, curse of the King of Knights.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Mordred.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Yeah! Good luck to you too!  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Captured.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
The legend of Charlemagne, troublemaker, absent of reason, devoted Samaritan, knight of miracles.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Astolfo.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Only three Servants left.  
It won't be much longer now.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...It will be a bit of a wait, though.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I believe humans will make it here eventually, so I'm willing to wait until they do. Even if it takes a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand years.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Still, if I have any regrets...  
Well, it would be nice to talk to someone.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Homunculus, human, Servant...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
As long as we could just talk about anything,  
really, I wouldn't care who it was with.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...That wish already came true with astonishing ease.  
I know so many things.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I know their memories from the Great Holy Grail War.  
I know all their data. I even know how each of them met their ends.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Of course, there's no need to say any of that,  
and I don't plan on doing so.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It's just...none of the Servants who gathered here knew about the Great Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I'm guessing they don't have the data from it. They're the same as they were on the first day of the war.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Hiya, people I've never met!  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...That explains why he reacted that way.  
It's still kind of sad, though.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Nice to meet you.  
You must be Astolfo.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
And you two must be...  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Well? What's goin' on here, Custodian?  
Just give us the quick version, yeah?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Of course. I was just about to.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I see. So that is why both the Black and Red camps have gathered here.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Very well, I shall lend you my aid.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Thank you.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
So this isn't the Great Holy Grail War?  
Damn. What a drag.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Go ahead and sit the rest out if you want.  
Not like one more Saber's gonna make a difference.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...What was that? You wanna fight or something, punk?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Hey, so you DO get it!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Things are getting worse by the day around here.  
It's all we can do just to keep our heads above water.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
If you're not gonna help us fight, then get lost.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Now I get it. 'Course, it was pretty obvious just looking at you.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Oh yeah?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
You're pissin' me off. C'mon. Let's go.  
You and me. No weapons. Just fists.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Now you're talking...!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uhhh!!!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey! What was that for, Frankenstein!?  
That really hurt!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh?  
...Don't fight in the courtyard?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
It's small, and if we fight, we'll kill the flowers?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Tch.  
Fine, whatever.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
You heard her.  
If we're gonna do this, we gotta take it outside.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...Eh, pass. Moment's gone.  
She took all the fun out of it.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh yeah?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I'm glad to see such esteemed heroes getting along so well.  
  
   
**Both:**   
The hell we are!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Not to worry. You'll get along fine once you start fighting side by side, whether you like it or not.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
And I will not take no for an answer.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Heh... It seems things worked out nicely.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Gimme a break...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Took the words right outta my mouth.  
Now then.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Custodian, have you started losing ownership of the Greater Grail, or not?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I have, yes. I'm steadily losing control.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why didn't you say so sooner!?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Then there's no point in fighting these guys off.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I see. Then what do you suggest?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh come the hell on. You're telling me the “Great Sage” hasn't figured this out? The only thing still left is the Hanging Gardens.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Yes, I suppose you're right. I'd been putting it off because of how dangerous it is...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...but now that we have this many capable fighters on our side, attacking it has become a viable option.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
However, I believe the Hanging Gardens is the Assassin of Red...Semiramis's Noble Phantasm. Correct, Sir Sieg?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Yes.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
As long as she's in that garden,  
Semiramis is as powerful as a Ruler.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Back when we were fighting her,  
all she did was just bombard us from her garden.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
But, if we board the garden ourselves,  
it will be a different matter.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
All twelve of us will have to focus on defending ourselves when we're there.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Our chances of victory are...slim at best.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Why do we not simply attack now, before nightfall?  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
I actually tried sending a flying golem in there yesterday, at Chiron's behest...  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
...but as soon as night fell,  
it was teleported back to the surface.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
So we believe that our enemy has already taken measures against a daytime attack.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Shoulda figured it wouldn't be that easy.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Yes, that WILL make this very difficult...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I have only seen it from a distance at night,  
but its defenses are obviously quite formidable.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Were you able to make it up there, Custodian?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Well... During the Great Holy Grail War,  
the Black Team's Master's used stolen airplanes...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
And Rider&ndash;Astolfo, that is... Well, he rode his hippogriff up to it, dodging its defenses all the way.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
On top of that, our Ruler used a defensive skill that protected us from more than half of the bombardment Semiramis unleashed from her garden.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Right now, we have Achilles's chariot and Astolfo's hippogriff, but&ndash;  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
I'm afraid it will be difficult to attack the garden with those alone.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Convenient as it would be were she to simply open the garden's gates to us, I rather doubt she will be so accommodating. More likely, she will defend her garden quite fiercely.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, Chiron, got any brilliant ideas to get us in there?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Such things are always useful when there is a weakness to exploit, but I am afraid no amount of planning or brilliance can break those defenses.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I'm afraid we may have no choice but to charge through the front door. Sir Sieg, is your true body recovered enough to be able to move?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I've had it resting the last few days to focus on healing up.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
If nothing else, it should be able to fly now.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
But even so, breaking in will be difficult. If I take another Noble Phantasm, I'll fall right out of the sky.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Especially if it happens to be Siegfried's.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
His Noble Phantasm is especially dangerous to me,  
given that it slew a dragon.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Even the slightest scratch from it could send me crashing down.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...I'm sorry I caused such trouble for you while I was on the opposing side.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Ugh.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
She says, “Don't worry 'bout it.”  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Unfortunately, we have no choice but for you to fly if we are to assault the garden's front gates.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
It's not that I'm scared...  
Well, no, I guess I AM scared.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I'm scared I won't actually be able to do this&ndash;that I won't be able to get you there safely.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Oh? Apologies. It seems I was not clear. We will, of course, ALL be contributing to this frontal assault.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
You may be the Greater Grail's Custodian, but I would never put this entirely on your shoulders alone.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
In that case, Astolfo and I'll back you up,  
since we can both fly too.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Damn skippy we will!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Don't worry, I promise we'll keep you and Fujimaru safe up there!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Then I'll stay here and watch the&ndash;On second thought, I'd better come along too. I'd be no match for those Dragon Tooth Warriors on my own.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Well, I'd better prepare a sonnet to sing the praises of you, our great heroes! That will surely make fortune smile upon you!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Now then, I'm off to write! Only a few hours left until deadline! Time to get that ink flowing, William!  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Hmm. In my case...I suppose I'll have some golems fly in front of the dragon, to act as his shield.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
If I make full use of the Millennia Fortress's walls for material, they should last at least a little while.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I suppose I could pick off any attackers with my bow...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Do you know something, Custodian?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Atalante, you, uh...  
You have another Noble Phantasm.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I heard you used it to fly during the Great Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...The Calydonian Boar's pelt!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I remember now. You are right.  
There IS more than one way to use the boar's pelt.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Surprising that I would use it to try to win the war, though... I must have been quite desperate.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can you still use it?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I will figure something out.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I do not know that I will be able to stay in the air for overly long, but I should be able to defy gravity for at least a short while.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Mommy, Mommy.  
Can we use our mist?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mist?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You mean your second Noble Phantasm?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Uh-huh.  
It can...uh... What's the word again?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
You know, I can choose who it goes around.  
Do you know what I mean, Mr. Horse Servant?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
So you can freely select who your mist envelops...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
That sounds like it can be directed, then.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Yep! That's it.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Aha, now I see.  
So back then, that's how she&ndash;  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We're gonna ride on Mr. Custodian's back along with Mommy!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Yes, good point.  
Avicebron, Shakespeare.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I'd like you two to ride on Fafnir's back as well.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Ugh...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, Frankenstein...  
I mean, Berserker?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
You and I are gonna team up,  
so I want you staying put on the ground.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Ugh?  
Uh...?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Ah, don't worry so much!  
I got a brilliant plan, trust me!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Is there a legend about you flying that I was unaware of?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Nah, nothing like that. Don't worry, though.  
I'll figure something out!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Long as we get up there, it doesn't matter how, right?  
I'll get us there! Just you watch!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
We'll go shooting up there like a rocket!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So...you're going to explode?  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hell no!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You mean you're gonna use your Ma  
   
**Mordred:**   
Shh.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
That's a damn secret, okay?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh...?  
  
   
  
   
**Sieg:**   
What about you, Siegfried, Chiron, and Spartacus?  
What will you guys do?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Good question...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I'll accompany Achilles in his chariot.  
Assuming that's all right with you?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Fine by me.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Chariots aren't made for just one rider anyway.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Wanna ride on my hippogriff with me, Siegfried?  
I'm sure we can find room for one more!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...It would seem that is my only option.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I'll make sure to defend against the other me's Noble Phantasm.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Guess that just leaves this guy.  
Hey, Spartacus.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
I refuse.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Why!?  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
You bear the stink of oppressors.  
Now that I know our destination, I will find my own way!  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Nothing is impossible for me.  
The sky is but one more obstacle to be overcome.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Please calm down.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Spartacus, you may be a Servant, but I don't believe you have any skills or Noble Phantasms that would let you fly.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Nothing is impossible in this world.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
If birds are capable of flight,  
then humans must be as well.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
If I must become a bird to reach the garden,  
then that is what I shall do.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Yes, I shall be a small, elegant bird,  
soaring gracefully across the sky...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
A-a bird, you say...?  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Cock-a-doodle-doooooo!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Welp, you won't be soaring...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Well, you cannot expect to become a bird overnight, Spartacus. If I were a bird, I would be insulted to hear you think it such a trivial thing to do.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Perhaps we could send a rope down for you? With muscles like that, you should have no trouble climbing up to the garden.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
...  
...You are no oppressor...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
What the hell does this lunkhead use to figure out what's an oppressor anyway?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Good.  
Now we all have a plan to reach the garden.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Indeed.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...Probably.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're fine... Yeah... Toootally fine...  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
I will prove to you that my muscles are truly worthy of your absolute trust.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
All right, then. You three new Servants will officially join our battle lineup.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Our next step is get you acclimated to working with [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru as a team.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Sounds good to me!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Understood.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Aw, c'mon. Really? Do I gotta?  
I already know how to fight just fine.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Indeed. I am certain a warrior of your skill can manage quite capably.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
But working with a team requires more than mere combat skill alone.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Besides, there's nothing better than the feeling one gets after landing a beautiful team combo.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
All the more so when it happens in live combat,  
rather than in practice.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...All right. I guess I could give it a shot.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
(She's like putty in his hands...!)  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
'kay then, I'll go first!  
Looking forward to fighting with ya, Custodian!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Thank you. The pleasure's all mine.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Avicebron, would you mind creating some training golems?  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Very well.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
All right, Astolfo, focus on teamwork,  
and do not run off on your own.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Aye, aye, sir!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I will offer advice, but nothing more.  
Good luck, you two.  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Wooowie! I'm all tuckered out!  
Bleeeah.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Teamwork is an excellent way to compensate for one's weaknesses, but it can also greatly enhance your strengths as well.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Try to keep that in mind once the fighting begins in earnest.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
'kaaay!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Siegfried, you're up next.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Right.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Most of your opponents' attacks will be focused on you, Siegfried.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
You may block them, heal from them, evade them, trade places with another... You are, in short, free to handle this however you see fit.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Well then, here we go!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Now I see.  
This is nice.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...  
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Something wrong?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Oh, no, everything's fine.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I guess I just got caught up in the moment...  
Let's keep going.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Last, but certainly not least: Mordred.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah, yeah, fine. This teamwork stuff's a pain in the ass. I'm just gonna go nuts.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
That's perfectly fine.  
We will simply follow your lead.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Wait, really? You will?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Of course. Rampaging about like a Berserker seems to suit you rather well.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Well, hey, how 'bout that. Guess I don't gotta worry about you clowns. I like that!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Okay, Master, what do you say we get this party started!?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Are you two ready?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Mordred appears to be well suited to quick, decisive battles, so let's try to hit the opponent as hard and fast as we possibly can.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Your goal will be to take out the heavy golems before they can become a threat. All right, begin!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Damn, that was close!  
These golems are way tougher than I thought!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
But I'll finish these jerks off!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Brilliant work.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Aw yeah, piece of cake!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Have you got a handle on how all three teams operate now?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Definitely.  
   
**Sieg:**   
Great. Then let's take a break.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
We still have some time until the sun sets and the Hanging Gardens shows itself.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I could still use a little more time.  
   
**Sieg:**   
I see... Then let's discuss our teamwork a little more, shall we?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
We should still have enough time for that.  
  
   
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I'm afraid we will need to leave this fortress behind. If you have any unfinished business here, now is the time to take care of it.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I'm sorry, Frankenstein. Well...you could pick some flowers to take with you, right?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Aw, look at her, all excited...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
You two really are good friends.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Who, us? Eh, it's pretty simple.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
We're a lot alike.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
You are...?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Forget it.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Anyway, what about you and the Saber of Black?  
You got some kinda problem with Siegfried?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
No, nothing like that.  
At least, not as he is now.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Aw, really? And here I was thinking he must've handed you your ass back during the other war or something.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
That's...  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Sir Custodian, may I have a word with you?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
With me...?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Okay.  
What's this about?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
It seems none of us has any memory of the Great Holy Grail War we once fought here...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
That's right. I think you've all been summoned from the records leading up to it.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Usually, your memories would be engraved in the Throne of Heroes, but the versions of you here right now are not actually complete.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Alternatively, someone might have sealed them away on purpose. Perhaps whoever is orchestrating all this.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I'm told you still have your memories of the war, Sir Custodian. If that's true, I have a question for you...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Of course.  
...Anything.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Did I stay true to myself?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I... I'm afraid I can't answer that.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I see. That's all right. I was just curious.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
No need to give it further thought.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Now that I've been summoned here, whatever grudges I may have held in the past are of no importance.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I will simply fight to the best of my ability.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Thank you.  
That will be a huge help.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
That said, I still find it hard to believe that you are this evil dragon, Sir Custodian...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think you bathed in this dragon's blood once, right?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I did. ...I only hope I need never fight such a battle again.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
It is too terrible to recall...but the feeling of it is forever etched into my soul.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm, uh... I'm sorry...  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
What is it, Master of Chaldea?  
You look terribly embarrassed.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
An apology?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Hmm, I don't know what it is you are sorry for...  
But I promise you, I'm fine. You needn't worry about me.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
You are a Master, a crystallization of the future.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
If you deem my aid necessary,  
I would be glad to lend it to you.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I, uh, I see.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
So Siegfried fought a different Fafnir in Orleans...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Don't worry, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I'm sure he meant it when he said he never wanted to fight a battle like that again...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...but I doubt a hero like him would let something like that stop him from stepping up when he's needed.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I'm sure he'll do whatever he has to.  
All the more so if the fate of humanity is at stake.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
After all, he's the sort of man who would risk his life just to save a homunculus like me...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
He even put me ahead of his own desires,  
and those of the person he had pledged to fight.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
He ended up throwing all that away, because of me.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I don't regret doing what I had to do to survive.  
But, I guess...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Hmm, it's hard to explain.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I wanted to survive, and I want Siegfried to continue fighting.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I feel like those two desires contradict each other,  
but then again, maybe they don't...?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do you feel guilty or something?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Yes, I suppose I do.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
After I became the Greater Grail's Custodian, I learned a lot of things I would have been happier not knowing.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Among them were things that happened without me having been aware at the time.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...The last Servant Atalante fought was Achilles.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Frankenstein was forced to use her Noble Phantasm's full power when she fought with Mordred, even though she knew doing so would be suicide.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
And...a great hero like Siegfried gave up his heart, all to save my life.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
They fought long and hard to acquire the Holy Grail.  
All of their wishes were pure and righteous.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
But in the end, I was the one who ended up with the Greater Grail.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Ever since then, I've been wondering whether I did the right thing or not.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
What would you have done? Would you have been able to accept a wish like that, and allowed the Greater Grail to grant it?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Or would you have made the same choice I did?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Or...would you have taken another option?  
One I didn't see at the time...?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'd have had to be there myself.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's really hard to say.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Right. That makes sense.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...  
...Hm?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
That's weird. It's not as though my problem has been resolved, but...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...for some reason, I feel a bit better now.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe you just needed to talk about it?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...That could be it.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
It's hard to repress the urge to talk. Maybe that's not so surprising, since I've manifested as a terminal.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
We still have some time before we leave for the Hanging Gardens. Would it be okay if we talk a little more?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Thank you.  
In that case...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I'd love to hear about the Servants you know. Without violating their privacy, of course.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I see.  
So you know a ninja, huh?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Mechanical?  
But...she's not a robot, then?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I had no idea they had the technology back then to create a machine capable of becoming a Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I guess ninja really are something else.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
So Divine Spirits have materialized in your world? I see. I guess that makes sense, given the crisis humanity is facing.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Huh? The goddess of virginity and the moon that Atalante worships is actually a besotted romantic?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
And Orion...is a tiny teddy bear?  
...Are they even strong?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I would think that being loved by so many people is a good thing.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
So why do you look so exhausted?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
It's a heavy weight to carry?  
I wasn't aware love had mass.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I guess I still have a lot to learn...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Blackbeard.  
The pirate.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I see. I understand now.  
That one is beyond understanding.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Thank you for sharing all that.  
Chaldea...sounds like a lot of fun.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can't you come to visit?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I'm afraid not.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
It might be possible, but even if it was, I'm obligated to stay here and take care of the Greater Grail.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Once this battle is over, I'm going to stay here. I'm...waiting for someone to show up.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
That's the one decision I can't change.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see. That's too bad...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
If it was difficult or painful to do that,  
I might not be able to handle it.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
But it's just a long wait, so it's no trouble at all.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Still...it's nice of you to be concerned about me.  
I appreciate that.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I was worried I might have upset you, summoning you out here all of a sudden like this.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...The next battle is going to be for the Hanging Gardens.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Avicebron said he would make a saddle for you,  
so make sure you hold on tight to that.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
But even if you fall,  
I'm sure one of the heroes will save you.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
It could be Astolfo, Achilles,  
Atalante, or Avicebron...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...but whoever it is,  
I'm certain one of them will save you if you need it.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Anyway, we'd better get back.  
We need to get ready to leave too.  
  
   
## Section 6: A Dreamlike Moment  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Guess I won't be seeing THIS room again...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
No, probably not.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Would you like one last thing to eat before we go?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, that's all right.  
   
**Sieg:**   
Okay. In that case, we might as well clean the place up a bit.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Hm? I think I hear the Servants calling me.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Hang on, I'll be right back.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sure, that sounds good.  
   
**Sieg:**   
Okay, just sit tight.  
I'll be back with some food soon.  
  
   
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's keeping him...?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Whooo's ready for a picnic!?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Not a damn picnic!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Aw, crap.  
He's stronger than he looks...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wh-what's this all about?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Rider&ndash;Astolfo said he wanted to have a picnic in the courtyard.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
That it was worth celebrating so many Servants getting together like this, even if we're still missing three.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
What I REALLY said was, “What's the harm?  
You ARE hungry, right? Come on, let's do it!”  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
And the rest is history.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
What...No it isn't!  
What are you talking about!?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Ugh!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Right!?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey! Don't you go turning Fran against me!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Ugh, ugh!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Well... Here we all are, out in the courtyard,  
having sandwiches together...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Having everyone here together is...a bit of a surprise, really.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You said it.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, gimme that one. I'm not eating any of that egg salad shit! I want some MEAT!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
But you're eating it already! AND you tried to steal my sandwich without even asking!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh, uh♪  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Sandwiches...trap meat and other food...  
Does this mean...bread is an oppressor...?  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Even if it were, you can't just eat the sandwich's insides. Then you'd be oppressing the bread.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Hmm.  
Strawberry custard...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
This is very sweet.  
Children would love this.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Mmm, yummy!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
As I thought.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Strawberries taste like blood!  
Both're really sweet!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I, um...do not think that is true...?  
In fact, they are...ah...really quite different.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
You sure?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Hmm. These would make perfect battlefield rations.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
You can eat them in one bite,  
and they provide excellent, balanced nutrition.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...Not that we require nutrition as Servants,  
but old habits die hard.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Nothing wrong with thinking that way!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
My king never batted an eye at whatever she ate,  
no matter how bad it tasted.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
It was like she didn't care one damn bit about flavor, just the nutrients! I'll take your approach over cold efficiency any day!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe she was actually something of a gourmand?  
   
**Mordred:**   
My father?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
That inhuman old fool? Hah! Gimme a break!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
If she turns out to be a gourmand,  
then I'll eat every one of Gawain's “dishes” myself!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You sure she didn't actually want to eat good food?  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hell no.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
It didn't matter HOW good the food was!  
She'd always just give that same disinterested, “Mmm...”  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
If she actually did give a shit about food, I'll eat every one of Gawain's mashed “specials” myself!  
  
   
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
(Ooh, I think I just heard a branch opening up!)  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...Mmm. These came out rather well,  
if I do say so myself.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You made these, Teacher?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I did, yes, though Sieg was kind enough to procure the ingredients for me.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I could never make something this good on my own.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Dammit, these ARE good.  
Ugh, is there anything this guy CAN'T do?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Hell no there isn't.  
My teacher's not a great sage for nothing!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Can he hold a crucifix for an hour straight?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
You bet. He can do one-finger push-ups without breaking a sweat, too.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Can he shoot an apple off the head of an evil chancellor?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
In his sleep. He could shoot the chancellor too, while he was at it.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Can he shoot vacuum blades just by cracking his knuckles?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Easily. They'll go through anything like a hot knife through butter.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
How long can he hold his breath while still acting at full strength?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
As long as it takes for his opponent to keel over!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Is he a mommy?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Raising kids is what he does best!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Ugh?  
(Can he come back to life with lightning?)  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
I'm not sure, but I bet he'd find a way!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...You really mustn't go around making such outlandish claims, Achilles. Though I suppose it bears mentioning that I could indeed manage some of those.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Oh, you can, huh...  
Well, you certainly look like you could.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I admit that I can do most things better than the average person, but I cannot be the best.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I could not win against Achilles or Atalante in a footrace, nor could I defeat Spartacus in a contest of strength.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Indeed, I doubt I could defeat any of you in the areas of your respective specialties.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Archery may be my specialty, but even there I could never defeat, say, the likes of Arash Kamangir, who split the earth itself.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I am a teacher, not a hero.  
I am not meant to stand above others.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
In that sense, Achilles is not my only pupil here.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Sir Sieg, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I consider both of you to be my pupils as well.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I only wish we had more time together.  
There are so many other things I wish I could teach you...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Come to Chaldea!  
   
**Chiron:**   
Hahaha, I'll have to think about that.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I know a girl who'd love to learn from you, too.  
   
**Chiron:**   
Oho.  
Mash Kyrielight, hm?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I see, I see. It sounds like I already have quite the formidable rival teacher.  
  
   
  
   
**Chiron:**   
At any rate, if we are ever summoned to Chaldea,  
it will be as our true selves.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I expect, should that come to pass, that I will have learned all manner of new things, and may even be able to teach you more as well.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Are you freakin' kidding me with this shit?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
There's no point continuing to study and stuff once you're a Servant, right?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Not the way I see it.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
After all, I know someone who kept learning even after they became a Servant.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh really? Who?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I'm afraid I can't tell you.  
I wasn't actually there, you see.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
But I do know that hero never stopped moving forward.  
That much, I can say for absolute certain.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...All right, it's going to be night soon.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I hate to say it, but it's time to bring this picnic to a close.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you for the wonderful meal.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Of course.  
I'm glad you enjoyed it.  
  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I guess it's three minutes until we storm the gardens.  
Is everyone ready!?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
No issues here.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
...This outfit seems a bit...much, no?  
It feels more like a swimsuit than a suit of armor.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Personally, I much prefer my normal attire...  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
I think you look great!  
I don't see a problem at all!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
I was not asking you.  
...Still, I suppose I can make do, since it allows me to fly.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Wahahahaha!  
I wish someone could take a picture of this!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Indeed. ...How you doing there, Hippogriff?  
I hope I'm not too heavy for you.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
He says you're very heavy.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
That figures!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Man, looking at this thing up close,  
it's absurdly freaking large!  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
We'll soon be entering the garden's firing range. Everyone, make sure to evade or block the Tiamtum Ūmu like your life depends on it!  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
All right, now seems a good time to make my golem shield.  
My body is a red shield...Gevurah Armadura!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Hippogriff...dimension evade!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
All right, we'd better&ndash;  
  
   
**A：???:**  
Oh, I just had a revelation.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Oh?  
Who was that...?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Xanthos.  
What do you want?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that horse talking...!?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Ah yes, that is Xanthos. One of the divine steeds that Poseidon himself gave to Achilles.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I believe it is also the only one of the three that can talk.  
  
   
**A：Xanthus:**   
I was just thinking.  
  
   
**A：Xanthus:**   
How come you and Lord Chiron are the only ones not on the enemy side, Lord Achilles?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...Is that really important right now?  
  
   
**A：Xanthus:**   
It is, yes.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
All right then, let's hear it.  
  
   
**A：Xanthus:**   
...I think you two must have been quite expensive.  
  
   
**A：Xanthus:**   
That's not to say Lady Mordred, Lord Siegfried,  
and Lord Karna weren't expensive as well, of course.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
What do you mean by expensive?  
  
   
**A：Xanthus:**   
You know, like in a strategy game.  
  
   
**A：Xanthus:**   
In games like that,  
it is very expensive to create powerful units.  
  
   
**A：Xanthus:**   
First you have to work your way up the tech tree,  
and that takes a long time on its own.  
  
   
**A：Xanthus:**   
And all this time, our opponent in this game,  
this Great Holy Grail War within the Greater Grail...  
  
   
**A：Xanthus:**   
...has been laying the groundwork to produce the most powerful units possible.  
  
   
**A：Xanthus:**   
No doubt whoever it is put in a lot of hard work.  
So, if this opponent is in the Hanging Gardens now...  
  
   
**A：Xanthus:**   
...then of course, they'll be waiting for the right time to use their new units. This just occurred to me.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...Setting aside how you even know what a strategy game is...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...I must admit that is a strong possibility.  
In which case, our first move will have to be...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Achilles.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Y-yeah?  
What is it, Teacher?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
I want you to neutralize the other side's Achilles.  
I'll do the same with their Chiron.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...Aw, c'mon, Teacher.  
Xanthos has a history of blowing smoke up your&ndash;  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...Okay, yep.  
That was me, all right...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
It would seem he was right on the money.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Everyone? Your attention, if I may?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
My Noble Phantasm has no telegraph or tell of any kind. If the enemy Chiron uses it on you, I'm afraid you'll just have to trust in your luck.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
You may as well tell us to roll over and die!  
(↑ Luck rank: E)  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Yeah.  
That is hardly encouraging advice.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
My, my. At long last,  
the battle with all fourteen Servants will begin!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Though we yet lack the Assyrian empress AND the great hero of India!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
To say nothing of the enemy having the Hanging Gardens to serve as their airborne fortress!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...Do we really have a hope of winning this?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
You're the great writer!  
Figure something out!  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
...Their assault is relentless!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Hang on. Where the hell are Mordred and Fran!?  
Oh, and Spartacus, I guess.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
All right then.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh? You wanna know my plan to get us up there?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
It's simple.  
I'm gonna blast up there with my Mana Burst.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Ugh?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Then there was no point in you staying behind?  
'Course there was!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
See, even with my Mana Burst,  
it's gonna be tough getting all the way up there myself.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
But not with you here.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Ugh!?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
You got it.  
Your Noble Phantasm's all about lightning too, right?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
So if we both power each other up, then boom!  
We're in business!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Ugh...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Don't worry, it'll be fine! If we don't make it up there, all that'll happen is we'll crash right back down to the ground.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, right.  
Can't have this armor weighing me down.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
There we go.  
Now, let's do this thing!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
One, two...THREE!  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Hmm. So much for my shield.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
It's Karna...!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We'll make some mist...!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
He keeps blowing it away!  
This is why we hate really powerful Servants!  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
I suppose we have no choice but for me to take the field. Shakespeare, you will be the next sacrifice after the five seconds it takes him to kill me.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Wait!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I don't mind throwing my life away if there's no other choice, but we must have SOME alternative we have not yet tried before it comes to that!  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Hmm.  
...I suppose you're right.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Say, for instance if someone capable of saving us were to suddenly fall from the sky like a shooting star.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Did anyone else just notice a flash of light from the groun  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...Something just shot up, sent Karna flying,  
and smacked into the Hanging Gardens...didn't it...?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...I don't want to think too hard about it, but...I wonder if it might not have been Mordred and Fran...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...(Gasp!)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Aw shit, close one. But also kinda awesome. For a second there, I saw Father's hand reaching out for me.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...That...was...awful...!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, you actually talked!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
So...reckless!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, don't sweat it!  
What matters is that we made it here!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Woo! Yeah, time to SMASH!  
That oughta help all the other slowpokes catch up!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh...  
UhhhhhhAAAAAAHHH!!!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Whoa, hey!  
I didn't mean right this secon&ndash;Ah, dammit...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Eh, screw it. Might as well kick this party off with my Noble Phantasm!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Clarent Blood Arthur!  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
That was reckless and ridiculous, but it was very helpful! Now's our chance to head inside the gardens.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I'll switch back to my terminal after we land.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you sure it's okay to leave this body unattended?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Without my soul inside it,  
it's basically an oversized monster costume.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
It'd be kind of annoying if it were destroyed,  
but if it comes to that, I'll just make a new one!  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Good, we made it.  
Now to switch back...!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...There we go.  
Now come on, let's hurry.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
The Assassin of Red, Semiramis.  
The Lancer of Red, Karna.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
And the Lancer of Black, Vlad III.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Since we have other Servants on our side,  
we'll have to defeat them, no matter what.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...It's possible these three are the ones seeking the Greater Grail.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Even Karna...?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
True, that would be very out of character,  
so it's probably not Karna.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
If there's anyone who wants the Greater Grail more than anything...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...it would have to be that other man.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, there they are.  
'Sup, Custodian?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uhhh...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
So you're all right...  
How about you, Frankenstein? Are you okay?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Never...again.  
Ever.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
(Wow! It was so bad it actually got her to speak...!)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, just 'cause our opponents can think doesn't mean they can really THINK, right?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Best they can do is some normal,  
orthodox planning, y'know?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
So I figured if we hit them with a reckless, batshit insane plan like mine, where one false step would get you killed, they'd HAVE to fall for it!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
So you actually thought that far ahead...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm not sure I'd call it “thinking”...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Well it was, dammit!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm thinking this was dumb luck. Like, really dumb luck.  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh, uh!  
(Vigorous nod)  
  
   
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, we're up against that bitchy empress who owns these gardens, right?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Not really sure why,  
but that lady seriously pisses me off!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Besides, even if we'd been on the same team during the war, I bet we'd have been at each other's throats the entire time anyway!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
(She's certainly got that right.)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
All right, Master of Chaldea!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Just point us at whoever's face we need to smash in!  
  
   
## Section 7: Decisive Battle: Hanging Gardens  
   
**Mordred:**   
Get...OUTTA HERE!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
All right!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Fujimaru!  
Hold out your fist!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
M-my fist?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okay?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
We won! Hell yeah! WINNER, WINNER, CHICKEN DINNER!!! Awww yeah!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Is your hand okay?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I-I dunno... I can't...feel it anymore...  
   
**Sieg:**   
I think Mordred just sort of...forgot you're a normal human.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Forget “okay.” Do...do I still have a hand?  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh, uh.  
(You do.)  
  
   
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
I have ascended!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Mr. Muscleman! It's about time!  
Hiya.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...I can't believe you actually climbed all the way here during that fierce battle...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
That rope held up really well!  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Indeed. It is a rope with a rebellious spirit!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you okay? Can you still fight?  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Rebelling against oppressors is my greatest love AND greatest power!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
It'll be morning soon...but the Hanging Gardens are still here, just like we thought they'd be.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I'm guessing the Assassin of Red joined our side after we won that last battle.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Which means these gardens belong to both our enemy, and our ally.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Right you are.  
Your plan was rash, but successful.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...There you are.  
The Assassin of Red, Semiramis.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
I have a fairly good idea of what's going on here.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
It was your negligence that led to this situation.  
Wasn't it, Custodian?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...You may be right.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
The last wish remaining in this Greater Grail was one that should never be granted, but it was also nobler than any other wish had ever been.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I never thought about touching it myself.  
I couldn't have even if I wanted to.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
That explains it.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
No wonder a mere human, a mere mage,  
a mere Master, made it so far then.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...Does that mean you know who our enemy is?  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Oh yes, I know him all too well. I may not have my memories of the war either, but I do have these gardens.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
As such, it was a trivial matter to learn of him.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Ahh, it seems another has been revived.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...Forgive me. We really made you work back there.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Don't worry about it. I will admit, though, that your attack was so powerful, it's almost a shame we're on the same side now.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Thank you.  
Indeed, I wish we could have had a proper battle.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
All of you, come with me. Now that thirteen of us have been revived, night and day no longer matter.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Our enemy awaits us before the Greater Grail.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Our enemy?  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Yes, our enemy.  
A man, Master of Chaldea.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
The only Master other than you in this entire world.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I have lost. Leave me be, and continue onward.  
I regret that I have no gift for you apart from my defeat.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Captured.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Armor of gold, godkiller lance, lone kshatriya of the great Mahabharata, warrior, brave, Hero of Benefaction.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Karna.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But...I am tired now. Tired enough even to forgive your deception. ...What's more, I have lost.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Captured.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
The oldest known poisoner, the empress as dreadful as she is beautiful, the queen of Assyria who desired not love, but power.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Semiramis.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Thirteen Servants in total. And now, I have perfect reproduction data for all of them.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Enough to begin the Great Holy Grail War once again.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Soon, I will reach the number of battles needed to shut down the wish made upon the Grail...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...and tamper with it myself.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...I reach out my hand, over and over and over.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
I copied thirteen Servants, created shadows,  
and set the stage as best I could.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
I am the only one left, and now,  
I shall become the final Servant.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
My control over the system has reached eighty-seven percent. More than enough to grant my wish.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
And yet... And yet, and yet, and yet...!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
I am unable to speak my wish aloud!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
You... You would still resist me...!?  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Of course. Under normal circumstances, this system would not even grant the likes of you an audience.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
It matters not how many years it was in your possession. It was another, far greater mage who did the work, not you.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Enough is enough, you cheap imitation of Vlad III.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Imitation?  
   
**Semiramis:**   
That's right.  
This man is no Servant.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
And yet, he is also Vlad III.  
  
   
  
   
**Mordred:**   
How the hell's that work?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I explained this to Fujimaru once before.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
He was the Master who desired the Greater Grail more than anyone, save for myself and a certain priest.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
He was the leader of the Black team,  
and the head of the Yggdmillennia family.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
And he was the mage who hid the Greater Grail and studied it himself for sixty years.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
He desired the Greater Grail so much that he betrayed the Lancer of Black, Vlad III...his own Servant.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
He is Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
...  
...Haha, hahaha, hahaha!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
So, with the exception of the Extra class,  
every Heroic Spirit from the war is assembled here!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
Along with the homunculus who stole the Greater Grail from me! From mankind itself!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
Khh... Ahh, the pain.  
I can feel my psyche slipping away.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
But that doesn't matter anymore,  
as the reproduction is perfect.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...So you still desire the Greater Grail,  
even though your soul is practically falling apart?  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
A tool, a THING like you could never understand.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
No, none of you heroes could ever understand.  
You've always had power to fall back on.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
Not me. I worked myself to the bone. I racked my brain studying magecraft so intensely it nearly killed me!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
I extended my life even as I lived in fear. I threw myself into a Holy Grail War! I commanded armies! Betrayed my allies!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
I'm not like the three families who let their own indolence guide them until they lost sight of the goal!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
I'M the one who wanted this Greater Grail more than anyone! I'M the one who desired it most!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Whether or not that is true,  
Darnic has been dead for a long time now.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
The thing speaking now is nothing more than the lingering desires left behind after his death.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The desire...left behind...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Yes.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...As I said earlier, he betrayed Vlad III,  
right before he died.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
He used a Command Spell to force Vlad III to transform into a vampire and then merged with him.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
the result was a horrid monster, neither human nor vampire.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
But even that did not gain him the Greater Grail. A priest who was a Master for the Red team defeated him, you see.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
That should have been the end of it.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
When a Servant dies, they dissolve into purified magical energy, and are absorbed by the Greater Grail.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
...But that did not happen with him.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Most likely because he was still...human.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Yes, that's part of it...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...but it's also because Darnic consumed the souls of infants to extend his life.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Now, he is neither human, nor Servant.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
He is just a...thing. One driven solely by the desire to win the Holy Grail for itself.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
That is all this “Darnic” is.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Damn... Sounds more like putting down a rabid dog than kicking ass!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
The Greater Grail is close to falling apart. You won't even be able to activate the Third Magic, let alone reach the Root.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Give it up.  
Your dream ended long ago.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
Oh no it didn't! Not yet!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
Have you forgotten what I told you earlier?  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
I now control eighty-seven percent of the Greater Grail's system.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
I will make far better use of it than you ever would!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
All you've ever done with its power is sit around waiting for someone who will never come!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
What an odd thing to say. How can you make use of the Greater Grail's power when you're dead...?  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
Dead, alive, it doesn't matter.  
I will always seek to control the Greater Grail!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
Once I have it, my wish will finally be granted...!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...I see.  
So now you are little more than a vengeful spirit.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
But this would benefit all of you very much as well.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
As long as I control the Greater Grail,  
none of you will ever die again.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
You would have a second&ndash;no,  
a third lease on life!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
But, if I am defeated, and this Great Holy Grail War comes to an end...  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
...all of you will disappear as well.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
...Now, Custodian, which is the better choice?  
In fact, let me make it simpler.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
Would you rather have a third chance at life,  
or just vanish with no one to remember you!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
I swear to you all now,  
on my honor as a Yggdmillennia...  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
...I will ensure that you all leave this Greater Grail, and are incarnated in the real world!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
You will be free to do as you wish. You may make your own dreams come true, or simply wander as you please.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
I have no intention of commanding you as my Servants.  
Whatever you decide will be your business, not mine.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...  
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What're you gonna do...!?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I...I have no right to compel them one way or the other.  
I am the Custodian. Nothing more.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Even if they are just reproductions, they're still conscious beings with their own unique personalities.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I can't order them to their deaths.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...Man, Sieg, you're way beyond being a downer, you know that? You can be completely exhausting sometimes.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Hey, Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Hate to break it to you,  
but I'm gonna have to pass.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
Oh? And why is that?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Easy. 'Cause I wouldn't really be a hero if I went along with you now, would I?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
We're meant to live life to the fullest. Even if you trip up along the way, that doesn't invalidate what happened before the fall, or after.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
And reproduction or not, Servant or not,  
as long as I'm still me...  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...I'm not doing anything that a real hero wouldn't do.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...  
...Tch.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
For once, you carrot-looking weirdo,  
we're on the same page!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Carrot-looking weirdo!?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I can't really say I got the cleanest hands around here...but that sure as hell doesn't mean I'll be siding with you!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Even I'd feel pretty gross going along with your plan.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
How 'bout you, empress lady?  
You gonna side with this ass?  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Don't be a fool.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
The most generous offer I make to those who challenge me is a swift death.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...Indeed.  
I cannot consent to your proposal.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I share Achilles's view.  
I will not dishonor the life I led before.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
And I am certain Karna agrees with me.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
You can certainly try to prolong your own life if you wish, but I'm afraid I have no interest in that myself.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
I went to my death knowing I had done what I had to. Now, my only obligation is to lend my strength to those with goals to achieve.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Likewise.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
I can only carry out my work when I have been summoned properly. I therefore cannot go along with your plan.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
As for me, I refuse simply because you presume to order me about.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
If you take issue with that,  
then defeat me and prove you are right.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Oh I am toootally siding with these nice people!  
Yeppers!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Weeell...maybe I should side with you since I was on the Black team and all...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
...but, naaah, can't do it!  
The hero in me has gotta stop you!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Perhaps one of my many famous lines will suit here:  
“Let the end try the man.”  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
So I am most resolutely opposed to your plan as well!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Certainly it can make a good story when a hero turns to evil, but such hackneyed plot twists are beneath me!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh.  
(Shaking head)  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
?  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Death to the oppressor.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Hmm... No, we don't like it.  
You're a great mage.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We hate people like you!  
Oh, but not you, Mommy!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
You're a hack of a mage!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry for being bad.  
   
**Jack:**   
That's why we love you!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thanks, Jack!  
   
**Jack:**   
You're welcome!  
  
   
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...There you have it, Sir Darnic.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
We are not pawns to be used however you like.  
We are alive, with our own minds and opinions.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Even if we are just reproductions...  
No, BECAUSE we are reproductions...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...we cannot abandon our pride as heroes.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
...Oh well, I thought things might turn out this way.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
So I suppose I will just have you keep fighting until you change your minds!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
Pseudo-Greater Grail...connected!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
It can't be... You're going to reproduce the Greater Grail INSIDE the Greater Grail!?  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
You're out of your mind! That's like trying to create a parallel mirror world with brute force!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
...And I'm quite all right with that.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
For how can one be a mage without traversing the realms of the absurd?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
That wish may be wrong, but as it is your wish,  
I am sure it seems right to you.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
But...that doesn't mean I'm going to let you have it.  
Because your wish DIDN'T come true.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
As the Greater Grail's Custodian,  
I WILL defeat you!  
  
   
## Section 8: Yggdmillennia  
   
**Mordred:**   
The hell's going on here!?  
They just keep coming no matter how many we kill!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
And what the hell is this? He's weirdly hard to fight!  
It's like one minute it's a Saber, then an Archer...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
It is most likely all of them!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
He's using data from all seven of our classes to give himself an advantage against us!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
What!? Isn't that cheating or something?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
It is one of the fundaments of combat!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
In battle, you strike at your opponent's weaknesses,  
and make the battle as difficult for them as possible.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...But, with that in mind...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...there is no reason we can't do the same.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Sir Sieg, Master, please keep the orders coming!  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
The Greater Grail is basing its pseudo-combatants on our battle data.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
It must be choosing classes and tactics depending on the current situation.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Fair enough. Then let's do this:  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Have all thirteen of us and Sir Sieg work together.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
If Darnic's residual thoughts refuse to shut down of their own accord, we will just have to overwhelm them with combat data until they collapse in on themselves!  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Sounds fine to me.  
Our job is the same either way.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Master of Chaldea, your orders, please.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Hmm. These may not be my true gardens,  
but they are still mine.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
I suppose it would be amusing to completely obliterate them.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
If I may, Empress, have some consideration for us noncombatants! That includes Master, you'll recall!  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
No.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
I think you may have gotten on her bad side.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
...But, no matter. If that is our plan,  
I'll go ahead and use the walls to make more golems.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just be sure to leave the floor alone, please!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...?  
...???  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh, uh.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Okay, she says we just gotta pound his face in!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Did you really just take instructions from a Berserker?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Shut up, you freakin' exhibitionist!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Wha...!  
  
   
**H：Atalante:**   
How dare you call me an exhibitionist!?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
(Hmm... She still went back to her old outfit, though.)  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
The lines between good and evil are ill-defined in this.  
We are not fighting as proper Servants, either.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...But then again, there has never been such a thing as a perfect person.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Instead of lamenting that which we lack, let us fight here and now for that which we already possess!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Now I get it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Get what?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Well, I was so caught up in my own responsibility to fix this predicament...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...that I forgot they have their own responsibilities as heroes.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Even if they are just copies, they still have pride.  
Without that, a Servant is no more than a shadow.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Fujimaru, we need your orders now more than ever.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
This is the final battle, the last chance we'll likely ever have to fight by each other's sides.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
It'll be sad to go our separate ways,  
but it's time to wake from this dream.  
  
   
## Section 9: "Returning to Tranquil Slumber"  
   
**Darnic:**   
No... Not yet... I can still fight...  
I haven't given up yet... This isn't over...!  
  
   
**B：???:**  
Yes, it is.  
Dreams end, people die, and heroes rest in peace.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
Wha...!  
  
   
**B：???:**  
Kazikli Bey.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
You... You were copied too!?  
No... It can't be...!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
I sealed you away!  
I made sure you could never be copied!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
You should have been no more than a puppet based on battle data!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
How could you possibly manifest as a Servant capable of thinking for himself...?  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
It should have been impossible, Lancer!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
After tens of thousands of battles,  
this was inevitable.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Well done, all of you.  
Your valiant efforts succeeded in summoning me...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...a Servant capable of defeating Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
Laaannnceeerrr...!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
My anger is long gone;  
my modest ambitions are long since quashed.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Is that not true for you as well?  
The time has come to accept your fate.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Indeed, you MUST accept it.  
Otherwise, you will never move forward.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Your thoughts and dreams can go no further.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Darnic, my Master, and my sworn enemy.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
What...?  
You...you have your memories...!?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Indeed. Of all fourteen Servants, I am the only one who retains memories of the Great Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Perhaps that is thanks to your absorbing me.  
It is not, however, why I wish to defeat you.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
No, my wish to defeat you stems from neither a desire for revenge, nor anger, but my duty as a hero...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...and the mercy I feel for you as your Servant.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
Mercy...?  
Don't give me that nonsense, Lancer!  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
You expect me to believe you no longer bear a grudge!?  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
I trampled your pride as a hero into dust!  
You MUST despise me for that!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...Then let me ask you this.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
If I strike you down now,  
will you die despising me?  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
...What...?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Do you truly not understand, Darnic?  
You would hold no grudge.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
You may be angry, but that anger would not persist eternally.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
We both have dreams we have chosen to pursue, even as we have resigned ourselves to the fact that they will not be realized.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Even though, deep down, we have given up on our dreams, we still fight to pursue them.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
It is an act of irreverence. We do not do so out of respect for anyone or anything else.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
We do so because our ambitions...our dreams...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...are the one thing to which we will always be loyal.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Even if others decry you as fork-tongued for your scheming, or fear me as the Impaler for the mountain of bodies I piled up...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...that loyalty is the one thing we cannot change.  
That is why our dreams stay with us.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...I'm afraid this is likely beyond your understanding, Custodian. But perhaps, in the fullness of time...that will change.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I understand you all too well, Darnic.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I know that your hard work, your betrayals,  
your plots...are nothing to be ashamed of.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
And that is precisely why this scheme of yours must end now.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
For if it does not, you will have betrayed even your own dreams.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
And dreams that have been compromised will never shine bright again.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
...  
...Ahh, dammit.  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
...It's no wonder I summoned you,  
Lancer... Vlad III...  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
...If you find my dream beautiful...maybe...that's enough...  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
Yes... I can finally stop walking...  
I'm exhausted... This is hard work for an old man...  
  
   
**Darnic:**   
I suppose, in the end...dreams that have been tainted and broken...simply can't be mended...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Is it...over?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
It is. The Great Holy Grail War has well and truly come to an end.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Custodian.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Y-yes?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I do not know you, but now that you have taken the Greater Grail, you are responsible for it.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...Though I'm sure you are well aware of that.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Yes. I promise I'll take good care of it.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Now, let me give you a word of advice.  
Not as a hero, but as a human.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Humans will come.  
It is inevitable.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
And they WILL discover magic,  
with or without the Greater Grail.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
But regardless, an excellent ending awaits you.  
Take solace in that, and sleep well.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Now then, I think I shall take my leave.  
Farewell.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Hmph. I never thought he would have the nerve to act like a king in my presence.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
That is why I was magnanimous enough to stay silent during his little speech. ...Besides, the gardens are about to collapse.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Here, I will teleport the lot of you back to the ground.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
I will remain here, and spend what time I have left with my gardens.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Try to stop me, and your already short life will end even more abruptly.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
...I heard that, you insolent fool!  
Now be off with you!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, I didn't say shit!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I could've sworn you said something about “stink.”  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Never mind that. Go on, all of you!  
Back to the ground with you!  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Hmph. They certainly were a noisy bunch.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Ahh, I can finally relax now.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
...The Great Holy Grail War, huh.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
When I was summoned here, did I have a wish of my own? One worth creating these gardens for...?  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
And if I did...what was it?  
Was...it for someone in particular...?  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
...Heh. I suppose none of that matters now...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
That damn stink bug woman!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's an awful thing to say!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I knew you were saying something like that!  
   
**Mordred:**   
Ah, piss off! Just seeing face of hers...she NEEDS to be insulted!  
  
   
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Well, whatever.  
At least all THAT'S over with!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Welp, see you around, Chaldean!  
Oh, hey, am I there too?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
If I am, make sure you ride my ass into the ground!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Bye for now!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uh!  
(Salute)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Salute)  
   
**Fran:**   
Uhn!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Wave goodbye)  
   
**Fran:**   
Uhn♪  
  
   
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They really came in AND left like a storm...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
That they did.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
The oppressor is dead.  
The mage's dream has now gone.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
My work here is done.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Now, I must be off! There are oppressors in other lands that must be defeated!  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
...Farewell!  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Well, that certainly...happened.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Much has transpired,  
but I believe I have done all I could.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Young speedster.  
You...  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
On second thought, you can wait.  
I will go on ahead.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Huh? You're leaving already!?  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
Goodbyes are best kept brief,  
and reunions celebrated heartily.  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
See you around.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Hmm.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...Not nearly tragic enough to suit me.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Isn't that a good thing?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Don't be silly! A great tragedy is just the thing to spice up a happy ending!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...Still, that Darnic fellow did bow out rather beautifully, so I suppose that must satisfy me.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Even in death, he was a man so driven to make his dream come true that he went to the trouble of recreating us.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Being as I rather walked the straight and narrow in my lifetime, I cannot but feel the touch of the green-eyed monster myself...  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Straight and narrow, huh?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good one, Shakespeare!  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
That was no joke!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
“Straight and narrow.” (Stifle laughter)  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Good [♂ sir /♀ madam], I do believe you have offended me...  
  
   
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
...At any rate, this is goodbye.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Hmm. Master of Chaldea,  
I don't know about the Custodian...  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
...but I have a feeling you and I will meet again someday.  
In fact, perhaps we already have.  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
...Hm. What an odd thing for me to say...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Very well then, everyone!  
I bid you all farewell!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Since brevity is the soul of wit, and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I shall be brief!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I believe that will suffice to fill my quota for quotations! Farewell!  
  
   
**Avicebron:**   
Good grief...  
  
   
**Karna:**   
All right, I'd better be on my way too.  
I have nothing else to say.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Because we're such good friends now?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Because saying goodbye would just make you sad?  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...Am I that easy to read...?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Ohhh... This means we have to say goodbye,  
doesn't it, Mommy?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I'm sorry...  
I'm sure you'll miss [♂ him /♀ her].  
  
   
**Jack:**   
No we won't.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We already have a connection with Mommy.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Even if WE aren't in Chaldea...we're sure Mommy will keep our connection alive with the other us.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
So it will be fine. Right, Mr. Custodian?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I see.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Thank you, Jack. You were a big help.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Oh! You're welcome!  
We will let you off the hook for killing us, then!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Just kidding.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We don't know what happened back then,  
and we don't remember it either.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
So we have nothing to forgive or not forgive you for.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Ever since we were born, we just like to play!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Well, bye-bye, Mr. Custodian!  
Maybe we'll see you again sometime?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
An endlessly wandering Assassin,  
all because they don't remember her, huh...  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Hey! Hey! Custodian!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Y-yes?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Were you avoiding me?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
No, of course&ndash;okay, maybe I was.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
I thought so.  
But not 'cause you don't like me, right?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Why would I dislike you?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
HEY! N-no answering questions with questions!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Now I get it. You were just shy!  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...Yes, I suppose I was.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
It's sort of awkward to meet someone again after you've already said goodbye, even if they don't remember having done so.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
...Gotcha.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
But hey! The me you knew was still meee, right?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Of course.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
You helped me out so many times.  
I was proud to have you as my Servant.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
...Thanks.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Well, see you again sometime!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
All right, I suppose I'd better be on my way as well.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Sir Custodian...had you been the evil dragon I faced, perhaps we could have resolved our differences peacefully.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
That way, I would never have had to bathe in the blood of a dragon.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But&ndash;  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I know.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
If I hadn't been immortal, I might have died in a ditch somewhere, without anyone ever knowing my name.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
No, I don't think so...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Even if you never bathed in dragon's blood,  
or came into possession of Balmung...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I'm certain you would still have been a hero.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...Thank you, Custodian.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Thank you for thinking so well of me,  
and for fighting alongside me.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Welp, guess we'd better hit the road too, Teacher.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Indeed. For a while, I was rather uncertain how this would all turn out...  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
...but it ended up being much more fun than I anticipated.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
This battle lasted but a few days, and is unlikely to become part of history in any real sense.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
So I hope that, if nothing else, it will remain in your memories, [♂ Sir /♀ Lady] Fujimaru.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course. I'll never forget it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It will. And I'll remember all of you, too. I promise.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
We have a connection now.  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Once I have been summoned, I will spend every free moment I have holding classes on&ndash;  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Hm? You already have a great many teachers?  
  
   
**Chiron:**   
Hmm, interesting. In that case, I would love to pit our different teaching styles against one another!  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...So, we really won this, huh?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Back when I was alive, even though my life was one battle after another...or maybe even because of it...  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...I couldn't ever really relax after winning,  
'cause I knew the next battle was never far off.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
But now...I guess I don't have to worry about that anymore.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...That's actually kinda nice, in its own way.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It is?  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Yeah. I'm...satisfied.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
I don't have any grudges, and no civilians around means there were no massacres or other atrocities.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Oh, and it's nice that Hektor's not here either.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you really do hate him?  
   
**Achilles:**   
Nah, not...exactly.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
If you ever end up summoning me,  
I'll figure out a way to get along with him.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...Yeah, it'll work out.  
Just gotta think positive.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I take it you don't get along?  
   
**Achilles:**   
Hmm... Well, let's just say we went through a lot together, and most of it was less than friendly.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
That said, I'm a Servant now. I'm sure if I got summoned,  
I'd forget any problems I had with him.  
  
   
  
   
**Achilles:**   
...But that's not what I'm really trying to say.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
What I really want to say is that I bet I could have a lot of fun fighting alongside you guys again.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
So if you ever find yourself in a tight spot in Greece, just gimme a call.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
I'll come running, no matter when or where you are.  
Promise.  
  
   
**Achilles:**   
Thanks for everything.  
...This was a really good battle.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Now that the Greater Grail is stable again,  
this world is about to disappear.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
Give me your hand.  
It's time we returned to the real world.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Here we are. Now, at last...I can wait here, secure in the knowledge that the Greater Grail will be safe.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You know, I really have to ask...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who are you waiting for, anyway?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...I'm afraid I can't tell you that.  
It's a secret.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Gotcha.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I know I shouldn't be keeping anything from you, but...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's fine. I get it.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Are you sure?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Some things aren't for anyone else to know. Not even friends.  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yes, but in exchange, I want you to be my friend.  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...Me... Your friend?  
  
   
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...I see.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
All this time, I thought that you and I...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...were more like an oppressor and his victim than anything else.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What!? No! Not even close!  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
So, you would call me your friend?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...Thank you. I will always cherish this memory.  
But, there's something else I need to say.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
There is nothing I can do for you,  
nothing I can give you after all you did for me.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
All I could do was stand around...even with all those heroes willing to risk their lives helping.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I can't tell you how sorry I am about that.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's fine. Really.  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...That only makes me feel worse.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't worry. This was fun.  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Fun, huh?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
You're a very positive person,  
aren't you, Fujimaru? I'm afraid I...  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...Hm?  
You know, now that I think of it, I had fun too.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Even though I genuinely feared for my life back when we were fighting... Strange.  
  
   
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
...Anyway, I'm sure you still have a long, difficult road ahead.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
It may not be much&ndash;hell, it may not even be welcome&ndash;but, I'd like to help you on it, if I can.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
So...since I am the Greater Grail's Custodian,  
I'm going to repurpose the terminal I made earlier.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So, does that mean...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sieg?  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
I can still function as a terminal, but since my connection to my true body will be cut off...  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...I'll only be able to use my dragon power for a fraction of an instant.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
...But, if that's okay with you...I'd still like to do whatever I can to help you out.  
  
   
**Sieg:**   
It's the least I can do for someone who considers me a friend.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
There. Now I really can rest easy.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you're going to stay here until this person shows up?  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Yes. I don't mind waiting.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Not even if it takes them a hundred,  
or a thousand, or ten thousand years.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
You see, I know for certain that they will get here eventually.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I have all the faith in the world in them.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Farewell...my friend. And thank you.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
We may not have spent much time together, but I'll cherish it forever. It will always be a precious memory to me.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Goodbye, Sieg.  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Goodbye, Fujimaru.  
Take care.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
I hope my terminal will be of at least some use to you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Take care of yourself.  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
You too, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Evil Dragon:**   
Goodbye, my friend.  
My new Master.  
  
   
  
   
**Narration:**   
I'm not worried about all this waiting.  
If anything, my conviction is now certainty.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...It was a fleeting encounter,  
and a fleeting farewell.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But it doesn't bother me.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
The sorrow of parting may make my heart ache,  
but even that is drowned out by a great swell of joy.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Those few short days I spent with [♂ him /♀ her] gave me boundless hope for mankind.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It was a short battle.  
A small fight to the death.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Still, I'm sure that man had no choice but to fight,  
no matter how much pain it brought him.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I can't say that was beautiful,  
but I can't say it was ugly, either.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...I can no longer track my terminal.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Soon, he will be summoned as a Servant,  
and aid Fujimaru in [♂ his /♀ her] battles.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
From now on, he will be making his own memories.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
In time, Sieg will become a Servant totally separate from me, and forge his own path.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I only hope he is at least some small help to Fujimaru in the struggles ahead.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
For my part, I think I'll go back to sleep.  
...I wonder when I'll wake?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Whenever it is, I don't mind.  
This tiny, sealed-off world will not change any longer.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But if something were somehow to change,  
I am sure it would be for the better.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
For now, I sleep, forever and ever...waiting for the future that I know will one day come.
