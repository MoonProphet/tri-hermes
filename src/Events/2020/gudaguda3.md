# GUDAGUDA Mystery of the Imperial Capital's Holy Grail  
   
## Final Section: Alter  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Oda Nobunaga:**   
...I thought it might go this way.  
In the end, it's down to you and me.  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Oda Nobunaga:**   
Not that you have any fight left in you now.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Why, Nobbu...!?  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
No... Oda Nobunaga, Demon King of the Sixth Heaven!!!  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Oda Nobunaga:**   
Hmph. You could never understand what I fight for.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Answer me! Why did you do it...!?  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Why did you lay your hands on Master!?  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Oda Nobunaga:**   
Because [♂ he /♀ she] was in the way.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Wha...!?  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Oda Nobunaga:**   
...All who stand in my way must be destroyed.  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Oda Nobunaga:**   
No one can stop me.  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Oda Nobunaga:**   
Once I vanquish you and use this Maxwell Reactor,  
I will defy history itself to make everything my domain!  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Your domain...?  
That's...THAT'S why Chacha, Mr. Hijikata...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
...and Master all had to die!?  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Oda Nobunaga:**   
Enough talk.  
My flames will consume you soon.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
...Chacha...  
...Mr. Hijikata...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
...Master...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
I...  
I...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Wh-what is this...!?  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
This light... I can feel everyone's hopes and dreams within it...!!!  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Oda Nobunaga:**   
What!? You...!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
I am the true Okita Souji...the strongest Okita Souji.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
I am Okita Souji Alter!  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
...That's how Alters are SUPPOSED to happen, right?  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
So how did this happen!?  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
You, what, just woke up one morning and were suddenly an Alter? That's silly and I'm not buying it!  
  
   
**Okita Alter?:**  
...  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
   
Well!? Say something, Okita!  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
And what's with that color palette, anyway!?  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
You look like a tryhard noob!  
  
   
**A：Oda Nobunaga:**   
Huh? You got a tan because you just randomly fell asleep with the lights on? Come on! I've heard of sensitive skin but that's nuts!  
  
   
**A：Oda Nobunaga:**   
   
ANYWAY!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
So this is Auntie losing it...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Chacha remembers His Imperial Highness once said that she threw a pair of zori at him for no reason!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
So, Okita...Alter, was it?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Your skin looks so much healthier now.  
Chacha approves of your new look.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Oh, would you like some tea?  
It's Chacha's special matcha!  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
Stop that! This is no time for TEA!  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
Right, Fujimaru?  
You agree with me, don't you!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I am so confused...  
   
**Okita Alter?:**  
...  
  
   
**Okita Alter?:**  
...I see.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hey, wait! You killed me, Nobbu!?  
   
**Nobbu:**   
Huh? I did?  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
Well, given the subject,  
I guess it can't be helped, right?  
  
   
  
   
**Chacha:**   
So what about the original Okita?  
Is there anything left of her?  
  
   
**Okita Alter?:**  
...  
  
   
**Okita Alter?:**  
So these...  
  
   
**Okita Alter?:**  
...are your memories, Master...  
  
   
**Okita Alter?:**  
...Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Okita Alter?:**  
...Thank you.  
  
   
**Okita Alter?:**  
...I'm glad I got to see your Chaldea in the end.  
  
   
## Section 1: Imperial Capital  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? What is this place?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Am I dreaming again?  
   
  
   
**D：Citizen:**   
...Hey! What're you standing around for!?  
  
   
**D：Citizen:**   
Can't you hear the alarm!?  
You've gotta get as far away from here as you can!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Excuse me, can you tell me where we are?  
   
**D：Citizen:**   
Huh? What're you talking about!?  
This is the Imperial Capital, Tokyo! Obviously!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Alarm?  
   
**D：Citizen:**   
Hurry up, before you get caught in their cross fire!  
  
   
  
   
**D：Citizen:**   
Fine, then! If you and your weird outfit are so eager to die, then stay there!  
  
   
**C：Mini Nobu:**   
Nobbuuu!  
  
   
**D：Citizen:**   
   
Aaaaaahhh!!!  
I'm too late!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, it's just a Mini Nobu.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
NOW what's Nobbu up to?  
   
  
   
**Mini Nobu?:**  
Nobbu!  
  
   
**D：Citizen:**   
...Wh-why?  
I'm a good...imperial citizen...  
  
   
**Mini Nobu?:**  
Nobbuuu!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...I've gotta get out of here!  
   
  
   
**Mini Nobu?:**  
Nobu nobuuu!  
  
   
**E：Citizen:**   
P-please, h-help...!  
  
   
**E：Citizen:**   
Aaaaaahhh!  
  
   
**Mini Nobu?:**  
Nobu nobu!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I've just gotta find a way out!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nobbu! Oh, great timing!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nobbu...?  
   
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Oof, that hurt!)  
   
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
How dare you talk to me like that.  
Who do you think I am?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
I'm Oda Nobunaga, the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven. Don't you forget it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's going on...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm passing out...  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Hmm, so you're an outsider.  
And here I thought you were one of Caster's people...  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Seems I was worried over nothing.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...Die.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...And who are you?  
  
   
**A：???:**  
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Aren't you...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Okita?  
   
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...If that oversized sword you carry is anything to go by,  
I take it you are a Saber?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
And on top of that,  
you're that little [♂ boy's /♀ girl's] Servant?  
  
   
**A：???:**  
...  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
To think there was a Servant here still bound to a Master...  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Interesting... I don't know where you came from, but no one comes strolling into my territory and gets away with it.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
You Sabers are supposed to be the most powerful of the classes, right? Then let's see what you've got!  
  
   
**A：???:**  
...!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**A：???:**  
...!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Is that all...?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Is that the best a member of the vaunted Saber class can do? I may as well be fighting a child.  
  
   
**A：???:**  
...Mas...ter...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Are you okay?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...I've gotta do something!  
   
  
   
**A：???:**  
...I'm...kay...!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
What is it?  
...Are you a mute?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Hmph, what a letdown...  
I guess this is going to be yet another dull battle.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
I've had enough of you. Begone.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Fwahahaha, sorry to keep you waiting, weakling.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Huh? You deflected the bullet?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...What is even happening right now?  
   
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
You...deflected my shot?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
As if your bullets would ever work on me. Idiot.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Hey, human, are you still alive?  
If not, would it be all right to eat you?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Hey, stop that.  
[♂ He's /♀ She's] an important guest, after all.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Oh, yes, hello there. Pleasure to make your acquaintance, Archer. Or, would you prefer...  
  
   
**D：???:**  
...Lady Oda Nobunaga.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...Who are you?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
What should we do, Boss?  
Do we kill her? ...Please?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
No, let's fall back for now; I'm worried about  
[♂ his /♀ her] wound. Would you like to come with us too?  
  
   
**A：???:**  
...O...kay.  
  
   
**A：???:**  
...I...see.  
  
   
**A：???:**  
...So these are words. I know them now.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
What? You can talk after all?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...No, wait. You LEARNED how to talk?  
  
   
**A：???:**  
...  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Hmph. Well, no matter. Did you really think I would let you escape just because this rabble showed up?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Don't bother. Not gonna work, remember?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
...So anyway, you want me to carry the [♂ guy /♀ girl]?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Yes, please. As gently as possible, if you don't mind.  
And you, Servant, I take it you can still move?  
  
   
**A：???:**  
...Yes, I'm okay.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Good. This way, Oryou!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Oh, no you don't...  
All of you, get after them!  
  
   
**Mini Nobu?:**  
Nobu nobuuu!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Now, let's take a look at your wound.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Hmm... You're still bleeding quite a lot,  
but at least the bullet didn't hit anything vital.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
You can die if you would like. Don't worry.  
You will make a delicious dinner if you do. For me, yes.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
What have I told you about saying things like that, Oryou?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who are you two?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Thank you for helping me, but who...?  
   
  
   
**D：???:**  
Ah yes, I haven't introduced myself yet, have I?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
My name is Sakamoto Ryouma, a Rider.  
And this place...  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
...is the Imperial Capital, Tokyo.  
  
   
## Section 2: Pulsation  
   
**Narration:**   
...Meanwhile, somewhere in the city...  
  
   
**Officer:**   
...I'm here to make my regular report,  
General Amami.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
Earlier this morning, June ●, 1945,  
during the ■th Holy Grail War...  
  
   
**Officer:**   
...we confirmed territory boundary conflicts with three Servants.  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
...Hmm. Earlier than usual.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
Given the total number of Servants materialized,  
this falls within an acceptable margin of error.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
We have also confirmed that their classes are Archer, Saber, and Lancer.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
Each one established their own territory and started to fight.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
Given the other classes' traits, and the fact that they're currently competing with each other...  
  
   
**Officer:**   
...we have not yet apprehended them or defined them.  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
I see. Things got a little out of hand last time, so do make sure things go off without a hitch this time around.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
Yes, sir.  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
Three Knight classes, then?  
Tell me what we're dealing with here.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
The Saber was a modern-day swordmaster.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
The Lancer was an old-fashioned samurai warrior wielding a spear.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
And the Archer...  
Well, I have her True Name right here.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
...Is this right!?  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
What is it?  
  
   
**Officer:**   
M-my apologies, sir.  
It seems the Archer is...  
  
   
**Officer:**   
...THE Oda Nobunaga.  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
...What!?  
Did you say...Oda Nobunaga?  
  
   
**Officer:**   
Yes, sir. That's what our scouts are telling us.  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
...  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
...Heh.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
...Are you all right, sir?  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
...Yes, I'm fine. What's the latest on our Heroic Spirit Soldier deployment?  
  
   
**Officer:**   
We've deployed two garrisons at key points in the Imperial Capital.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
They're currently focused on maintaining the peace and conducting force reconnaissance.  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
I see. Continue to monitor those three Servants.  
The survival of our Imperial Capital may depend upon it.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
Yes, sir!  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
...You're dismissed.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
Understood, sir.  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
...Hehe.  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
...Hehahahahaha!  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
Haaahahahahahahahaha!  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
At last...!  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
At last, you have returned...!  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
Lady Nobunaga!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Aww, [♂ he's /♀ she's] still alive.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Get away from [♂ him /♀ her].  
  
   
**D：???:**  
...Hmph. Another chance to eat [♂ him /♀ her] wasted.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
...Are you all right, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...What is this place?  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Well, it looks like you're all right now.  
Looks like your saliva worked, Oryou.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Hehe, there's nothing Oryou's saliva can't cure.  
Too bad. If [♂ he'd /♀ she'd] died, I could've eaten [♂ him /♀ her].  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thanks for saving me.  
   
**C：???:**  
...  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
It would seem you're all right now.  
She never left your side this whole time, you know.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
She never gave me a chance to eat you.  
Stupid Saber.  
  
   
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
To your question, we are in my humble detective agency, tucked away in a corner of Tokyo.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
And this is my assistant, Oryou.  
My apologies for not introducing her sooner.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Yaaay.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
She's not a Servant,  
but she's just as capable as one.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You sure she's not stronger than most Servants?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I saw her deflect that bullet like it was nothing.  
   
  
   
**Oryou:**   
That is a super-classified Oryou trade secret.  
Still, you're really durable, for a human.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
And I'm Sakamoto Ryouma, a Rider. Maybe you've heard of me, if you know any Japanese history?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I read about you in a textbook. You're a Meiji Restoration hero!  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Haha... I'm honored. I never imagined I would end up in the history books someday!  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Yaaay. This calls for sekihan for dinner.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Umm... You're from Tosa and were active during the Bakumatsu era...  
   
**Oryou:**   
You are very knowledgeable.  
Maybe even more than Oryou.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
A Meiji Restoration hero, huh...  
  
   
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
I see. So your name is Fujimaru,  
and you're the Master of Chaldea.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You know about Chaldea?  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Nope. Not at all. Far as I can tell,  
you look to be a visitor from elsewhere.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's me. Master extraordinaire.  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
I know some of them are backups,  
but to command that many Servants...  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Truly impressive.  
  
   
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
...As for that Servant who seems quite concerned about your well-being...  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
...maybe it's time she introduced herself as well?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
I'm...a Servant...I think.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
...Was I Okita?  
Do you know me, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You do look like Okita, but...  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
So...you're THE Okita?  
Or maybe, a different aspect of her?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
No, I shouldn't be surprised.  
Anything could happen here.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Have you ever heard of Alters?  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Short for “alternative,” right? When a different side of a Heroic Spirit manifests, if I'm not mistaken.  
  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Okita. Is that my name?  
If you say it is, Master, then it must be.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
So this is an Alter...  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Still, I didn't think this was a particularly common occurrence.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Tell me, do you happen to know any other Altered Heroic Spirits?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Uh...yeah, you could say I know...a few...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think another one just showed up recently.  
   
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
That IS a surprise.  
You really know that many, do you?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
You are not just any Master, it would seem.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Right, then.  
Why don't I explain what is happening here.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Oryou, would you make some tea for our guests?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
...Oryou?  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
...Huh!? Tea? Right, tea.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Certainly, Boss. Oryou'll even throw in some saliva, too. Oryou's saliva can cure anything, after all.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...A Holy Grail War?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...So there's a Holy Grail War here too, huh.  
   
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
That's right. I'm glad I won't have to waste any time explaining Holy Grail Wars, then.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
...As you know, a typical Holy Grail War is a battle between seven Servants for the Grail itself.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
We are in a sort of variation of that.  
There are no Masters here, just a...LOT of Servants.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Many of these Servants are forced to fight tooth and nail just to secure one of the seven classes for themselves.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait. Servants are fighting each other for classes?  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Sort of. Defective Servants are killing each other in an attempt to secure a proper class.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Think of it as a sort of...selections stage preceding the actual battle itself.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...So it's a Holy Grail War with no Masters?  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
There have been rare cases of Rogue Servants,  
yes, but nothing like this.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Here, every Servant is acting on their own,  
without a single Master among them.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
In fact, you're the very first Master I've ever seen.  
  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Then, does that mean I'm one of those Servants?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
I'm afraid I can't speak to that...  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
All I know is that you're the only Servant I've seen here with a Master.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
What are you doing here with [♂ him /♀ her], anyway?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...All I know is...when I came to, Master was there.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I feel like I have to stay with [♂ him /♀ her], no matter what.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Hey Ryouma, maybe she imprinted on [♂ him /♀ her]?  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
You know, like when a baby bird thinks the first creature it sees is its mother?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Come now.  
Just because YOU did that doesn't mean&ndash;  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...And that's my cue!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai! Are you all right!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Da Vinci!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash!  
   
  
   
**Oryou:**   
What the hell? That scared Oryou.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Hey, what kind of monster are you?  
A whatmon?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
It looks like some of Master Fujimaru's friends have joined us. I'm impressed they managed to slip through the Imperial Capital's quarantine...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Quarantine... Exactly!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
We're still figuring out how it happened,  
but what we do know...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...is that Fujimaru got trapped there during a Rayshift.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Normally, we don't have any issue tracking [♂ him /♀ her],  
but for some reason, it was tricky this time.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But being the unparalleled genius that I am, I was able to brute-force my way to reestablishing comms!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm just glad you're all right, Senpa&ndash;Wait,  
what happened to your stomach!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm okay. It looks worse than it is.  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I see...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I got...shot. Just a little though.  
   
**Mash:**   
Are you sure you're all right!?  
  
   
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Relax. A little spit and [♂ he'll /♀ she'll] be good as new.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Spit...!?  
Um, Senpai, can I ask who you are with?  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Oryou's Oryou. Just who the hell are you?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Yes, yes, just wait your turn, Oryou...  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Let's try that again. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I'm Sakamoto Ryouma, a Rider.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
I take it you're Master Fujimaru's friends?  
You're affiliated with this Chaldea place [♂ he /♀ she] spoke of?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So you're the ones who helped Fujimaru out.  
Thanks for that.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You seem like the sort of Servant with a good head on his shoulders.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
How about it, Fujimaru?  
Has that been your experience so far?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He and Oryou did save me...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I definitely don't think he's a bad person.  
   
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Got it. If that's what you think,  
I'm willing to give them a chance.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But I do want to make sure of one thing first.  
What are you hoping to get out of all this, Rider?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
I suppose I should've seen that question coming.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
...Hmm. There's no sense lying about this,  
so I'll just be direct.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
I want to either retrieve or destroy the Holy Grail. I'd even be happy to let Master Fujimaru have it if [♂ he /♀ she] wants.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm, and why is that? I don't see how an arrangement like that could possibly benefit you.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
You've got me there... Someone else said something real similar to me a long time ago.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
All right, let me put it this way. The Holy Grail is the cause of a lot of suffering for the people here.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
I want to help them and put a stop to it. That's all.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You want to help them? That's it? You're really just going to say it flat out like that, in that lovely baritone voice of yours?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Heh... Hahahahaha!  
You really got me good! Talk about an emergency!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You don't have to laugh that much.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Come on Da Vinci, be nice.  
   
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh come on, you have to admit it's funny. I mean,  
this guy couldn't be more suspicious if he tried!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Still... Hmm, I suppose I will take you at your word. I do know Sakamoto Ryouma to be a Heroic Spirit who is certainly worthy of trust.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? Why is that, Acting Director Da Vinci?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, I took a gander at his file, and everything he's saying right now lines up with how he was in life.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
He's a very greedy person. He always sought wider recognition more than individual gratitude.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
People like that might talk a good game, but they don't lie. Don't you agree, Fujimaru?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, you may be right.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I do think he's a good person.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
I, uh, I see...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
All right then, Rider, I'm counting on you to take good care of Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
As for us, we're Chaldea, the Security Organization dedicated to the Preservation of Humanity.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You can think of us as Fujimaru's backup team,  
[♂ his /♀ her] operational support, if you like.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I am Leonardo da Vinci.  
Most people just call me Da Vinci, though!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And I'm Mash...Mash Kyrielight.  
I'm one of Senpai's Servants.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Hm.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So, you're...Sakamoto Ryouma.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Even though you're a master of the Hokushin Ittouryu, your greatest achievement did not involve drawing your sword...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...but in helping to negotiate the Satchou Alliance in an effort to restore imperial rule to Japan. You were a hero of the Meiji Restoration.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Wow, Ryouma. Oryou didn't know you were so famous.  
Yaaay. Now we can have sekihan tomorrow too.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Mmm. How kind of you.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Let's see, Da Vinci, was it?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
It seems you've already gotten a good look at what's going on here in Tokyo, yes?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Righto. Honestly, this sorta stuff happens all the time, so it's not really anything new for us. But let me fill you in just in case.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That place you're in now? Tokyo is the only thing that exists there. Basically a self-contained island.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Only Tokyo?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What do you mean?  
   
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It's shut in by a series of invisible walls, which makes it impossible to get in or out using conventional means.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It's a bit like a Singularity in that it's quite separate from regular human history.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then, nobody can escape from here?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Does that mean you can't intervene from the outside?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
A Singularity, huh... Yeah, that sounds about right.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
...You're spot-on.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Nobody, whether human or Servant, is able to set one foot outside the Imperial Capital's limits.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
It's completely isolated, even from history itself.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Then, how is Senpai supposed to get back?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, don't you worry about that, Mash.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The fact that we're able to communicate like this means there should also be a way to Rayshift [♂ him /♀ her] out of there.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Though we'll need a lot more information and a much more stable connection to improve our odds of success.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Fortunately, since I'm such an amazing genius,  
I've already mapped out the Singularity's structure.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Near as I can tell, it's erecting a Bounded Field around several different points to maintain the whole area's integrity.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I've narrowed down a few points that seem like likely candidates, but I can't say anything for sure without seeing them for myself...  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Not to worry. What you've said has been a big help, believe it or not.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
I already planned to investigate this place myself anyway.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Sorry, the simulation we're using to observe you there just went kinda haywire.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It looks like somebody's jamming our signal. Whoever it is, they must have some kinda jerkwad engineer working for them.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It's going to take us a while to sort all this out,  
and we'll have to disconnect while we do it.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm afraid this is all we can do for now.  
Let me send you the points to investigate before we go.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...All right, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
We'll keep an eye on things from here as best we can,  
but make sure you watch your own back too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, please be careful, Senpai!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
B-by the way, is that Okita there with you?  
She seems...kind of different...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I was too busy with my analysis to pay much attention, but now that you mention it, she DOES have a different air about her, doesn't she.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's not just the air.  
Her whole color palette is&ndash;  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Who was that...?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh, that was Mash?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That was my really helpful kouhai.  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Hm.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...I see.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
What's wrong? You hungry or something?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
...You're more than a little clueless about some things, aren't you, Oryou.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Anyway, we don't have any time to waste.  
I need to find out what the other Servants are up to.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Since your wound still needs time to heal, can I ask you to stay here and watch the place while I'm gone?  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
He means weaklings should stay put.  
Sit... Stay! Good small fry.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Understood.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Small fry...?  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...I'll keep Master safe.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Yes, please do. That will be a big help.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Say, I have an idea. If you have the time,  
maybe you'd like to help me a bit with my work?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Things have kind of piled up while I've been away from the office, you see.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
I'll be happy to pay you, of course, and you wouldn't have to go far out of your way. Just handle whatever you're comfortable with. That should be fine.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Since this area is a good ways away from the three Servants' territories, it should be pretty safe.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Territories?  
   
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Ah, yes. It's a sort of additional rule specific to this Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
As long as a Servant with an official class is inside their own territory...  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
...they receive special support from the Holy Grail.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...I don't have any support.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
That's why I specified they have to have an official class.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Only once a Servant has won a battle for a class,  
and then been registered as that class...  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
...will the Holy Grail begin to support them.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
You can't compete with other Servants over territory until you've done that much.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Reminds me of that ink shooter that Archer and Hokusai play...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It reminds me of Risk or something.  
   
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Essentially. All of the contestants are competing for territory.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Incidentally, since I'm a Rider, I have some leeway to ignore the other Servants' territories and go where I please.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Luckily for me, that's a handy thing to be able to do when you're conducting an investigation.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see.  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
I'm glad you catch on so quickly. I've never been part of a Holy Grail War quite like this either.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
There are still a lot of things I'm unsure about, and the only way to find out more is to do the legwork.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Does that go for the Mini Nobus too?  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
You mean those strange creatures the Archer was commanding? It seems so, yes.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
The effect seems to differ depending on the Heroic Spirit and class, so in the end, it still comes down to investigating matters directly.  
  
   
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
All right then, I'm going out for a while.  
Thanks for keeping an eye on my office in the meantime.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Oryou will bring you back a frog.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Be careful out there.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Um, I'm not really fond of frogs...  
   
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
See you soon.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Hey, Ryouma.  
Are you sure about them?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
You mean the Master? I think we'll be fine.  
[♂ He /♀ She] seems like a perfectly nice person.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
I do consider myself a decent judge of character, you know. Plus, it seems like [♂ his /♀ her] friends are rather capable as well.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
No, Oryou meant to ask if those weaklings will be okay watching your office alone.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
...I'm shocked.  
I never thought you would ever worry about a human.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Have you taken a liking to [♂ him /♀ her]?  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Yes. [♂ He /♀ She] looks yummy.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Ah, I see...  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Don't worry, they'll be fine.  
If I'm right, then that Servant is...  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
What? Does your stomach hurt?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
No, no, I'm fine.  
  
   
**A：Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Anyway, this certainly isn't the first time, but...  
  
   
**A：Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
...it looks like this Holy Grail War is going to be quite a pain in the neck.  
  
   
## Section 3: Man-Slayer  
   
**Rogue Servant:**   
...!?  
  
   
**G：Man in Black Coat:**   
Hmph. I don't know if you were some big,  
tough Saber in your day, but you're nothing to me.  
  
   
**G：Man in Black Coat:**   
You got some nerve, thinking you could take me on as weak as you are.  
  
   
**Rogue Servant:**   
...!  
  
   
**G：Man in Black Coat:**   
Oho... So you're trying to use the closest thing you have to a Noble Phantasm.  
  
   
**G：Man in Black Coat:**   
Too bad.  
  
   
**Rogue Servant:**   
...!  
  
   
**G：Man in Black Coat:**   
...I've already learned your technique.  
  
   
**Radio Announcement:**   
This just in. Early this morning,  
the Army's 4th Magecraft Unit announced...  
  
   
**Radio Announcement:**   
...that a Holy Grail War has begun in the Imperial Capital, Tokyo.  
  
   
**Radio Announcement:**   
We repeat: a Holy Grail War has begun in Tokyo.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh, it's on the news?  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Oh, normally it isn't?  
...I see.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you like listening to the radio?  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Yes.  
...It's also good for learning words.  
  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...For some reason, there are many things I don't know.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Servants should have memories of their lives,  
but I do not.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Okita Souji... Is that who I am?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
And why am I missing the knowledge of this era that the Grail should have given me when I materialized?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I couldn't even speak until a little while ago...  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...What am I?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Alter...  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I don't even know if I'm a Saber.  
I think I'm too weak for that.

**Fujimaru 2:**   
At least you learned quickly, right?  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Hm?  
Yes, I guess that's true.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Maybe...I'm actually smart?  
  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
By the way, Master, are you sure you're okay making a contract with a strange Servant like me?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I'm not even sure if we sealed our contract properly...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm sure I can count on you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm glad I met you.  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...I see. I'm glad I met you, too.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Hold it.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Someone's here.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe it's a customer?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe it's Sakamoto?  
   
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
...Pardon me.  
Is this the Sakamoto residence?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Uh, yes, that's right.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...I'm afraid Sakamoto isn't here right now.  
   
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
I see. Just what I wanted to hear.  
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
...I am going to kill you now.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
What do you think you're doing?  
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
What's this? Who are you?  
Why are you getting in my way?  
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
Ah, the sword...  
I take it you are a Saber?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
An enemy Servant!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Alter! Are you okay!?  
   
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
What nonsense.  
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
Servants killing each other is the point of a Holy Grail War. Of course I'd start by getting rid of the weaker ones.  
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
And you ARE weak, aren't you, Saber?  
I could tell the moment we crossed blades.  
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
Honestly, I can hardly believe you're a Saber with such pitiful skills.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
Haha!  
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
So THIS is the Saber? One of the three strongest classes? That's hysterical!  
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
Talk about a lucky break,  
getting you as my first opponent.  
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
NOW DIE!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Hmm. I should have known.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Other Servants are much harder to fight than those weaker enemies.  
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
What are you?  
Are you sure you're a Saber?  
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
Your swordplay is a bad joke. Your form is BEYOND amateurish. Are you carrying that enormous blade around just for show?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...I'm sorry, Master, I can't beat him.  
I guess I really am weak.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's get out of here!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You don't have to win. We just have to survive.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Okay. Let's run for it.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Hold on tight. Don't let go.  
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
Fools! Do you really think I'd let you escape!?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...I'm sorry I'm such a useless Servant, Master.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
You must be very disappointed in me.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not at all, Alter.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can we maybe talk about this later?  
   
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
...Don't bother running away.  
I can tell exactly what you're going to do.  
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
It is too little, too late, but I suppose I can at least commend your quick getaway attempt.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Did you hear that, Master?  
He said my getaway attempt was quick.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Maybe I'm not useless after all!  
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
...Are you mocking me?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Am I, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Never mind that! Let's just run for it!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I...don't think that's what's going on here.  
   
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
Nobody mocks me and gets away with it!  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
You sure about that, little Assassin?  
  
   
**Man in Black Coat:**   
...You!?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Are you all right, Fujimaru?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Well if it isn't Izo. As I live and breathe!  
Haven't seen you around here in a dog's age.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sakamoto!  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Oh, sorry, guess that's the country in me slipping out. Anyway! Sorry I was gone so long!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You sound...different.  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Oh, sorry. I usually try to keep the country under control, but sometimes it just slips out.  
  
   
  
   
**D：Izo:**   
...Ryooouma!  
You've got a lot of nerve showing your face here, traitor!  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Calm down, little Assassin.  
All that anger just makes you seem even smaller.  
  
   
**D：Izo:**   
Shut it, ya bitch!  
  
   
**D：Izo:**   
Ryouma! First you sell us out,  
then you show up like nothing happened!?  
  
   
**D：Izo:**   
And now you're claiming to be a hero of the Meiji Restoration!? Is there no end to your mockery!?  
  
   
**D：Izo:**   
You got me beheaded, you piece of shit!  
  
   
**D：Izo:**   
I'll NEVER forgive you!  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
I'm sorry.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
I really do feel bad about that.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
But we also really don't have time for this right now. There's a seriously dangerous Servant right behind us!  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
You're not getting away from me, Rider.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
If you thought you could enter my territory and leave alive, you were sorely mistaken.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okita!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Huh? She seems different somehow...  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Okita?  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Hm? An Assassin, and...  
What!?  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Is that...me?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...You're my&ndash;  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Now! Oryou, jump!  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Take these two and Izo with you!  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
You mean Oryou's gotta take the little Assassin too? Ughhh...  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Fine, since you asked. But just today.  
  
   
**D：Izo:**   
This isn't over, Ryouma!  
Hey! Let go of me, you brute!  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
D-don't call me a brute. Oryou's not a brute; you're a brute. Hey, are you sure we can't just leave this annoying bug behind?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
No, sorry. Try not to let him provoke you for a bit... Anyway, Okita, we'll be saying bye for now.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
You're not going any&ndash;Urk...!?  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
I didn't even realize I'd strayed out of my territory...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
I guess going after Riders on foot isn't the best idea...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
...Still, that Servant...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
She looked just like me...  
  
   
## Section 4: Battle Front  
   
**D：Izo:**   
...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um... Do you guys know each other or something?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Is it just me, or is it kind of cold in here?  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Why did we bring this dumb little bug with us?  
He's ugly. We should have left him behind.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Well, Izo and I go way back.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Okada Izo of Tosa was pretty famous in Kyoto back when the Tokugawa shogunate was on its last legs.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
So, you know each other?  
  
   
**D：Izo:**   
KNOW each other!?  
This coward betrayed us!  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...And I said I was sorry about that.  
  
   
**D：Izo:**   
Sorry!? You think just saying sorry makes up for what you did!?  
  
   
**D：Izo:**   
How about I cut you to ribbons right here,  
and then we'll see how sorry you are?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...I see. I didn't realize you hated me that much.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...All right. If that's what it takes to make you feel better, go ahead.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Kill me.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Huh? No. That doesn't work for Oryou.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
It's all right, Oryou. Please, stay out of this.  
  
   
**D：Izo:**   
I'm serious about this, Ryouma!  
  
   
**D：Izo:**   
I'm a man of my word! If I say I'll do something, I will damn well do it!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is this really happening!?  
   
  
   
**Izo:**   
Wha...!?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Wh-why didn't you dodge, Ryouma!?  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Ryouma! That's a serious wound!  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...What, this? It's nothing.  
If it helps Izo feel better, I can deal with it.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Besides, if he'd really meant to kill me,  
I'd be dead.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Isn't that right?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Wha... I-I knew you were a coward, but I didn't think you were an idiot, too! I swear, as long as we've known each other...!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Dammit! Just go ahead and die for all I care!  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Haha... Well, that should help keep the peace around here, right?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Oh, would someone mind grabbing those bandages for me?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Phew. Thanks, Oryou.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Oh, and I'm good on saliva, thanks.  
Besides, it's...pretty sticky.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Shut up. If you die, Oryou dies too, you know.  
Be careful.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Hmph.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
This doesn't mean I've forgiven you!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
I, uh... I just don't feel like killing you now, that's all!  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
I know. Thanks, Izo.  
Holding back for now is more than enough.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Why you... Do you EVER shut up...!?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Now, getting back to our previous discussion...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
I've managed a bit of investigating. Between that and the data Chaldea gave us, I think I've more or less sorted out how things work here.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
There are anchors made from fragments of the Holy Grail located at several points around the city...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...and each of them commands its own Servant.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Every Servant with an official class has their territory set around their anchor.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
The rules of this Holy Grail War are simple: fight the other Servants, gain their territories, and become the sole victor.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Exactly!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Damn, I wanted to be the one to explain all that.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Da Vinci!  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's right! Geniuses are the best at dramatic entrances! Even if that wasn't quite what I was aiming for this time.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash!  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank goodness you're all right, Senpai!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Thanks to Da Vinci's analysis,  
we've figured out a way to bring you back.  
  
   
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...So!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Since the anchors holding that place together are made from Holy Grail fragments...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...all you have to do is destroy them, and that world's foundations should come crumbling down, taking the Singularity with them.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Even better, once that's done, the signals jamming our observations should disappear too...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...which will make Rayshifting Fujimaru back to Chaldea pretty simple.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Still... We have a goal, but actually making it happen is a bit more difficult.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And then there's the whole twisting a Holy Grail War into some sort of Servant war game thing...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Why would anyone go to the trouble of setting up this Singularity to run on a system that is such a complete pain in the ass?  
  
   
**B：Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
We'll keep an eye on that as we investigate.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
For now, Fujimaru, I'd like you to focus mainly on destroying the anchors.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Aw crap, are we out of time already?  
Okay, one last quick thing.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You know the Servants' territories?  
Well, they look like they're linked to the anchors too.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The more you whittle down enemy Servants' territories the less assistance they'll get from the Grail.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
All right, looks like we're out of time, so, later!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, Senpai, about the tan Okita next to&ndash;  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...She seems a little too friendly with you.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You think?  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Yes.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash and I have been through a lot together.  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...I see. A lot, huh.  
  
   
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
At any rate, now we know what our goal is.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
We need to whittle down each Servant's territory and sever their connection to the Grail. Yeah, that's a lot more clear-cut.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Which means this is where we get serious.  
If we all work together, I'm sure we can pull it off.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Got it! ...Uh, by the way...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Er... What about you, Assassin? What are you going to do?  
   
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
You will help us, right, Izo?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Are ya insane!?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Why would I ever help YOU lot!?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
I'm ONE of the Servants in this Holy Grail War, you know!  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
I don't expect you to help for nothing, Izo.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Sure, you're a genius with the sword.  
But even you can't take them all on alone, can you?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Don't bother buttering me up!  
All you ever do is trick me into going along with you!  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Izo. You saw that enemy Saber for yourself, remember?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
She's tough. Really tough.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...You mean the one in the haori?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
I'd recognize that detestable blue haori anywhere... Ryouma, does that mean&ndash;  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
That's right. She's part of the strongest group of master swordsmen of the late Tokugawa shogunate...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...the group you and I have a long history with...  
  
   
**Rogue Servant:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Hey, you...  
  
   
**Rogue Servant:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Are you with Satsuma, or Choushu?  
  
   
**Rogue Servant:**   
...!?!?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Well, I guess it doesn't matter.  
Get in my way...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...and I'll cut you down where you stand!  
  
   
**Rogue Servant:**   
...!?!?!?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Not yet... I'm not done yet...!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Cut them up...!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Advance...!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
CUT THEM UP...!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
ADVANCE...!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
This is...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...the Shinsengumi!!!  
  
   
## Section 5: Competence  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...Hmm. The Rider and the Assassin, eh.  
  
   
**Scout Mini Nobu:**   
Nobbu!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Hmph. Well, it doesn't matter how many weaklings band together. They have no chance against me.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
In the meantime, continue gathering all the information you can.  
  
   
**Scout Mini Nobu:**   
Nobu!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Lady Nobunaga...  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...What is it?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
There is a messenger here, on the Caster's behalf.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Oh? The Caster, eh... I can't imagine they're serious about wanting to team up...  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Well, no matter.  
Go and hear what it is they have to say, Nobukatsu.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu:**   
Yes, Lady Nobunaga!  
Consider it done, Sister.  
  
   
**Rogue Servant:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!!!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Outta my way, moron!  
  
   
**Rogue Servant:**   
!?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Hmph... Weakling.  
Come on, the path's clear now.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're not much for diplomacy, are you...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you have to be so...you know...  
   
  
   
**Izo:**   
What? Ya got a problem with how I deal with things?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
If I hadn't cut that thing down,  
you'd be breathing through your neck right now.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Or would you have preferred to die so we could spare its feelings?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I-I guess you're right...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can't argue with that...  
   
  
   
**Izo:**   
Hmph. Well, your Servant IS quite weak.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
This would have been a much longer fight if I hadn't been here.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...That may be true, but it's still mean of you to say. Anyway, are you sure about this, Master?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
This Servant tried to kill Master.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
It's okay. Izo at least takes his job seriously.  
I know he'll do great, just like he did for Mr. Katsu.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
It's not JUST my job I take seriously!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Relax. I'm a man of my word.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Unlike that lying Ryouma.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How do you know Sakamoto, anyway?  
   
**Izo:**   
...We grew up in the same town.  
We used to play and go fishing together all the time.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're nicer than I thought.  
   
**Izo:**   
Huh? Are you as thickheaded as he is?  
I'm only helping you out for the time being!  
  
   
  
   
**Izo:**   
Anyway, once this is over,  
I'm just going to kill you all at once.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...This is it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So this is the Lancer's hideout...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How did you know where it was?  
   
  
   
**Izo:**   
I'm an Assassin.  
This is kind of my thing, kid.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Once I set my sights on someone,  
they don't get away.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I see. So that's how you found us.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Quiet.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Something's not right...  
I can't sense the Lancer's presence anymore.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you sure?  
   
**Izo:**   
Lancer was here just a moment ago,  
I'm sure of it...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Did you maybe make a mistake?  
   
**Izo:**   
I'm divine punishment incarnate!  
I don't MAKE mistakes!  
  
   
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Aha. That explains it.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
It looks like someone got here before us.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Come on. They're inside.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...Welcome, friend.  
Or, at least, welcome, visitor from the Far East.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Then again, I only just got here myself,  
so maybe greetings aren't necessary.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Did you kill the Lancer?  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Kakaka, easy there!  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
This Holy Grail War has been rather dull,  
what with so few worthwhile opponents to fight.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I was hoping these official Servants would be more of a challenge in their own territory, but as you can see, I was sadly mistaken.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I was told that Holy Grail Wars were a fearsome clash between heroes old and new.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
So naturally, I was curious to pit my own skills against these great heroes.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
However, it seems that my reputation for killing in a single strike still rings true.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
What an incredible letdown it was when the battle really was over with a single strike.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You killed the Lancer here with one hit!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Izo, this Lancer's  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Shut it.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Hmph, I bet you're one of those dilettantes who only practices martial arts in the safety of their dojo. Awfully smut for a glorified athlete.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
I hate to bring you down while you are clearly riding high on your victories over so many weaklings...  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...but I'm afraid now that I've found you,  
your luck's run out.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Prepare to be cut down where you stand!  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Good, good. That's the sort of absurd boasting I had been hoping for. Now I need not hold back.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
So, which of you would like to face me first?  
Or I can also take you all on at once if you prefer.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Huh? These two are only here to watch.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
I can handle a little spear-wielder like you without breaking a sweat.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Now DIE!  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Kaka, that's more like it!  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I look forward to seeing what challenge,  
if any, your swordsmanship offers.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...This is awful.  
All these beautiful flowers, snuffed out in their prime.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Even for a Berserker, this is horrific.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
This park is supposed to be for everyone.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
It looks like he just went around killing anyone who happened to be close by. Even Oryou wouldn't make this much of a mess.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
I don't know about that. You can get awfully messy. Anyway...how do we find the Berserker in question...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Hey, you.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Ah. Ryouma, behind you.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Hey, you... Are you with Satsuma, or Choushu?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Oh, well then... It seems the Berserker found us.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Huh? Wait a moment... I know there's something wildly different about you, but aren't you...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Well, well. It looks like Izo isn't the only blast from my past here.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Answer me... Are you with Satsuma, or Choushu?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
If you refuse to answer...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...that will itself be answer enough...!  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
I never thought I'd run into the Demon Vice Commander of the Shinsengumi having a drink among the cherry blossoms here of all places.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Looks like you won't need to hold back, Oryou!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
So you are my enemies. Just as I thought.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...This area belongs to the Shinsengumi.  
Nobody sets foot here and leaves alive!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...I-impossible!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
H-how can I be losing!?  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...How boring.  
You really are all bark and no bite.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I can see where this is going.  
The best you can hope for is to die honorably now.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Go ahead, come at me one more time.  
I can at least give you a quick death.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...This can't be happening!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
My...my sword is invincible!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...W-wait, of course! The territory!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
You changed places with that Lancer you defeated, didn't you!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
You can't fool me! I know how you Three Knight Classes get way more support from the Holy Grail than the rest of us!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Y-you're a coward, using cheap tricks like that!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Izo, it's...really not that in this case.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This particular Lancer is just, well...  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...He's not using anything.  
...He's just strong, plain and simple.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...What a shame.  
If only you didn't have such a short temper.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
You have enough natural talent that, with training,  
you could have really been something.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
C-COULD have been!?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
My sword has never failed me!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Nobody could beat me! I could make any other style my own just be seeing it in action once!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
I...I am a genius with the sword!  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I know. You clearly have a gift for observation.  
You even surpass me in raw talent.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Wha...!?  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
But that's all you have. A true martial artist must be skilled in many disciplines. Training only in one discipline is no path to supremacy.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
You should have disposed with such foolish notions while you were still young. Unfortunately, it seems fate was not kind to you.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I can tell you must have died while you were still young and foolish. What a waste.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
What did you say...?  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Enough talk now.  
I have sworn to take no more than one life per battle.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
This is as far as you go, Assassin,  
but I'm willing to let the [♂ boy /♀ girl] live for now.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
After all, if I were to kill everyone every time, I'd soon run out of prey with which to make my living.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't think so.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Stand back, Izo. Let's do this, Alter!  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Got it.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Are you mad!? How many times have I told you!?  
Even I was no match for him!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
There's no way such a pathetically weak Servant as her could last more than a second!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...I see. So you will be my true opponent.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Very well then, yours will be the life I take in this battle.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Master, this Servant is very strong.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
But I won't let him kill you. I promise.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm counting on you, Alter!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I know you won't.  
   
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Trust born from loyalty, hmm? Very well then.  
It's been some time since I killed a human!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Guh!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Alter!  
   
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Hahahaha! This was quite an exciting match!  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
You were doomed from the start, but still you blocked my attacks no fewer than three times!  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Pathetic swordsmanship indeed. You seem to lack confidence in your skills...but that is obviously not because you had it once and then lost it.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
No, I believe there is nothing wrong with you as you are now.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...!  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
That is why your last push was so powerful.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...The gods can be quite cruel. You have lost your destiny, and so remain ignorant. Yet from that ignorance came a flawless, techniqueless decisive blow.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Your conviction was a sight to behold.  
You must care about that [♂ boy /♀ girl] a great deal.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Lancer.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...Still, I may not have lost if I hadn't relaxed my guard.  
I suppose I'm in no position to lecture.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
You there, subservient Assassin. I would say that my spear and your sword were a hairsbreadth apart.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
What...?  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
But even a hairsbreadth can be a world of distance.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Why are you helping me?  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
You remind me of myself. I went around causing no end of trouble when I was young, too.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Take it from this old man. If you want to progress, it's not too late to&ndash;Ah, perhaps it is too late, since Servants don't grow or change?  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Well, no matter. Even if what I tell you helps only in this conflict, it will still be of significance.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Take this as a chance to work on your swordplay.  
Rebuild your skills from the ground up.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Stop wasting time telling your opponents how much better than them you are. Instead simply demonstrate your superior strength and skill.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
The task is the same, of course. But changing your approach will change how you feel about it.  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Besides...  
It's fun to surpass one's own limits.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...You actually beat him.  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Yes... His skill with a spear was incredible.  
I'm still not quite sure how I did it.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Alter... You seem a lot stronger now.  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Am I? It's hard for me to tell.  
  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Now that I think of it, I feel like I'm moving better after seeing that Saber fight.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Hey. This is as far as we go together.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Izo.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...But  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Wait. I hate to say it...  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...but your battle with that Lancer helped to weaken him.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Shut up. We're not friends, or allies,  
or even friendly acquaintances.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
I had a job to do, and now it's done. We meet next as enemies, and I won't show you any mercy.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...  
  
   
## Section 6: Agreement  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
...So, the Lancer's territory is gone.  
That's a surprise.  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
Do we know who took them out?  
  
   
**Officer:**   
I'm afraid we can't say for certain, since it's enemy territory, but it seems the Assassin was involved.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
Our last report said the Assassin suffered an injury before disappearing, and his whereabouts are currently unknown.  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
Assassin... He must have ambushed the Lancer.  
A fitting tactic for an insignificant coward.  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
Forget about him.  
An injured Assassin won't last long here.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
Yes, sir!  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
All right, I think it's time I made my own move.  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
...Rest assured, Lady Nobunaga, I've arranged things to be certain you have a grand old time.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...We're back.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're home.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So...tired...  
   
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Hey there. Thanks for all the hard work.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Looks like your job went off without a hitch.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
What happened to you? You look beat up.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Our job was pretty difficult.  
Not for Oryou, though.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
I know, I know. I'm sorry I wasn't any help.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
We ended up running into the Berserker, you see.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
It wasn't easy, but we made it back here at least.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Congrats on a job well done, Fujimaru. I'm glad to see everything's fine.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
We've also got confirmation that the Lancer's anchor is gone.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just the Lancer? What about the Berserker?  
   
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Sorry, he turned out to be kind of, uh, tough.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
By the end, I was so beat up I couldn't make it to the anchor.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
We'll go back there and get to it tomorrow.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
We spent the whole night at that park...  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Hmph. Oryou didn't even have time to catch any frogs, dammit.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks for taking care of that.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's fine. Don't worry about the frogs. Really.  
   
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
At any rate, the more anchors you get rid of,  
the easier it'll be for us.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Destroying that anchor seems to have stabilized our connection, so keep it up and get rid of the rest of them.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, so much for that stable connection...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, let me get right to the point!  
What is the nature of your relationship with that Oki&ndash;  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
She wasn't kidding.  
That connection wasn't stable at all.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
By the way, I don't see Izo around.  
Will he be back soon?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Actually...  
   
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...I see. So that's what happened with your group.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Still, I'm glad he's not dead.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Izo's a lot more sensitive than you might think.  
It's best if we give him some space for now.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
If you have energy to worry about that,  
spend it worrying about Oryou instead.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Yes, yes, yes... I'm always worried about you, Oryou.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Good. That's what Oryou likes to hear.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...You want him to worry?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...So you're the Caster's messenger, huh.  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Thank you for seeing me.  
These are Caster's terms for cooperation.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...Nobukatsu, read it.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu:**   
Yes, Sister!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Hey, I told you to call me “Lady Nobunaga” here.  
How many times have we been over this?  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu:**   
Oh, r-right!  
I'm so sorry, Sis&ndash;Uh, Lady Nobunaga!  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu:**   
Now, let's see what we've got...  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu:**   
“We agree to refrain from attacking each other until all other Servants have been defeated.”  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Hmph, I expected as much.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu:**   
It also says... Huh!?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
What is it?  
Does he want me to hand over my gun or something?  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu:**   
N-no, nothing like that...  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu:**   
He says he'll let us have the Holy Grail once all the other Servants have been defeated.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...What?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Does that mean Caster's forfeiting this war?  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Yes, ma'am... That's what I've been told.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu:**   
Sister... Something doesn't add up.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu:**   
Why's Caster even taking part in the Holy Grail War at all then?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
I told you, call me Lady Nobunaga.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...Hmm.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...Tell Caster that I understand and accept his terms.  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Yes, ma'am! I'll be on my way then!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...Hmph. It doesn't matter what he's thinking if I'm just going to kill him anyway.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu:**   
...That's a good point. Boy, Sister, you don't play around when it comes to evil!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...If you call me that again,  
it will be the last thing you ever say.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Okay, why don't we go over our next moves?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Now that the Lancer and Berserker are gone,  
that just leaves the Saber, Archer, and Caster.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
I have a good idea where the Saber and Archer are thanks to Chaldea's data and my own investigation.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
The Caster has built up and expanded his territory as well, though I still don't know where his base is.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
And since members of that class are especially good at holing up in their own strongholds...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...I don't think there's much we can do about him until he makes a move.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
So we're back to the Saber and Archer again.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Which do you two want to deal with?  
Of course, Oryou can take both if you're afraid.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...The Saber.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Alter...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okita's gonna be a tough opponent.  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I feel like I NEED to see that Saber again, Master.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I don't know why, but I can't shake the feeling.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Good point...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
If you really are another aspect of Okita,  
then you should see her again.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
But, be careful.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Okita Souji was said to be the strongest of all the Shinsengumi...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...the group of swordsmen so fearsome that they had all of Kyoto quaking during the Tokugawa's final days.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, I, uh...I know them.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I've met swordsmen as amazing as Okita before...  
   
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
I was always wary of the Shinsengumi whenever I was in Kyoto. Just a hint of their pale blue haori was enough to make me turn around and go the other way.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
So Oryou just has to murder the Archer then.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
That's a rather crude way to put it,  
but, yes, I suppose so.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
You two should be careful too.  
That Archer was frighteningly strong.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Her? That dumb Archer's bullets aren't enough to even scratch Oryou.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Just relax and let Oryou take care of her.  
This time, Oryou will even bring you back a frog.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's all look out for each other.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You really like frogs, don't you?  
   
  
   
**Oryou:**   
All right, let's do this thing.  
Wanna light a signal fire to mark the occasion?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
No, no. No need for that.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
All right, good luck, you two.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...And be warned, Okita really is strong.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's get going, Alter!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go pay Okita a visit.  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Yes, Master.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Let's go see this other me.  
  
   
## Section 7: Memory  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
At least we didn't have any trouble getting here.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...It's pretty quiet, huh.  
   
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
So, you've come...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Then let's get started.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
J-just like that!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You ARE Okita, aren't you?  
   
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
For an enemy, you're awfully familiar with me.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
But even if you do know who I am,  
this is a Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
It'd be absurd to think the Okita Souji you know and the one standing before you are the same.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...I want to ask you something.  
...Am I you?  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
That's hard to say.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
I certainly never had a sword quite that...huge.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
...But, as I said, this is a Holy Grail War.  
Maybe these sorts of things just happen.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
...  
That's strange...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
I'm not usually so chatty before a duel.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I get the same feeling.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...So let's just find out in battle.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Very well...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
...There is no right or wrong on the battlefield.  
There is only kill, or be killed.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Let's do this!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Rider, huh...  
I'm impressed you plowed through my army so easily.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Nothing easy about it.  
Those weird little things are surprisingly tough.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Is it your territory that lets you make them?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
...Lady Oda Nobunaga.  
The Demon King of the Sixth Heaven.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Facing you in person, I can see exactly why you dominated the Warring States period.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Hmph. Spare me your hollow flattery.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
What is it you want, Rider?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Depending on what it is,  
it may not be necessary for us to fight.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
If only that were the case.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
But I'm afraid what I want is your head,  
Lady Nobunaga. Figuratively speaking.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
My head?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
That's right. I've been investigating for a while, and everything I've found points to you being the key to this Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Hmm... Does this mean you're forfeiting the war too, Rider?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Are you giving up on your wish for the Holy Grail?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Well, as it turns out...the real Rider is long gone by now.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Oryou got rid of him.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...What?  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
I was never truly part of this Holy Grail War to begin with.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
...I'm only here because the world itself called to me.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
What?  
Then, you mean you're part of the Counter Force...?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Wahahahaha! This is great!  
I've made an enemy of the world itself!  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Anyway, that's where things stand.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Then I suppose we do have to fight.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Fine then. Once I defeat you, I'll be able to widen my sphere of influence even further.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
...Let's do this, Oryou!  
I'm going to use my Noble Phantasm!  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Don't worry. Oryou will snap a little twig like this in no time.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
So, you've chosen to go on the offensive right out of the gate.  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Orochi of the earth, sealed by the Amasakahoko...  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Oho. I knew it. That woman's your Noble Phantasm!  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Here I come, Demon King of the Sixth Heaven!  
  
   
**Sakamoto Ryouma:**   
Like a Dragon Soaring Through the Heavens...  
Amakakeru Ryu ga Gotoku!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Ha! A dragon, eh. Fascinating!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
But nothing can withstand my Three Line Formation!  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
A swordsman's blade must be swift and sharp!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Wha!?  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
...Too slow!  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Don't just step in with your feet!  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
You need to call upon all your own strength to face your opponent!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...What the?  
  
   
**F：???:**  
...There's nothing that can be done for this baby.  
She was probably born too prematurely.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Her skin's dirt brown,  
and she's barely even breathing.  
  
   
**G：???:**  
Please... Isn't there anything you can do?  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Forget her, Mitsu.  
She'll be lucky if she lasts even a day or two.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
At this point, all you can do is pray to the Buddha.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
You're swinging your sword from your wrist!  
The power should come from your waist!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Ghh!  
I...!  
  
   
**Mitsu:**   
...Please, Buddha! I beg of you. Please, save Soujirou.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**Mitsu:**   
Please... I beg you. I just know they'll grow up to do good as long as there's a chance...  
  
   
**Mitsu:**   
Please, save Soujirou.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Very well.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
At one point in that child's life...  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...she will form a pact with me, just once.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
When she does, I shall take her body from the world.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
...Are you an idiot or something!?  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Our swords may look different,  
but they're supposed to be used identically!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I know that!  
Just a little more, and I'll catch up!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Now I see. I'm a manifestation of the Counter Force that was brought here to repay this debt...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
...What!? How are you matching my speed with such a huge blade!?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...There. I caught up.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...And I remember now.  
I was right. I am you.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
...It's too soon to say that for sure.  
This duel isn't over yet.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You've been fighting for a while...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Endurance matches aren't your strong suit, Okita!  
   
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
I don't know what you're expecting, but if you're waiting for my magical energy to run out, don't bother.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
As long as I'm in my territory,  
that will never happen.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Not even the cursed disease that plagues my body can slow me down here.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
That...is the power my territory gives me.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
R-really...!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Then, that would make you Perfect Okita!  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Good. That is how it should be.  
I need to reclaim my identity!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Come on! I'll end this with my next strike!  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
All right... In that case,  
I'll fight you with everything I've got.  
  
   
**C：Okita Souji:**   
I am Okita Souji, Captain of the Shinsengumi's First Unit!  
  
   
**C：Okita Souji:**   
...Prepare to face the power of my secret technique!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Good grief.  
It's so strange, having another me around.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...You could have cut me down at any time.  
Why didn't you?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okita... Were you...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Were you trying to train Alter?  
   
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
I don't know what you're talking about.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
I'm just a man-slayer summoned by the Holy Grail.  
All I've done here is kill people left and right.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Nothing has changed. I cut down my enemies when I was alive, and I've done the same as a Servant. It was enough to make me forget why I was alive at all.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
...That's why I ended up pawning my debt off onto you.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
...Here. Take this with you.  
  
   
**C：Okita Alter:**   
This is...your Noble Phantasm...?  
  
   
**D：Okita Souji:**   
You have someone of your own to protect.  
  
   
**D：Okita Souji:**   
I failed to do that when I was still alive.  
Maybe I should have found a way, but I didn't.  
  
   
**C：Okita Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**D：Okita Souji:**   
You're the person I should have been.  
Now, it's time for me to say goodbye.  
  
   
**D：Okita Souji:**   
And, please...apologize to the Buddha for me.  
Tell him I'm sorry I ended up living only for myself.  
  
   
**D：Okita Souji:**   
...As for you.  
  
   
**D：Okita Souji:**   
I hope you can watch over this other me...at least until her time comes.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okita...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Alter... What was Okita talking about...?  
   
  
   
**C：Okita Alter:**   
...I remember now what it is I must do, Master.  
  
   
**C：Okita Alter:**   
Let's go back. The time is nearly at hand.  
  
   
**C：Okita Alter:**   
...It's time...for all this to end.  
  
   
## Section 8: Tenkai  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...I never thought I'd have to unleash my killer demon like this.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Your Noble Phantasm really is like a dragon soaring through the heavens...  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
But...that's also why it won't work on me.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
I can't believe it...  
I never imagined you would be this far gone.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Oda Nobunaga, Demon King of the Sixth Heaven...  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
...Oryou's sorry, Ryouma.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Oryou failed to keep you safe again...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Thank you, Oryou.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
You should have ascended to the heavens without worrying about me...  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...Have you finished your goodbyes? ...Then it looks like this is it, Hero of the Meiji Restoration.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
I'm going to destroy this world,  
and move on to the next.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Well, I don't know about that. Now that I've faced you directly, there's one thing I know for sure.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...As I suspected,  
you aren't yourself, Lady Nobunaga.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
What was that? What do you mean, Rider?  
  
   
**B：Ryouma:**   
...So now, my work here is done.  
From here on, someone else will have to...handle this...  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
I'm...not myself...?  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
Well done, Lady Nobunaga. I knew you would stand head and shoulders above the rest of this rabble of Heroic Spirits.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...Who are you?  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
Who am I? What a cruel thing to say.  
We just signed a treaty mere hours ago, remember?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
So you're the Caster. Now I see. With Rider dead,  
and the tide of this war turning in my favor...  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...you realized you were nearly out of time to ambush me, and hurried here before missing your opportunity.  
  
   
**Major General Amami:**   
Yes, I am a Caster. My True Name is Nankoubou Tenkai. It was my idea to build this Imperial Capital with the goal of keeping the Tokugawa dynasty safe.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
So you're Takechiyo's man...?  
Hmph, never heard of you.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Well, no matter.  
This saves me the trouble of hunting you down.  
  
   
**E：Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
Now, now, Lady Nobunaga, are you quite certain you don't remember me? Perhaps it would help if I took off these sunglasses.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...You!?  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
It's been a long time,  
my lord...Lady Oda Kazusa-no-Suke Nobunaga!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...What's the meaning of this?  
What are you even doing here!?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
What the...!?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...I can't move!  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
I already have you in the palm of my hand,  
Lady Nobunaga. Just like back at Honnoji!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...Ah, now I see. “Nankoubou Tenkai” was just a cover... And you rule this land...?  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
I knew you would catch on quickly, Lady Nobunaga.  
Indeed, this entire Imperial Capital is my territory.  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
Compared to the power I have amassed, the fights among you other Servants have just been little scuffles and brawls.  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
With each Holy Grail War,  
my territory collects new Spirit Origins...  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
This is my territory...  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
...The Imperial Capital of the gods!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...So this entire Imperial Capital is your territory, huh!?  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
I have waited a long time for this day.  
A very...very long time.  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
This is why I fled from that man, curried favor with the Tokugawa family, and have been biding my time for three centuries.  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
Now, at last, the true Lady Nobunaga will return!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
...Mitsuhideee! You bastard!  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
...Good. Take her away.  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Yes, sir!  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
Now, I have the Holy Grail, Lady Nobunaga's Spirit Origin, and the souls of the countless Heroic Spirits that have come to this land.  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
At last, my wish will be granted!  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
Hehehe...  
Hahahahahaha...!  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
Haaahahahahahahahahaha!  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're back.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I hope Sakamoto's okay.  
   
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu:**   
Ah, there you are, Fujimaru.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nobukatsu...!?  
   
  
   
**D：Oda Nobukatsu:**   
Come on, Sister, don't just pop up out of nowhere like that. You're scaring them.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu?:**  
Right, right, sorry. It's just that your body is so suffocating it's hard to get comfortable in here.  
  
   
**D：Oda Nobukatsu:**   
Well, what do you expect? We're two different people sharing the same Spirit Origin.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What are you... WHAT?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So, you're Nobukatsu and Nobbu?  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...What is this person, Master?  
  
   
**D：Oda Nobukatsu:**   
Long time no see! You're my sister's&ndash;  
  
   
**D：Oda Nobukatsu?:**  
Shut it, Nobukatsu. I'll do the talking.  
  
   
**D：Oda Nobukatsu?:**  
Oh, hey Okita, I didn't know you were here too.  
You look different though... Did you do something with your hair?  
  
   
**D：Oda Nobukatsu?:**  
...And your...skin?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nobbu? Is that you?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeeeah... Now it feels like GUDAGUDA...  
   
  
   
**D：Oda Nobukatsu?:**  
Well, you could say that,  
and you could also NOT say that.  
  
   
**D：Oda Nobukatsu?:**  
Look, just hear me out.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
Basically, Fujimaru...  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
...the Holy Grail summoned both me and you here at the same time.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
Well, more like it tied me down to it, really.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Tied you down to it?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Then, did that happen to Okita too?  
   
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
Yep. Normally, my Spirit Origin would've been made into the Holy Grail's Servant...  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
...and I would've been forced to do its bidding.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
But right before I was Servantized, I cut off a bit of my Spirit Origin to prevent that.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I didn't know that was a thing you could do.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yikes...  
   
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
Usually that sort of thing would be impossible.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
But after everything that transpired last time, Nobukatsu happened to be inscribed near my own Spirit Origin.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
I therefore rented out a bit of space in his Spirit Origin so I could manifest, too!  
  
   
**D：Oda Nobukatsu:**   
Usually, my Spirit Origin would be too weak to materialize at all...  
  
   
**D：Oda Nobukatsu:**   
...but I managed to pull it off after adding Sister's to my own.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
Still, this was an all-star team technique. It only worked because Nobukatsu and I are actual siblings.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
That said, this Spirit Origin is a little small for me, so it's kind of cramped in here. Can't do anything about that, though!  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
Anyway, I've been here biding my time seeing how things would play out ever since.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Are you kidding me? What kind of plot twist is that?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Long time no see, Senpai!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So, about that Okita who isn't like Oki&ndash;  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Sorry Mash, but this is urgent.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I am intrigued by the idea of housing two personalities in one Spirit Origin...but, yes, this is definitely more important.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I figured out the structure of that Singularity...or rather, why it was made in the first place.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Listen closely. That entire area is designed to collect Servants and produce pure Spirit Origins.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It's more like a magical circuit used for magecraft rituals than anything else.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It collects Servants?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Pure Spirit Origins?  
   
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
Now I see... It's a kodoku.  
  
   
**D：Oda Nobukatsu:**   
You know about it, Sister!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm, interesting. A kodoku is old Eastern magecraft that involves filling a pot with venomous snakes or insects and having them kill each other.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The mage then uses the fluids of the one creature that survived to cast a curse. What an excellent analogy.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
Basically, whoever's behind this is having Servants kill each other to get their hands on extremely pure Spirit Origins.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
That's why they needed a Holy Grail War with so many different Servants fighting each other.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And if that wasn't bad enough, from what we've observed, they've actually conducted a great many Holy Grail Wars there.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How many is a great many?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
For a long time now?  
   
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I can't say for sure, but I'm pretty sure that since the whole place was carved out of history...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...it's been host to Holy Grail War after Holy Grail War in order to keep collecting Spirit Origins.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Even if he IS taking advantage of the Holy Grail's power...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...the sheer planning, preparation, and time it would take to pull that off is insane.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
...Maybe, but I wouldn't put it past that kumquat.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Kumquat?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Isn't that your  
   
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Now that he's come this far, that Caster must be planning something pretty outrageous.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Now I see.  
So that's how we ended up out here.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Rider. I see you're all right.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Yup! Thanks to Lady Nobunaga's...kid brother?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What a relief...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where's Oryou?  
   
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Sorry. Oryou's still trying to live the whole thing down.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Oryou's actually my Noble Phantasm, you see. Once I was back up to snuff, she was able to maintain her form again.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Things don't usually go this well, but it looks like these are special circumstances.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
All that posturing you did when we said goodbye, and now look at us. This is so embarrassing. Oryou wishes she could just crawl into a water hole and die.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
Well, I can't exactly take advantage of my power in Nobukatsu's body anyway. Rider may be an especially weak Heroic Spirit, but he's better than nothing.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Haha, you've got me there.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Still, I'm hardly the only one. Compared to you, Lady Nobunaga, almost every Heroic Spirit here is third-rate at best.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
All the same, we still have to do something about the Caster's plot...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...or Fujimaru will never be able to get back home.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
Then there's only one thing to do.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
We grind that kumquat&ndash;I mean,  
Caster's plans into the dirt...  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
...and go back to Chaldea like the badasses we are.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
True. If we can stop him, then Master can go home.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then what are we waiting for!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We can do this if we all work together!  
   
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Hey. I'm coming too.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Izo? Is that you?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do I know you?  
   
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Izo... That's the outfit you wore during&ndash;  
  
   
**Izo:**   
I'm not doing this for you.  
I just don't like being anyone's pawn.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
I don't know who this Caster thinks he is, but nobody pulls my strings and gets away with it.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Come on, Ryouma, we don't need him, do we?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...We can absolutely use him.  
Izo is worth a hundred ordinary soldiers.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Hmph. So, do you know where this Caster is?  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
I've got a decent idea, but I don't have his exact whereabouts just yet. But you can fix that, can't you, Assassin?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
You bet. If there's a Servant in their territory, I can find them no problem.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Let's go, Master.  
I have a feeling this is why I'm here.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All right, let's go!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Alter...  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please take good care of Senpai, Alter!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Phew! I finally got to say it.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Mash, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes! I'm Mash Kyrielight!  
Uh... Your name is Alter, right?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Yes. Don't worry.  
I'll make sure to protect Master in your stead.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you so much!  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
All right then, it looks like all the players are in place.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
Talk about a motley crew.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
...But, at least things are finally getting interesting!  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
Don't you think, Fujimaru!?  
  
   
## Section 9: Rushing In  
   
**Alarm:**   
Intruder alert, intruder alert.  
  
   
**Alarm:**   
Enemy Servants detected.  
All Heroic Spirit Soldiers to your positions.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Out of my waaay!  
  
   
**Officer:**   
Our guns aren't working on them! Get the Heroic Spirit Soldiers! Overwhelm them with sheer numbers!  
  
   
**C：Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
How can there be this many of them!?  
It's too narrow here for so many! This is just like Okehazama!  
  
   
**C：Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
And what the hell are Heroic Spirit Soldiers, anyway!?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
They're artificial soldiers made from the Spirit Origins they've collected from Heroic Spirits.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
In Western terms, they're basically golems.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Of course, they can't hold a candle to Servants individually, but there are enough of them that they don't really need to.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
Grr, if I only had my own body, I could wipe these things out in an instant! Argh, this is so frustrating!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...We'll never get anywhere like this.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Looks like we'll have to handle this ourselves.  
The rest of you, go on ahead.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But, Sakamoto...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I know we've got to do something, but...  
   
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Don't worry about me. My wounds are all healed,  
and I've got Oryou AND Izo with me.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
How about it, Izo?  
Would you mind helping me out again?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
I never agreed to that!  
I'm only here to cut down that Caster!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
If you're just stalling for time,  
Ryouma, then do it yourself!  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
You're only good for taking out weaklings anyway. Trim their numbers before you die so Oryou can finish the job.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
What was that?  
You want to die first, snake-woman?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Ahahaha... Please, Izo?  
I could really use your help.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Ryouma...  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Tch, fine! Just go stand in a corner or something so you don't get in my way!  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
Let's go, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
Rider's Noble Phantasm is no joke. Having an ordinary human like you around'll just make it harder for him!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...All right!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Be careful!  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I'm sorry to leave this all up to you, Rider.  
...Thank you.  
  
   
**Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):**  
...Sorry to leave you like this, Rider.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...So they saw right through us, huh?  
I wonder if [♂ he /♀ she] noticed as well?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Hey, Oryou...  
You can barely move at all anymore, can you?  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Boo. Oryou can't believe the stupid weak Assassin saw through us. That is going to be a painful memory for the rest of Oryou's life.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Well, I have been pushing too hard for a while now... Guess it's about time for me to hang up my hat.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Ryouma!!!  
Don't you even start with that nonsense!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
What happened to the man who left us behind at Tosa!?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Haha... You really got me there.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Oryou still doesn't like you,  
but Oryou will forgive you this once.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Oryou is as kind as the Inland Sea.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
Go after the ones who ran off ahead!  
We can take care of these fools lat&ndash;  
  
   
**Officer:**   
Urk...!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Don't ignore me, fool.  
I've killed everyone who's ever tried.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Hraaaaaahhh!!!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...My name is Izo, the man-slayer of Tosa!  
ALL of you will die here!  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Well, what do you know.  
Guess Izo isn't worthless after all.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Of course not. After all...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...he's a genius swordsman!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is that...!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is that the Holy Grail?  
   
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
Hm? What are you lot doing here?  
I don't see Rider with you...  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
So you're the Caster.  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
...How odd. The Three Knight Class Servants are all down, and both Rider and Assassin will be soon.  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
Who are you...?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
Well, it doesn't matter. You're too late.  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
Take a look. This is the mass of Heroic Spirits I have accumulated over countless years.  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
This is Lady Nobunaga's Spirit Origin,  
and the Holy Grail, now both within my grasp!  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
At last...the true Lady Oda Kazusa-no-Suke Nobunaga will be reborn!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What does that mean?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Didn't you kill Nobunaga yourself?  
   
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
...Yes, of course I did.  
But I had no other choice.  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
He is the one who stopped Lady Nobunaga from truly being Lady Nobunaga...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You lost me...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...“He”?  
   
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
That's right! It was all that ape's fault!  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
Lady Nobunaga stopped being Lady Nobunaga right after he showed up!  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
Lady Nobunaga was MY light! MY salvation!  
She was everything to me!  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
I gave everything I had to her! Everything!  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
I even offered up my own mother to her without a second thought! And yet, she only smiled at him, never at me! Why!?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
Lady Nobunaga was mine and mine alone...  
I was the only one who ever understood her!  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
I had to be the only one who understood her!  
  
   
**Nankoubou Tenkai:**   
She had no right to go around sharing her dreams of world domination with anyone but me!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...This man...  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
...So I killed her.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...How could you do that?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...You're mad.  
   
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
I had no other choice, Lady Nobunaga.  
Everything I did, I did for you!  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
That ape could never hope to rule all of Japan!  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
That's why he failed so miserably! That's why he lost everything before dying a pitiful death!  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
But worry not!  
None but Lady Nobunaga can ever rule Japan!  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Yes! Lady Nobunaga! MY Lady Nobunaga!  
Now, hear me, Holy Grail! Hear me, Heroic Spirits!  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Bring forth Lady Nobunaga...MY Lady Nobunaga...!  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**   
Ugh... How dull.  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**   
You bore me, Kumquat...  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Who are you...?  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**   
Don't get me wrong, your scheme isn't terrible. It gets full marks for scale, and I actually like the whole mood you've got going here.  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
What are you&ndash;Wait. You're...  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**   
But why do you have to bring me into it?  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
It can't be... Lady Nobunaga?  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**   
If you're going to do this, you might as well finish it yourself. That's always been your worst flaw.  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
...Wh-what are you saying?  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**   
...I can see right through you, Kumquat.  
You were terrified of a world without me, weren't you?  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
...What?  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**   
Even though you killed me yourself, just the thought of going on without me petrified you.  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**   
...That's the difference between you and Monkey.  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
...Difference?  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**   
When I died, he didn't waste his time thinking about a world without me. He thought only of a world in which he was dominant.  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Shut up...  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**   
You didn't lose to him.  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**   
You lost to your own fears.  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Shut up...!  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
What would you know of Lady Nobunaga!?  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobukatsu:**   
Um, can I say something too, Sister?  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobukatsu:**   
Honestly, after hearing all that,  
I'm kind of ticked off!  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobukatsu:**   
I don't know who this guy is...  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobukatsu:**   
...but no one understands you better than I do!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Should've seen that coming.  
   
  
   
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**   
Don't interrupt me, you idiot!  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**   
At any rate, you don't get to use my body.  
It's time for you to give it back, Mitsuhide.  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
...Never mind. I don't care who you are anymore.  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Not when my own Lady Nobunaga is about to be born!  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Heroic Spirit Soldiers! Eliminate these fools!  
  
   
**G：Heroic Spirit Soldier:**   
...!  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**   
Hmm, it seems I went on a little too long.  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**   
I only meant to scope the scene out, but Kumquat's little speech pissed me off so much, I just had to say something.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...We should have attacked while he was talking.  
I think that's what that Saber would have done.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll just have to take these Heroic Spirit Soldiers out!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oh, yeah, good point.  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Okay, Master, let's go!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Izo:**   
...Well? Still alive?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...How about you, Izo?  
You're looking pretty sliced up from where I stand.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
I'm still doing better than you, idiot.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
I was in a really foul mood today, so all this bloodshed is exactly what I needed to let off some steam.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
This worked out great for me.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Hey, Izo, do you see any frogs anywhere?  
Oryou can't move anymore.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
...Even if they are just delaying the inevitable, I can't believe how many Heroic Spirit Soldiers these three defeated...  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Dammit, this ALWAYS happens whenever I let you sweet talk me into something! I KNEW I should've gone and killed the Caster myself.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Haha... Sorry, Izo.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
...Kill them.  
  
   
**Heroic Spirit Soldier:**   
...!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...I can't even lift my arms anymore. Hey, Oryou, hurry up and turn into a dragon or something.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Shut up, Izo, or Oryou will have you for a snack.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Hmph. Guess this is it.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Nope. Perfect timing, as always.  
  
   
**Officer:**   
Wh-what was that!? What's going on!?  
  
   
**H：???:**  
...Hey, you.  
  
   
**H：???:**  
...Are you with Satsuma, or Choushu?  
  
   
## Section 10: Advent  
   
**Heroic Spirit Soldier:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
(...Huff, huff) That's all of them.  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
...Hmm. You are powerful, but you don't seem to be any of the normal Servant classes.  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
Who are you?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...I am another aspect of Okita Souji.  
I am her Alter Ego.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
And I have come here to defeat you.  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
An Alter Ego...? What is that?  
That class doesn't exist in Holy Grail Wars.  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
Hmm... At first I thought he might have sent you,  
but that seems extremely unlikely now.  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
Well, no matter.  
You'll die as easily as the rest of the rabble.  
  
   
**Heroic Spirit Soldier:**   
...!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...Well this sucks. I didn't expect you to be this weak.  
Are you sure you're Okita's Alter?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I'm fairly sure the real Okita would've done at least a little better than this.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, she's really Okita's Alter!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Even Okita herself said she was!  
   
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
...Kill them.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hmm. This could be the tightest spot I've been in since the Nobunaga Siege.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Hmm, so this is the place.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hijikata...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Vice Commander...!  
   
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...What is it, Fujimaru?  
Why are you staring at me like that?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
You're...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Oh, Okita.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
That form... I see.  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
...The Berserker!?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Hey guys. Glad to see you're all okay.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You too, Sakamoto!  
   
**Oryou:**   
Yaaay. Oryou's here too.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You too, Oryou!  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Yup, we're fine.  
All thanks to the Demon Vice Commander here.  
  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
What's going on?  
I thought you'd defeated the Berserker.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Hm? Is that what I said?  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
What's with this guy? His fighting style's all over the place, but he's very strong. Oryou's shocked.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Well this sucks. We'll never be able to show our faces to Okita if this Berserker kills us now.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Hm? Hey, you. Did you just say “Okita”?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...I did! Specifically, Okita Souji,  
Captain of the Shinsengumi's First Unit.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Let me ask you something.  
Don't worry, I won't kill you before you answer.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Wait a second. Does this mean you're not under the Holy Grail's control?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Only I give me orders.  
Now shut up and answer my question!  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Well now, this is a surprise... I'm impressed.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Not even a Holy Grail can sway the Demon Vice Commander of the Shinsengumi. Who would have thought.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
I don't think I've ever seen any Heroic Spirit with such incredible willpower. No wonder you're the Berserker of the Shogunate's end.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...There you have it.  
We ended up calling a temporary truce.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why didn't you just tell us?  
   
**Oryou:**   
For the record, Oryou was against that truce.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Not cool, sitting on this up till now...  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Haha, I used to get that a lot when I was still alive.  
  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Berserker... You can tell that I'm Okita?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Huh...?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
What're you babbling on about, Okita!?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Swords are meant for stabbing and slicing!  
Quit wasting time dwelling on pointless concerns!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Cut them up! Advance!  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
...The Berserker and the Rider? What's going on? Why are all the losers from the Grail War gathering here?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Oh, putting together ragtag groups has always been a skill of mine. You'd be surprised how well people of differing philosophies can come together.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Hmm, the Satchou Alliance was last year's news. How about we call ourselves... the OdaShinsengumiTosa Alliance?  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
No. Too long.  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
What do you think you're doing!?  
Get these idiots!  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
...Hngh!?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Divine punishment.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
You shouldn't have forgotten about me, Caster...  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
You're...the Assassin!?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Hmph, easiest job I ever did in my life.  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
You... You're just a simple man-slayer!!!  
  
   
**B：Nobukatsu:**   
...Sister! Now's your chance!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I know that!  
Come on, can't this body of yours run any faster!?  
  
   
**B：Nobukatsu:**   
...We did it! We got your body back, Sister!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...Hey, that's me! You're over here, right!?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Really? Are you sure?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Just get out of here already!  
  
   
**Nobunaga (True Nobbu):**  
...Phew. Feels good to be me again.  
  
   
**Nobunaga (True Nobbu):**  
Mitsuhide... You've sure caused me a lot of trouble.  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
L-Lady Nobunaga...  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
...What's going on? Why is everyone meddling in my plans!? This is exactly what happened back then!  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
Instead of listening to MY plans for absolute domination, a bunch of fools were deceived by a greater fool who was nothing but talk, preventing me from completing my plans!  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
Why!? Why won't anyone listen to me!?  
  
   
**F：Nobunaga:**   
...I don't know if you'll ever understand, Mitsuhide.  
  
   
**F：Nobunaga:**   
...No matter. It's time to bring this to an end.  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
...I see. So even you have turned your back on me, Lady Nobunaga.  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
Hehe... Hahahahaha!  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
Very well then! If you too refuse to accept my vision of Lady Nobunaga, how I imagined her...  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
...then I shall become the true Lady Nobunaga myself!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What the...!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The Holy Grail...!?  
   
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
When did he get his hands on that...!?  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
Yes... Yes! I am the only one fit to be Lady Nobunaga...!  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
I am the only one who understands her...who can kill her...who can save her!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Hey! What is that sludge!?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Izo, get back! Don't go getting any of that stuff on you!  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
Lady Nobunaga is my light...my guide...my everything!  
  
   
**Mitsuhide:**   
Hehehe... Hahaha...  
HAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Oh no you don't!!!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...What's that thing made of!?  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
MWAHAHAHAHAHA!  
Yes, yes! I am the one, the true, Lady Nobunaga...!  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
I am the god who will grant mankind salvation...  
I am Oda Nobunaga, Demon King of the Sixth Heaven! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  
  
   
**F：Nobunaga:**   
Grr... What is this!? How're you going to act more like me than me!? There's only one me, Kumquat!  
  
   
**B：Nobukatsu:**   
Uh, Sister, I don't think that's our most pressing concern right&ndash;Aaah! The mud is at my feet now!  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
This is bad... Just how many Servants' Spirit Origins did Caster fill the Holy Grail with?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...He's going to end up becoming something on par with a Divine Spirit!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We've gotta do something!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We've gotta find a way to stop him!  
   
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Izo:**   
It's no good. Nothing's working on him, Ryouma!  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Well this is a pretty pickle. I don't suppose you've got any tricks up your sleeve, do you, Lady Nobunaga?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
If I hadn't had to fight you first,  
I could've wiped the floor with this idiot!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
But I can only pull out my killer demon so many times. What about that dragon of yours? Can't she do something?  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Oryou's wiped. Just between us, it's a miracle Oryou's still here after turning into a dragon.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Don't you go wimping out now. This battle's not over while any of the Shinsengumi still live!  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
MWAHAHAHAHAHA! I knew it! I knew you were a fake!  
I'M the real Lady Nobunaga!  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Now, bow down before me! Kneel before the true Demon King of the Sixth Heaven!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Isn't there anything we can do!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...There must be SOME way to win!  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Try to do something about the Holy Grail in his chest.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...I'll handle the rest.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
You? Don't be ridiculous!  
All of us working together couldn't hold a candle to him!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
What could you possibly do all by yourself!?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Okita.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
All right. I wish I could have helped you out myself... Oryou, can I ask you to fight one more time?  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Hmph, lucky for you Oryou still had one last secret frog. Oryou can go at least one more time with this.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Are you ALL idiots!?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
We don't need your whining. If you're not going to help, then get out of the way. Okita, you'd better live up to all that talk.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Hijikata. I remember now. You're Hijikata Toshizo.  
And, the Shinsengumi was my...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Alter...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okita...?  
   
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Nobunaga! I'll pin him down!  
You do something about the Holy Grail!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hey! No mere vice commander of some little wannabe man-slayers club gets to order ME around!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...But I guess I've got no choice this time. Don't come whining to me if you all end up roasted to death!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Izo! You take the right, I'll take the left!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Grr, shut up before I cut both your mitts off, you filthy Wolf of Mibu!  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
It's useless! My Lady Nobunaga is now mankind's one true savior! Its one true god!!!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...Listen, Mitsuhide.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I never wanted to become a god.  
This is exactly why you never understood...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
No, maybe I was the one who never understood...  
  
   
**A：Nobunaga:**   
Let's do this, Rider!  
  
   
**A：Nobunaga:**   
...I shall burn the world and its gods to ash...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Orochi of the earth, sealed by Amasakahoko...  
  
   
**A：Nobunaga:**   
...I am the true Demon King of the Sixth Heaven...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Amakakeru...  
  
   
**Nobunaga & Ryouma:**   
Oda Nobunaga! & Ryu ga Gotoku!  
  
   
## Section 11: Suppression  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Okita's sister once told me that Okita nearly died at birth.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...I see.  
So she lived all her life on borrowed time...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
I might've been a great fool myself, but at least I got to make my foolish decisions on my own. She never even had the chance to decide for herself.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Then maybe she's been summoned here to repay that debt...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Yeah. Her Spirit Origin has been tuned to be used up all at once for the Counter Force...  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
She's like a bomb just waiting to go off.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
She's on a completely different level than me,  
in every possible sense.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Once she goes off, there won't be a speck of her Spirit Origin left.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...I see.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...We're done talking.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Whatever Okita's debts are, they're hers to settle.  
It's none of our business one way or the other.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Yeah, I know. It's just hard sometimes, realizing there's some things in life you just can't change.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
But still, we might be at fault for the way Okita ended up living her life.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
If she does have debts to settle,  
we can at least lend her a hand.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...!  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Well now, this is a surprise. Back when I lived in Kyoto, I heard the Demon Vice Commander had neither blood nor tears to shed.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Of course, that may have been helped along by things like you forcing subordinates to commit seppuku if they went around using the Shinsengumi's name to raise money.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Shut up.  
  
   
**E：Nobunaga:**   
...Now!  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Oryou!  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
RRRAAAAAAHHH!!!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
I AM! THE! SHINSENGUMIII!!!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Hraaaaaahhh!!!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
All right! Gotcha!  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
...You're wasting your time.  
I only needed the Holy Grail to begin things.  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Now that I'm both Oda Nobunaga and a god, your pathetic Noble Phantasms are useless against me!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Ryouma! Now what do we do!?  
This guy's a monster!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Hey, Ryouma?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Sorry, looks like this is it for me.  
Guess I asked a little too much of Oryou.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Oh well. Could be worse. At least Oryou gets to go out with Ryouma. Bye, Izo. Don't forget to brush your teeth.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...I'm sorry, Izo.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
But don't worry. She'll handle the rest.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Ryouma, wait! I said wait, dammit!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Ryouma... There you go again...!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hey, Okita! I got the Holy Grail out,  
but I'm not gonna last much longer!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Thank you, everyone. You did great.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...I'll take it from here.  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Have you lost your mind...?  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Not even Lady Nobunaga herself could stop me. How could a Servant with such a pitifully weak Spirit Origin possibly hope to defeat me?  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Preposterous...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's that light...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The Holy Grail...!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...All right, Okita.  
This is your problem to deal with now.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I'm sorry. I don't think I can bring Mitsuhide back.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
All I can ask now is that you put him out of his misery.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Yes. The version of me that you have all known for so long...  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...and the version of me standing here now,  
who's been by Master's side all this time...  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...both of them are me.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
This moment is why I'm here.  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
...What is that light?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Come with me to infinity...  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Wha...what the!? What's going on!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is this place...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Alter, that outfit...  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I...  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...am a Guardian sent by the Counter Force.  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
The Counter Force...? A Guardian!? No...impossible! This Imperial Capital is completely cut off from time and history!  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
The Counter Force shouldn't be able to intervene at all!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...This is a place of endless nothingness.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
There is nothing beyond or before this point.  
So it is with you.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
This is the endless abyss into which you will fall.  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
The Counter Force...!?  
Don't give me that!  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Does that mean not only Lady Nobunaga rejected me...but the entire world as well!?  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Why? Why!?  
Why, why, why why why why why why!?  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Why why why why why why why why why why!?  
Why why why why why why why why why why!?  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Why does nobody...nobody...accept meeeeee!?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I'm sorry, Master. I wanted to defeat him on my own.  
I didn't mean to drag you into it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm with you to the end, Alter.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hey, Okita asked me to help you too y'know.  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Master.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I'm so glad I met you, Master.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
All right, Caster! No...you false, transient god!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I am the one who rips demons asunder,  
destroys gods, and collects mankind's prayers.  
  
   
**A：Majin Okita Souji:**   
...I am Majin Okita Souji!  
  
   
## Section 12: Reminiscence  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
...This can't be right. If all my hard work...just ends like this...then it was for nothing...  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Back when...I killed you...and fell to him...  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Lady Nobunaga... Please, tell me...  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
I did all of this for you, Lady Nobunaga...  
I consumed a tainted Holy Grail...  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
I spent years on end planning your salvation...  
  
   
**Demon King of the Sixth Heaven - Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
What was different...?  
Why did you choose him over me...?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Now I see...  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
You sought forgiveness.  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
...Forgiveness?  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Is that what I wanted?  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
Forgiveness for killing Lady Nobunaga...?  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
...  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
I see...  
  
   
**Akechi Mitsuhide:**   
I...  
I...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We won...!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Alter...!?  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Yes. It's all over now.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Alter, your body...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...I'm afraid this is goodbye, Master.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
This is the pact I made with the world.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I became a Guardian of the Counter Force, just once,  
to atone for changing my fate so I could live.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So...you really have to go away...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Just once...?  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Sorry for all the trouble I caused you, Master. I'm grateful to you for guiding me when I knew nothing.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
You said you are from Chaldea?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I would have liked very much to see it for myself.  
But it just is not to be.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I'm only a manifestation of the Counter Force. Now that my job is done, the only thing for me to do is disappear.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No... No, I don't want you to go!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't want you to leave...!  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Neither do I!!!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I want to spend so much more time with you!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I want to see so much more of the world!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I want to live so much more...!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I don't want to just disappear...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Alter...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Then come with me! Let's go back, together!  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...I can't.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
This is as far as I can go, as far as the life I borrowed from the world will take me.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Once it's gone...there won't be anything left.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't care! Come on, Alter!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You can't just give up!  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Master.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Thank you for getting angry on my behalf...  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Before I go, I have one last request.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Please, let me touch your face...  
Be with me... Here, by my side...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Like this?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Alter, your hand...  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...There. I can feel it.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I can feel your memories flowing into me.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I have so few memories from after I was born, so...  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...I'm glad...I got to see your memories of Chaldea.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...These memories will be the only proof that I ever lived.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Thank you, Master...  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Thank you for everything.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Uh, S-Sister!? This place isn't gonna last much longer! We've gotta get out of here!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Shut it, Nobukatsu!  
This is nothing compared to Honnoji!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hell, heat this mild just makes me want to break out my Atsumori dance moves.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Hey, man-slayer. You sure about this? The way things are going, you're going to end up buried alive.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Nobody gives me orders, especially not an overgrown wolf... Besides, I still have a job to do.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
And I never leave a job unfinished.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Hmph. Suit yourself.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You guys...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Alter...  
   
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
There you are, Fujimaru. Where's Okita?  
...I see. So she managed to free Mitsuhide.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...I'm sorry for making you two clean up my mess.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Go on. Ryouma entrusted me with making sure you all get out of here safely.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
If I let you die now,  
I'll never hear the end of it.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Hey! I'm the one who was saying we need to hurry and get outta here!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
There, we're finally back online!  
Are you all okay!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Looking at how much clearer our picture is, I'm guessing the situation is pretty well handled!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That entire area is deteriorating! I'm also seeing space-time bubbles bursting at the Imperial Capital's outer edges!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You need to get out of there right now!  
Are you all right, Senpai!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, I'm okay.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Uh-huh.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
...?  
Um, I don't see Sakamoto or Okita anywhere...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
We can ask about that later. Right now,  
we need to get Fujimaru out of there!  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Looks like your ride is here.  
That's my job done, then.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Hmph. Izo of Tosa, eh?  
The next time we meet, I will kill you.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Right back at you, Shinsengumi.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Come with us, Izo!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Isn't there anything we can do?  
   
  
   
**Izo:**   
Forget it. I'm not like the rest of you;  
the Holy Grail summoned me here.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
I'm not gonna last much longer no matter what,  
so just hurry up and get out of here.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Izo... Thank you for helping us!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Thank you, Izo! Take care!  
   
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Idiot. Is that way you say to a guy about to disappear?  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Once an idiot, always an idiot.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
...Well, Ryouma? You happy now?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Damn, so you figured out I was still around.  
Well that takes the wind out of my sails.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
I knew you were probably faking your death just in case something else came up. I swear, can't take my eyes off you for a second.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
She and I have a lot in common, so I thought better safe than sorry. But, it looks like I didn't have to worry.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Hmph... That's just like you.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
But, I guess it's kind of nice getting to talk to you like this, here at the end.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
True. I wonder how long it's been since we last talked, just the two of us.  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Hey, Oryou is right here.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Right, right. Just the three of us, then.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
Hmph... You always were a great fool.  
  
   
**Izo:**   
That much never changed...  
  
   
## Epilogue: A Nice Day for GUDAGUDA  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...All in all, things were pretty rough.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...It sure sounds like it.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Wait, back up!  
Did I seriously get killed off in the second act!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
How could that happen when I was just taking a nap...?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Relax, it wasn't YOU you. The Holy Grail summoned a DIFFERENT Okita there, right?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I mean, yes, I know it wasn't ME me,  
but I still don't like it!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Besides...another aspect of me?  
I had no idea about any of that.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Hmph. What are you worried about?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
This other you repaid your debt to the world.  
You should be grateful to her for saving you the trouble.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
You basically got a “get out of debt free”  
card from all this. What more could you want?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I know that sort of thing is hardly unusual for Servants, but it still doesn't feel right.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...You said she was my Alter, right?  
What was she like, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Your Alter was&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Okita, she  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...So this is Master's Chaldea.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...What?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Say whaaaaaat!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wh-wh-what are you doing here!?  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Master! I missed you! (Glomp)  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
When I came to, I found myself here.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Is this the power of love that Oryou was always talking about?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Bwuuuh!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Hey! You! Palette Swap!  
What are you talking about!? Get away from my Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okita! Alter! Both of you, please calm down!  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Hmph... No fair, Master.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Why does she get to be Okita,  
and I just have to be Alter?  
  
   
**B：Okita:**   
What, why would you be Okita instead of me?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Hah! Shows what you know, Palette Swap! Master and I go waaay back! You? You just showed up outta nowhere!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...All right, I've decided. From now on,  
Master, I want you to call me “Little Okita.”  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Yes, I like that. My name is Little Okita now.  
It's much cuter than just “Okita.”  
  
   
**B：Okita:**   
EXCUSE ME!?  
Just what the hell is THIS!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You seem...different, Alter.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is that what you're actually like, Alter?  
   
  
   
**A：Little Okita:**   
What did I just say?  
My name is Little Okita now.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, uh, right.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Excuse me, Senpai, you have a visito&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? Two Okitas...? And why are they performing a naming ceremony with you, Senpai!?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...What's the meaning of this?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...Hmm. Maybe it's the original Okita's Spirit Origin rubbing off on her? Like when my Spirit Origin temporarily materialized Nobukatsu.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
I knew you'd know what's up, Sister!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I know, right? Wait...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
You're here too!?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Technically, yeah, though I might disappear at any moment.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
But, since I'm here for now,  
I thought I might as well take advantage of it!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
So, where's YOUR room, Sister?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I didn't invite you here!  
Get lost, fool!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Sigh...) I don't even know what to say anymore.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
By the way, Mash, you were saying something about a visitor?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So, what did you want to talk to me about?  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, right, I completely forgot!  
Your visitors are&ndash;  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...Hey there. Sorry for barging in like this.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sakamoto!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are you doing here!?  
   
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Yaaay. Oryou's here too.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
I can't really explain it,  
but we were hurtled here after everything ended.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
And since we don't have anywhere else to go,  
I was hoping you wouldn't mind if we stayed awhile.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sure! We've got rooms to spare!  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Wonderful, thanks.  
I think I'll be very comfortable here.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That should be fine, right, Mash?  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, of course! You saved Senpai's life. Please, feel free to stay and enjoy yourself as long as you like.  
  
   
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Thank you for this.  
What say we get settled in, Oryou?  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Lucky you, Ryouma. Now you get to be the freeloader you always wanted to be. Oh, also, Oryou has an important question: Are there any frogs here?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I, uh, think we're fresh out of frogs...  
  
   
**G：Ryouma:**   
(So she's here too...  
A manifestation of the Counter Force...)  
  
   
**G：Ryouma:**   
(It looks like Izo went back to the Throne...  
So why am I still here...?)  
  
   
**G：Ryouma:**   
(...I guess this means my work may not be done yet after all.)  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
What's wrong, Ryouma?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Oh, nothing.  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
...I was just thinking how this looks like it's going to be the most fun job I've had in a long time.  
  
   
**A：???:**  
Hey! Why's everyone in such a good mood!? What happened while Chacha was out getting ice cream!?  
  
   
**A：???:**  
That Little Okita girl seems really crafty too. Is she trying to steal Chacha's thunder? Wait, I guess not!  
  
   
**A：???:**  
Anyway, they're up to something... Like that old tanuki Tokugawa always was. And there's no way Chacha's letting them get away with it!  
  
   
**A：???:**  
They've left Chacha no choice but to go full Lady Yodo Alter Avenger!  
  
   
**A：???:**  
Hear my call, all you proud warriors of the Toyotomi who I found randomly in the cafeteria! Assemble before me!  
  
   
**A：???:**  
Chacha... No, Lady Yodo will show them what a REAL Imperial Capital looks like!  
  
   
## Isolated Realm of the Far East CHACHA

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nobbu...!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...She's dead!?  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Master, let's go have some oden in the cafeteria.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Hm?  
What's wrong with her?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Oh come on, this isn't anywhere close to oden season. Wait, what happened to you, Nobbu!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Well, I guess if someone had to die, it might as well have been someone nobody will miss.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
If any Japanese historians come asking about you, that's what I'll tell them.  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
I'm not dead, you fools!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Oh, good for you.  
Being alive is much better than being dead.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...So, Master? What do you say to that oden?  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
You care more about oden than me?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Tch... Fine, what is it?  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
W-well, you see... No, wait.  
Sit back and let me spin you a tale of&ndash;  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Just tell us.  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
Hm hm hmm, gotta use the bathroom! That's what I get for drinking too much of that coffee milk David sells.  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
But it's so sweet and yummy!  
If only it played nicer with my tummy...  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
Huh? Beautiful Warring State maidens don't ever use the bathroom? Don't be ridiculous, of course they do. How do you think the Dragon of Echigo died?  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
'Course, I really don't know if the Dragon of Echigo was a beauty or not, but... Hm?  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
What's this? Is someone in the Command Room?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
...How dare you! How dare you all go on this crazy adventure while Chacha was out getting ice cream!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
If His Imperial Highness knew Chacha only had a teensy cameo at the beginning, he'd be so angry, he'd be getting all Odawara on your Sanada Maru asses!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
This is no time to be holding a tactical briefing!  
Also, “Little Okita”? What's up with that?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Beams!? Chacha wants to shoot beams too! Huh?  
Chacha can already shoot lasers from Chacha's hands?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Those aren't beams, you idiot! Those are the cursed flames that consume Chacha from the inside!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Huh? What do you mean that's a real downer of a background story...?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Look, the point is, Auntie may be okay with this,  
but His Imperial Highness won't be!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Now that things have come to this,  
I'll take control of Castellas and... Hehehehehe...!  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
Uh, it's actually Chaldeas, not Castellas...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
...Yooou saaaw meee!  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
C-crap! I mean, I was just going to the bathroom!  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
Hey! Stop that, Chacha! Aaaaaahhh!  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
And there you have it...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Chacha did that!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I mean, I didn't get the spotlight in this story,  
but I suppose she did get even less stage time...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
We've got an emergency! When I woke up, I saw that Trismegistus's simulator had gone haywire! It's opened up a portal to some strange place!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It's probably just the data from the analysis we ran during the last major incident acting up...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Anyway, I'm sleepy.  
I was up all night working, so this one's all you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai!  
Da Vinci told me what's going on!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We need to Rayshift to the problem area right away!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you sure this is worth a Rayshift?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I thought GUDAGUDA was over...  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Are you off to have some fun, Master?  
I'll go with you, then.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Okiter!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Wait, why am I mixing my name with yours?  
I'm the original here.  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
W-wait, Okita Alter...  
Lemme see that badass sword of yours.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
My sword?  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
Yes. I'm afraid we're heading into the fiercest battle in the history of GUDAGUDA.  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
And since my tummy hurts from drinking all of that coffee milk earlier, I can't go help. Sooo, I'm going to infuse your badass sword with my awesome power!  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
Hrnh...!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...What is this!?  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
Heh... I just poured a little over half of my magical energy into your sword!  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
It's no ordinary blade anymore: now it's a demonic godslayer, imbued with the power of the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven...  
  
   
**D：Nobbu:**   
I call it Rengokuken...  
The Sword of Purgatory!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Yikes... Uh, Nobbu, the Warring States period called?  
It wants its bad taste in names back.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Purgatory... From now on, you are Rengokuken.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Whaaa!? You like it!? And wait,  
can you seriously use a sword with Nobbu's power?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Don't you have, like, your own secret Okita power you can draw on or something...?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay, that's enough. See you all later.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This is going to get out of hand quickly...  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
P-please be careful, Senpai!  
  
   
## We the Imperial Capital Seven Spears  
   
**Chacha:**   
Thank you for coming, my Toyotomi elites who happened to see the flyers Chacha put up around the cafeteria!  
  
   
**B：???:**  
No, I'm just here to find out where those weird posters I saw came from.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
I thought we would be making dioramas of Japanese castles... And where's Mr. Blue Spandex who's always hanging out here, anyway?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
The blue one said he would let me handle this and wandered to parts unknown. I'm unsure what he meant.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
That damn flower shopkeep must've made a run for it...! And wait, is it just me, or are there even more people I don't recognize here now?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
At last, I've finally risen to the rank of mid-boss... Huh? I'm not actually gonna get to fight? Aww.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
It seems yet another Saber has been born... Huh? She's an Alter Ego? Don't care! If she's got the face, she's a guilty disgrace!  
  
   
**G：???:**  
This Imperial Capital Chick Custard Dark Matter Schwarzschild Whipped Maxwell Tall Gestalt A La Mode...  
  
   
**G：???:**  
...really hits the spot.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
I thought I'd made a clean getaway this time...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
ANYWAY! Nobody throws a fun, awesome event without Chacha and gets away with it!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Chacha is so FURIOUS, even Chacha's Berserker Spirit Origin might not be able to contain Chacha's rage!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
That's right. Chacha's desire for revenge burns so hot that Chacha has become Princess Toyotomi Avenger Yodo!  
  
   
**B：???:**  
There's what she's saying...and then there's how she's saying it. The dissonance is unsettling.  
  
   
**A：Avenger Yodo:**   
Go, my Seven Spears of the Imperial Capital, sworn to Toyotomi! Drive this world into the depths of despair!  
  
   
**A：Avenger Yodo:**   
Huh? Some of you use bows and laser swords instead of spears?  
  
   
**A：Avenger Yodo:**   
CHACHA DOESN'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF.  
Just go with it!  
  
   
**A：Avenger Yodo:**   
Chacha will also give you some of the special soldiers Chacha stole from Auntie's Spirit Origin when she wasn't looking!  
  
   
**A：Avenger Yodo:**   
Hey, is it just Chacha, or has Chacha's voice changed somehow? Is Chacha leveling up? Or can Servants go through puberty?  
  
   
**A：Avenger Yodo:**   
Well, whatever. Just go already!!!  
  
   
**Seven Spears of the Imperial Capital:**   
Yes, ma'am!  
  
   
**Seven Spears of the Imperial Capital:**   
...Wow, we really didn't think this group shot through, did we?  
  
   
## Coffee Milk after Bathtime  
   
**???:**  
So, you've finally made it all the way here...  
  
   
**???:**  
I am one of the Seven Spears: Wakizaka Katsuharu, the rightful heir to the Oda estate...Oda Nobukatsu!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
You know, Nobukatsu, I've been thinking...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
You really bring up this “rightful heir to the Oda family” stuff a lot, don't you?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Weren't you just talking about how you'd always be there for me? What're you trying to pull?  
  
   
**Wakizaka Katsuharu:**   
Gah! Sister!? What are you doing here!?  
  
   
**Wakizaka Katsuharu:**   
I thought you were cooped up in the bathroom after drinking too much coffee milk!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I was, until Fujimaru came and begged me for help..  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...after [♂ he /♀ she] found out that Okita Alter doesn't do very well against Sabers.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
So, I took some antacid and here I am!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I'm hurt, Master.  
Do you really have so little faith in me?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, no. She just showed up on her own.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah, no. That is not how it went.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Wha!? Et tu, Fujimaru!?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I might've been one of the early game Servants, but I'll have you know I am still in the meta when you are fighting against Divine enemies!!!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Yes, yes, we know. Since we're all here now,  
let's just take care of this and be done with it.  
  
   
**Wakizaka Katsuharu:**   
Why you...! I'll show you how unstoppable Sister and I were in Owari once we teamed up!  
  
   
**Wakizaka Katsuharu:**   
Come forth, my Super Mecha Nobbu Mk. II that I made from a bunch of scraps...in a cave!  
  
   
**Super Mecha Nobbu Mk. II:**   
No-No-No...Nobbu!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
What the hell is that?  
It's nowhere near October, dummy.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Huh? Why are you looking at me like that?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...I swear on my Rengokuken,  
I will vanquish the Demon King!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Did I miss something!?  
  
   
## Senpa...  
   
**A：???:**  
Good of you to come, Master of Chaldea.  
I am Fukushima Eminori, one of the Seven Spears!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Cafeteria Guy!  
   
**Fukushima Eminori:**   
Uh, could you just pretend that's someone else for now? Not that I'm even okay with the whole “Cafeteria Guy” tag to begin with, but you know...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No weird mask this time, I see.  
   
**Fukushima Eminori:**   
Of course not. I may change my hairstyle at times,  
but I will not rely on cheap gimmicks.  
  
   
  
   
**Fukushima Eminori:**   
...Though I'll admit, I may have missed the proverbial boat when it comes to worrying about my standing.  
  
   
**Fukushima Eminori:**   
Still, I understand Chacha's frustration with being left out, so here I am.  
  
   
**Fukushima Eminori:**   
Now come on!  
I might make a lot of different weapons...  
  
   
**Fukushima Eminori:**   
...but none of them hold up well against Servants who have mastered only one!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
This feeling...  
I don't suppose you're my Guardian senpa&ndash;  
  
   
**Fukushima Eminori:**   
Let's not go there.  
  
   
## It's Not Like Nothing Can't Not Be Done Without a Spear  
   
**A：???:**  
...So, you've come.  
  
   
**A：???:**  
Would you like some tea before we...  
No, that's probably a bad idea.  
  
   
**A：???:**  
I am Katou Shuwen, one of the Seven Spears of the Imperial Capital!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...This guy's strong!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Even his name's badass!  
  
   
**Katou Shuwen:**   
Kakakaka, easy there! I'm not here for work this time!  
I responded to this call for personal reasons.  
  
   
**Katou Shuwen:**   
As long as I get to put my spear to use, I'm happy.  
  
   
**Katou Shuwen:**   
Besides, there's something about that Servant with the enormous longsword that gets my blood pumping.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
That's the Lancer we saw back then...and he's even stronger now, Master.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
This is clearly no place for comic relief...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Keep your guard up! I wouldn't put it past this Lancer to cheat and use his bare fists or something!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...That's all right, though. I'm stronger now than I was back then, too. Let's do this, Lancer!  
  
   
**Katou Shuwen:**   
Indeed! Let us see just how close you have come to achieving true mastery!  
  
   
**Katou Shuwen:**   
My Baji needs no second strike. ...Hrn!  
  
   
**Katou Shuwen:**   
Bleed from all seven orifices of your skull...as you die!!!  
  
   
## The Voice of a Mini Nobu...!?  
   
**A：???:**  
I am Katou Medeaki, one of the Seven Spears!  
Make sure you don't confuse me with Katou Kiyomasa!  
  
   
**Katou Medeaki:**   
Wait, what kind of introduction is THAT!?  
I don't even know what it means!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks for doing this.  
   
**Katou Medeaki:**   
Huh? I should actually be playing Kiyomasa? Because he was great at building castles, and I'm good at making models?  
  
   
**Katou Medeaki:**   
So what!? This isn't a trivia game!  
Why should Japanese history matter to me!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe Katou Yoshiaki then?They were known as calm and collected.  
   
**Katou Medeaki:**   
Huh? What is this, some kind of trivia game? Did I not make it clear I don't care about Far East history!?  
  
   
  
   
**C：Ryouma:**   
...I take it you asked for my help because your opponent is a Caster?  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
When Oryou and Ryouma work together...there is nothing Oryou can't handle. Yaaay.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Everyone knows Riders beat Casters, right? Help me out here!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Watch out for her Rapid Words technique, Hundred Flying Daggers!  
  
   
**Katou Medeaki:**   
...This guy has my Untrustworthy Hot Man Radar screaming at me. You there! Are you sure he's being totally honest with you!?  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Huh? Have you been tricking Oryou all this time, Ryouma?  
  
   
**C：Ryouma:**   
Don't be silly, of course I haven't.  
How long have we known each other now?  
  
   
**Katou Medeaki:**   
...Hmph. Handsome men like you always say that sort of thing. I used to fall for it, too...  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Yeah, you're right.  
There's no way you'd lie to Oryou.  
  
   
**C：Ryouma:**   
Come to think of it, why don't we go on another trip sometime soon? Being in Chaldea has given us a little more free time, after all.  
  
   
**Katou Medeaki:**   
...  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
Hey, good idea. We haven't done that in a long time.  
Maybe we could visit Takachiho again or something.  
  
   
**C：Ryouma:**   
Boy, that brings back memories.  
  
   
**Medeaki:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um, Medeaki?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Uh-oh...  
   
  
   
**Katou Medeaki:**   
That does it! I am a tolerant woman, but I CANNOT STAND PDA! If you're going to act like swine, then I'll use Circe's Loser Fist to turn you into swine!  
  
   
## Good Work  
   
**???:**  
(Sigh...) I really thought I'd managed to avoid this for once...  
  
   
**A：???:**  
Oh, uh, right. I guess I'm Katagiri Medumoto?  
There's something about the Seven Spears in there, too.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You know...that outfit's something else, isn't it.  
   
**Katagiri Medumoto:**   
I don't know why I keep getting caught up in these things...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I guess this gives you the GUDAGUDA hat trick.  
   
**Katagiri Medumoto:**   
Yes, yes. Let's not think about that.  
  
   
  
   
**Katagiri Medumoto:**   
Anyway, I'm gonna come at you with everything I've got, so just hurry up and beat me already. Please.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Are you sure about this?  
You don't really seem up for it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you're not gonna change outfits this time?  
   
**Katagiri Medumoto:**   
I'd heard there were talks about that, but apparently they were scrapped because of deadline issues.  
  
   
**Katagiri Medumoto:**   
I'm not sure what that was about,  
but honestly, it came as a relief.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
I wouldn't mind a new outfit myself...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can't wait for the theatrical release!  
   
**Katagiri Medumoto:**   
I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about,  
but I can say that I highly, highly recommend it.  
  
   
**Katagiri Medumoto:**   
So please make sure to check it out! (Winning smile)  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
A theatrical release...  
I guess I learned something new today.  
  
   
  
   
**Katagiri Medumoto:**   
Anyway, I still have a lot of reading I'd like to do, so let's get this over with and then I can go back to my room. And my books.  
  
   
**Katagiri Medumoto:**   
Come on! Oh! And don't forget! I'm weak to Assassins, so make sure to put some on your team to make this faster!  
  
   
**Katagiri Medumoto:**   
Also Alter Egos!  
  
   
## Legend of the Mightiest of the Bakumatsu, IZO  
   
**Mysterious Seven Spear - Kasuya Heroine X:**   
Hey! That was a super cheap shot, you know!  
  
   
**Mysterious Seven Spear - Kasuya Heroine X:**   
I wouldn't ever have seen it coming if I wasn't Mysterious Seven Spear Kasuya Heroine X!  
  
   
**Mysterious Seven Spear - Kasuya Heroine X:**   
I can also tell from the way you wield your blade, you're no Saber!  
  
   
**Man-slayer Izo:**   
...Indeed, I'm neither Saber nor Assassin.  
  
   
**Man-slayer Izo:**   
I'm...a man-slayer!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So, this is already happening, then...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wait... Izo?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Huh? You're here too, Izo?  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
Wow, I haven't seen that getup of yours in a long time. That takes me back to our Kyoto days.  
  
   
**Man-slayer Izo:**   
Ryouma! I hear you're living it up in Chaldea now, after you left me behind for dead!  
  
   
**Man-slayer Izo:**   
I KNEW you would trick me!  
  
   
**Ryouma:**   
I-I wouldn't say “trick” exactly...  
It's just, one thing led to another, and...  
  
   
**Oryou:**   
What a waste of a satisfying climax.  
  
   
**Mysterious Seven Spear - Kasuya Heroine X:**   
As I am the one true Saber, I cannot allow a stupid Assassin to go around acting like a Saber! It's wrong! Wrong I tell you!  
  
   
**Mysterious Seven Spear - Kasuya Heroine X:**   
You all hate Saberfaces too, right?  
So let's take this faux Saber down like the punk he is!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Uh, X, you know you're an Assass  
  
   
**Mysterious Seven Spear - Kasuya Heroine X:**   
Heroine X's Saber Power can save the Imperial Capital! Have faith!  
  
   
**Mysterious Seven Spear - Kasuya Heroine X:**   
Cool? Cool!  
Thanks for joining my Heroine Alliance, guys!  
  
   
**Mysterious Seven Spear - Kasuya Heroine X:**   
Oh, and as for you, Alter Ego?  
  
   
**Mysterious Seven Spear - Kasuya Heroine X:**   
We need to have a little chat about that face of yours. Meet me behind the gym after school gets out!  
  
   
## Short Soy Terrible Milky Light Straight...  
   
**A：???:**  
Welcome. It's so good of you all to come. I'm Hirano Ex, one of the Seven Spears of the Imperial Capital.  
  
   
**Hirano Ex:**   
I'm also the manager of Dark Rounds,  
the hot new sweets café that's sweeping the galaxy.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sweets...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can't believe that menace sunk its claws into the capital too...!  
  
   
**Hirano Ex:**   
This is a wonderful place.  
  
   
**Hirano Ex:**   
I've never seen such perfect blends of Eastern bean pastries and classic Western sweets.  
  
   
**Hirano Ex:**   
It was just begging to expand on a galactic level! Franchises in every solar system!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
You really do have a lot of delicious-looking sweets...  
I think I may buy some myself...  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Yes. I'll take one of these, please.  
  
   
**A：Ex (Manager):**  
The Dark Rounds Bean Sponge Cake? Of course. That'll be two dollars, please. However, if you want it to go, I'll have to ask you to wait a little longer.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Not a problem. I'll just have it here with Master.  
  
   
**A：Ex (Manager):**  
Oh, all right. In that case, you may go ahead and have a seat at one of the tables in our dine-in area. Anyway, as I was saying...  
  
   
**A：Ex (Manager):**  
...Unfortunately, Manager Ex's joy was short-lived when she realized something terrible.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Something terrible?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can I please have one of your Galaxy Chick Sweet Custard Buns?  
  
   
**Hirano Ex:**   
I...I just realized... Since I am the manager...I'll never get to eat any of these sweets myself...!  
  
   
**Hirano Ex:**   
The only thing I can do now is defeat you,  
and make you take over as manager!  
  
   
**Hirano Ex:**   
So, on that note...get ready for a fight. When fine sweets are on the line, you'd better believe Ex is gonna give it to you!  
  
   
## Goodbye GUDAGUDA, Until We Meet Again  
   
**Okita:**   
...So this is the throne room.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
What was the deal with all those weird Mini Nobus, anyway? Is it just me, or did they sound broken?  
  
   
**Avenger Yodo:**   
...So, you've finally made it this far,  
evil servants of Tokugawa.  
  
   
**Avenger Yodo:**   
I'm impressed you managed to defeat my Seven Spears...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can we just go now? It's dinnertime and I'm hungry.  
   
**Avenger Yodo:**   
Really? Chacha wants curry! With a little flag in it!  
Oh, and lots of honey and apples!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Uh, I'm pretty sure none of us are with Tokugawa?  
   
**Avenger Yodo:**   
Don't argue with Chacha's backstory!  
  
   
**Avenger Yodo:**   
When you get right down to it, this whole Imperial Capital thing was Tokugawa's idea in the first place!  
  
   
  
   
**Avenger Yodo:**   
Hey! Don't try to change the subject!  
  
   
**Avenger Yodo:**   
Chacha is no longer Chacha! Chacha is Avenger Yodo, the empress of Toyotomi who burns with fiery vengeance!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Master, I know this situation seems like a joke that's gone too far, but she is seriously powerful! I think she may have reached a point where the Counter Force needs to get involved.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Then, wait... Does that mean that the whole reason I am here is for this moment!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, I reeeally don't think so.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think the Counter Force is better than that.  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Yes, I suppose you're right. If that were the case,  
I'd have to disappear all over again.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Thank you, slightly-stronger-than-average person.  
  
   
**Avenger Yodo:**   
Why does Cha&ndash;Avenger Yodo get the feeling you're not taking me seriously!?  
  
   
**Avenger Yodo:**   
All right, that does it. Now that it's come to this, I'll show you just how powerful I've become.  
  
   
**Avenger Yodo:**   
Taste the power I gained from the unyielding fury that turned me into an Avenger when I learned that you had finished the WHOLE event without me!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Wha...!? I thought I'd destroyed that!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Why is there a Holy Grail in Chacha!?  
  
   
**Avenger Yodo:**   
Heh... I found it lying around when I got here!  
  
   
**Avenger Yodo:**   
After I'd finished eating ice cream out of it, I felt incredible power surging through me...power to change the whole world! Or...something...  
  
   
**Avenger Yodo:**   
Now, nobody can stop me! Soon, Tokugawa's infernal city will be little more than dust!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Dammit! I guess we have to fight! Come on, Alter Me!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Got it, Normal Me! If two Okitas join forces, we can unleash limitless Okita Power. Now...  
  
   
**Double Okita:**   
...witness the power of Double Okita!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Chacha:**   
...Nghhh, Auntie, that's Chacha's coffee...  
...Yaaawn... (Zzz)  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Hehe... She's sleepy. She looks so peaceful.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That was a hell of a fight, huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That Double Sandanzuki was pretty sweet.  
   
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Indeed. I could never have won without your Command Spells and Normalkita laying down her own life.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
From now on, I'll need to work hard enough for the both of us in order to support you, Master...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Alter...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If only Okita hadn't pushed herself so hard...  
   
  
   
**Okita:**   
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm not dead!  
I just fainted a little! That's all!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Don't go getting all weepy on me now!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
You certainly have it hard, don't you, Normalkita?  
I can't imagine what it's like myself.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Huh!? But not even the Holy Grail can cure this curse!? Why do you get off scot-free when we're both Okita!?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
   
...Ah! Huh?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
What's Chacha doing here...? Oh, hi, Master.  
Hi, Okita. Hi, Okita. What's going on?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We were all just about to go home together.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It...uh, it's a long story.  
   
  
   
**Chacha:**   
I see... Chacha didn't know Chacha did that... Chacha's sorry for all the trouble, Okita, um, Alter, right?  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Don't worry about it.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
Besides, I was born just a short while ago.  
All of this stuff is very exciting to me.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
It's a wonderful feeling, being alive.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Born recently... Is that so... Hmm...  
Maybe I did get a little carried away.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Maybe we can start over?  
It's nice meeting you, Alterwhatsit.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...How strange. Hearing someone as small as you call me that is...oddly calming.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Hehe, is that so? Well, you can think of Chacha as your mother! Ask me for anything!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
And make sure you bring Chacha ice cream on Mother's Day!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There, I finally got through!  
Are you all right, Senpai!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, more or less.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can we just have dinner now, please?  
   
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
Good, it looks like Chacha's back to normal.  
Well done, Master.  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
Now hurry back before supper gets cold.  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
I really must say, though...this pudding I found in the fridge while you were out sure is tasty! (Smacking lips)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah! Nobunaga, that's Chacha's&ndash;  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
...Pudding you found in the fridge?  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
Mm! The oden we're having for supper is especially tasty, too! (Munch munch) I always did love strong flavors! Wahahaha! I can't put it down!  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
What? Is this all we had? Oh, sorry. I guess I ate it all for a snack while I was waiting for you guys.  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
...Oden?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll buy more oden and pudding, okay!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oh no...  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger Yodo:**   
DEATH TO AUNTIE!  
NO MERCY!  
  
   
**Okita Alter:**   
This...is the power of the Counter Force...!  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
...Huh? What's the matter with you two?  
Doesn't this seem weird to anyone else?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
(Sigh) Here we go again...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yep, that's GUDAGUDA...  
   
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
W-wait! It couldn't be heeelped!
