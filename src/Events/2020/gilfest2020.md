# Battle in New York 2020  
   
## A New Battle  
   
**Nero:**   
That's right! It is that time of year once again!  
I am proud to announce the fourth Nero Fest!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Hehehe. Quite the jubilant reception, is it not,  
Fujimaru? And who can blame them!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Of course it is! This is a festival of Rome, by Rome, and for Rome! Why shouldn't I be excited!?  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I have prepared plenty of prizes once again, and would like nothing better than for everyone to test their strengths against one another in fierce competition!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Though it hardly need be said that I will be this year's victor! Yes, this is the year where all will sing my praises as Rome's greatest swordsman!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see you're in a good mood, Your Imperial Majesty.  
   
**Nero:**   
Of course! The mere fact that Olympia shall open its doors again is enough to content me!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You don't mean...infinite Guts...?  
   
**Nero:**   
Heh heh heh. Some things are better left unsaid.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Nero Fest is getting a bit long in the tooth, so I thought it would be a good time to present myself in all my steamy goddesslike glory!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Forget the Venus de Milo!  
Now is the time for the Venus de Nero!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpaaai! Emperor Nerooo!  
Excuse me, please let me through!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Phew, what a crowd. I'm a little exhausted just from making my way here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Still, it just goes to show what a great success Nero Fest has been, and how much everyone loves it. I think that's a wonderful thing.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Umu, you will have to forgive me for my overwhelming success! That aside, you look even more daring than usual today, Mash!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you. Please watch me, Master.  
I'm going to do my very best again this year.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
My goal is to place at least in the top ten!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Only the top ten, Mash? Shouldn't you be aiming for first? You are Chaldea's signature Servant and all.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Not to mention that this year's Nero Fest prize is exceptional. Even more so than usual!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So for my part, I was really hoping Fujimaru would be the one to take it home.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Morning, Da Vinci!  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Morning! I'm glad to see you haven't forgotten your manners!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
“Never forget to properly greet someone,  
no matter what's going on.”  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Or at least that's what we've been doing since the Incineration of Humanity.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
An exceptional prize...?  
   
**Nero:**   
Oh, come now, Da Vinci! Don't give the game away so early! Wait until my official announcement!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oops, right, of course. So sorry about that.  
It just slipped out.  
  
   
  
   
**Nero:**   
Umu. It seems all the participating Servants have assembled.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Then we shall proceed to the Colosseum.  
See you later, Fujimaru and Mash.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
We will be broadcasting the opening ceremony in the cafeteria via Sheba, so feel free to bask in its glory from here.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Yeeeaaahhh!  
Neroooooo!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Uncle!? It is too soon for you to be cheering for me yet!  
I appreciate your enthusiasm, but please wait until the ceremony...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
   
Yeeeaaahhh!  
Empty treasury Neroooooo!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
What do you take me for, some petty tyrant who used up all her nation's money!? I will admit I came close to that once, but I never went so far as to&ndash;  
  
   
**Nero:**   
...Wait. Were you speaking of Rome's current treasury, Uncle!?  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
...Heh.  
(Smirking in agreement)  
  
   
**Nero:**   
That cannot be right! All the money I have been saving over this past year was in that treasury!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Along with the Holy Grail I had purchased from Da Vinci to present as this Nero Fest's grand prize!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A Holy Grail!?  
Your “exceptional prize” is a Holy Grail!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yup. Every now and then, a Singularity comes along that ends up disappearing on its own.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And when it does, it sometimes leaves a Holy Grail behind. They may not be the best-quality Grails, but they're still pure, crystallized magical energy.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So when one of those low-quality Grails falls into our lap, it's my job to retrieve it, polish it, and make it into something usable.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Emperor Nero happened to find me fixing up the latest such Grail, and I agreed to let her have it at a fair price as long as she made it her grand prize☆  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You really are a genius...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Fair price? Do I even want to know how much QP you charged?  
   
  
   
**Nero:**   
This will never do! We cannot have Nero Fest without a suitable prize! Uncle, who is the villain responsible for&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wait! Sheba just turned on!  
It's about to show us something...!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hahahahaha! Greetings to you at this late hour of 3:00 a.m., my fellow Heroic Spirits!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Oh, wait, it's morning there, isn't it?  
Hahahaha, forgive me. Just a little KoH humor.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I have lost all sense of the various time zones here, as there is neither day or night in this city!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Truly, this is a glittering cityscape even at night, worthy even of me! Perhaps that tells you where I may be speaking of?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Now then...I must first convey my apologies to the Saber in red regalia.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fifth Emperor of Rome, all of the money you worked so hard to save...now belongs to me.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Caesar knows why. You should ask him.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Though of course, he is most likely long gone by now. Indeed, there are few things more frightening than being related to an unrepentant grifter.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
“Yes, I admit that I am deep in debt, a not inconsiderable portion of which I owe to you.”  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
“But here is how I see it: I am the embodiment of Rome; therefore, my debt is Rome's debt.”  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
“Accordingly, those affiliated with Rome are my family, and must stand in joint surety with me.”  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
“And as it happens, there is a magnificent vault right here filled with riches. Riches enough to repay my debt in full.”  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Juuullliiiuuusss!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Heh. And so the contents of your vault are now mine. Unfortunate, but that is how it is.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
However! While I may pity you, I cannot commend you!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
A sporting spectacle for Servants to pit their skills against one another? A fourth Nero Fest? You fool!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
What were you thinking, using the same arena all four times!? And a decrepit relic as the Colosseum at that!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
If I were running this festival, I would ensure my contestants compete in the greatest arena in the world.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
For example...the pinnacle of entertainment,  
right here in Manhattan!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
The Garden!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He's in New York!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And here I thought he was all about the good old days...  
   
  
**Nero:**   
What!?  
An all-weather stadium!?!?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hahaha, did you think I spent my time in that tropical resort merely idling the hours away? Of course not!  
I have been planning this ever since that trip began!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Furthermore, I declare here and now, that it is THIS festival which will determine the strongest Servant!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
And so I have come to New York! The only place in the world suitable enough to act as the stage for this historic event.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
To all you Heroic Spirits watching this now, listen well!  
I have opened a gate in Chaldea that will take you here!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Those among you who fancy yourselves the strongest of all Servants, come to New York and prove it.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Needless to say, this event will also consist of team battles. I await you here, atop this skyscraper!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Once you have defeated all the other challengers...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...that is when I, the Golden Archer, the oldest King of Heroes in all humanity, shall pass my final judgment!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Furthermore, my full-time secretary, Moolah, has prepared a host of incredible prizes for you to win!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fight hard, play hard, and challenge me for supremacy! Now is the time to prove that you are the strongest!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hehehe... Hahaha...  
Haaahahaha!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can't believe it...  
Gilgamesh took over Nero Fest!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And, um... I'm sorry, Emperor Nero...  
I... I don't know what to say...  
  
   
**Nero:**   
What to say... What to say...  
What... What...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...(I have no idea what to say to her.)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nero...?  
   
  
   
**Nero:**   
What...an incredible idea!  
You are right, accursed King of Heroes!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I have been clinging to my Colosseum like a fool! If there is a better stage to be found in the modern era, then that is what I shall use.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Flashy lights! Gleaming skyscrapers! Classy champagne flowing from bottle to glass in the very poshest of penthouses!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Umu! Enemy though he may be, I must commend him on his decadence, his ostentatiousness, and his sheer wealth! That is what entertainment should be!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I will gladly accept his challenge!  
Hear me, all you Heroic Spirits gathered around!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Nero Fest may be no more,  
but our festival itself remains unchanged!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
This event shall henceforth be called...  
Battle in New York 2020!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
That arrogant King of Heroes clearly believes that HE is the strongest one of all! Let us show him how wrong he is!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
We shall pummel him with the full force of our greatest Noble Phantasms and send him tumbling off his high perch!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Now that's the emperor we know!  
   
  
   
**Nero:**   
Umu! Just leave it all to me! To be frank,  
I am looking forward to visiting New York myself!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Hehe. Fujimaru, Mash.  
This is where our competition truly begins.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Only one team will be able to challenge the King of Heroes. I cannot wait to see who emerges victorious!  
  
   
## Before the Awards Ceremony  
   
**Mash:**   
So this is where the finals will be held...  
Huh? Emperor Nero?  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Mash and Fujimaru!?  
What is going on here?  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Is this not the site of the final battle?  
Has there been some kind of mistake!?  
  
   
**B：???:**  
It is no mistake. I determined from the start that there would be two teams advancing to the finals.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That sounded like...Gilgamesh!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That sounded like...Gorgeous P!  
   
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hahaha, I expected you would make your way here, mongrels! You have put on a most entertaining show!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
As your reward, I shall give you the opportunity to compete directly with your king. You will have a chance to bask in the honor as you fall to the ground.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
So you mean to take us all on at once? If that is what your pride as a king demands, I have no objections.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
But first... I know that my reserves alone could not possibly have sufficed to pay for this extravaganza.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
So tell me, just how much did you spend to put on this event?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Heh. I would estimate it cost about three times what you had in Rome's treasury...but that isn't to say I had to spend much myself.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
One came up with a business deal to restore your treasury's funds. It succeeded brilliantly, so you now lay claim to several times what you did before.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
It is no wonder he is known as one of the Nine Worthies. His powers of elocution are no less effective in modern show business than they were in his own time.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
He must have been thinking harder about how to help Nero Fest succeed than you were.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Caesar... He certainly has his share of issues, but I guess he really was worried about you, in his own way.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Umu! That is all I needed to know.  
Now we can focus entirely on our battle, King of Heroes!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
This festival may belong to you now,  
but I still have my own pride as an emperor!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Besides, it is not the proprietor that is the star of the show, but the brave heroes who take part in it! Now, as the undisputed strongest of them all, I shall reclaim the Holy Grail that is rightfully mine!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Foolish emperor. That is exactly why I will be fighting you in this form. The King of Heroes has been the star of this show from the beginning, and the star I will remain to the end.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Unfortunately for you, I have grown tired of counting my money and playing the kind, understanding king.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
No, what I have in store for you is nothing less than hell itself! Your half-baked heroism will not be enough to defeat me!  
  
   
**Gorgeous P:**   
Hahaha, I expected you would make your way here, mongrels! You have put on a most entertaining show!  
  
   
**Gorgeous P:**   
As your reward, I shall give you the opportunity to compete directly with your king. You will have a chance to bask in the honor as you fall to the ground.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
So you mean to take us all on at once? If that is what your pride as a king demands, I have no objections.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
But first... I know that my reserves alone could not possibly have sufficed to pay for this extravaganza.  
  
   
**Nero:**

**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
What!? This cannot be right!  
When did I find my back against a wall!?  
  
   
**Gorgeous P:**   
What!? This cannot be right!  
When did I find my back against a wall!?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Curse you, curse you, curse you!!!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
They manage one good hit, and suddenly I'm the one who's wounded and plummeting to the ground!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Tch, it would seem this is the end for this manifestation! Once I hit the ground, that will be it for me!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
But don't let this go to your head, mongrels! Remember, I am the kindest of all my various permutations!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Next time, I shall return as an even more refined King of Heroes! Enjoy the championship belt while it is still yours!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...yooours!  
...yooours!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
...yooours!  
  
   
**Gorgeous P:**   
Curse you, curse you, curse you!!!  
  
   
**Gorgeous P:**   
They manage one good hit, and suddenly I'm the one who's wounded and plummeting to the ground!  
  
   
**Gorgeous P:**   
Tch, it would seem this is the end for this manifestation! Once I hit the ground, that will be it for me!  
  
   
**Gorgeous P:**

**Gorgeous P:**   
...yooours!  
...yooours!  
  
   
**Gorgeous P:**   
...yooours!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We... We...  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
We did it, Master! I've confirmed that the...um...New York King of Heroes has returned to Chaldea!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Indeed he has! Victory is ours,  
Fujimaru and Mash!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Congratulations, Nero!  
   
**Nero:**   
Umu. Umu, umu! Do not stop now!  
Keep lavishing me with praise!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Thank you for your support during battle,  
and for leading us to victory!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You did great, Mash!  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you, Master, but I didn't really do anything compared to you, and not just in this battle!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I could never have made it this far without your orders and support.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The King of Heroes was right! This was a team victory. And as our team's leader, you deserve the lion's share of the credit.  
  
   
  
   
**Nero:**   
Oh... Look, Fujimaru.  
That is the Holy Grail I prepared for this event.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
That accursed King of Heroes must have fitted it to his championship belt. But it should still work fine!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Take it for yourself, Fujimaru.  
I have no need of it.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I am the one who secured it in the first place, after all, and it would be completely improper for an event's proprietor to go home with its grand prize.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
In that case, don't mind if I do.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Then I'll just use it on you.  
   
**Nero:**   
U-umu, I see.  
How can I refuse such a kind offer...  
  
   
**Nero:**   
(Perhaps it is due to my mother and that poison affair...but Holy Grails make me nervous...)  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
I've retrieved the Holy Grail.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I wish we could stay and enjoy the nighttime view a little longer, but Da Vinci just asked us to head back to the arena immediately.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Umu, the victors have been determined! All that remains now is for them to stand atop the podium!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I am proud to call you my heroes, brave warriors!  
Now, let us be off!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I declare that the Battle in New York 2020 has officially come to a triumphant end!
