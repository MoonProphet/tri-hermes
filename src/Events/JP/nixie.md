 **Da Vinci:**   
Alright, rayshift is successful!    
Even though there were some risks to this rayshift this time around, we had to check how serious the situation was first.    
Are you ok, Guda?  
  
**Guda:**   
I’m ok!    
Perfect rayshift as always!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
  
I see, I’m glad to hear that.  
  
**Mashu:**   
  
Master’s vitals are perfectly fine.    
I’ll be in the Control Room repairing equipment, so in that time, I’ll try my best to process any information.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
  
Alright, I’ll be counting on you.    
Anyways, that’s the situation for you. The more we have in the Control Room, the better.    
Yea…As always the peculiarity of this rayshift still remains the same.    
    
**We don't know where that place is.**    
    
This rayshift is needed to confirm the coordinate data and its existence, but we do know that the place is located somewhere on this Earth—    
Since it is “unidentifiable” to us, it’s as if the monitor is glitched on our end.    
Even though the singularity is never changing, we decided to upgrade the security by a tenfold and rayshifted them into the unknown coordinates.    
How about it? Do you have any clue about this place as you see it?  
  
**Guda:**   
Well, it looks like a southern country beach…  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
We’ve been having difficulties investigating since we’re getting ambiguous readings over here…  
  
**Mashu:**   
Maybe analogue elements like…cloud shape, temperature, and wind scent could give us clues.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Ah. That would mean that I would have to get the girls’ opinions on this next.    
For a singularity that’s unknown, it has a very wide scope in terms of rayshift aptitude, but for now, I picked the Servants that had the highest aptitude to be your escorts for the first round.  
  
**Guda:**   
Ummm….  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/7wzumet6bzr81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2a5c18942ddab0b3134777b283edb07afbddf93)  
  
**Ereshkigal:**   
Sorry, but I don’t know this place.    
I am the ruler of the underworld. I don’t have ties to a place that looks too resort-like.    
I’m to say once more that it doesn’t have any sign of an underworld.    
  
Underground…well. It’s different from a cave, but it feels like it has many holes.    
That’s all I can say for now. But since I was chosen, that means I have a role to play here.    
  
It’s been a long time since you’ve relied on me, but if you need anything, just tell me!  
  
**Guda:**   
  
I’ll be counting on you!  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/n79l1pd7bzr81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=1003ece1f3ddbc37a3277374b9be2fe34a55d9b3)  
  
**Wu Zetian:**   
  
I don’t know this place either. All I know is that it’s a rural area.    
    
Though, it seems nice and well compared to my splendid Luoyang.    
    
You, underworld girl! You better not bring those ghosts near me!    
    
They’re not scary though, well, it frightens me when they pop up behind me!  
  
**Lambda:**   
  
For a stage that welcomes a gorgeous star, it looks too barren.    
    
Who am I kidding, it’s hot. Not like steamed buns, but it’s very hot.    
    
Was I really suited for this? Do you really need my powers in my place like this!?  
  
**Mashu:**   
  
Seems like you guys don’t know where it is…    
    
At any rate, this seems like an unusual combination.    
    
It seems like you three don’t interact a lot, so why?    
    
Well, everyone’s rayshift aptitude is derived from many factors, but it’s apparent that you guys don’t have any correlation to this place.  
  
**Wu Zetian:**   
  
We don’t know, but well…    
    
As the first one on the list, is the commonality here being a scary and beautiful woman? Kuhaha!    
    
…Hm, hey, don’t just stand here you bureaucrats.    
    
Take some leaves over there and make me a chair with a sunshade canopy.    
    
Hurry up, I feel like my skin is about to melt off my face! You’re in charge of waning the leaf fan!  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/ombwqr58bzr81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed49f7e8417759c8757dc040bd000dd006055e84)  
  
**Lambda:**   
  
It’s obvious that we’re the beautiful stars that wow the crowd. Your country, my aquatically, and her underworld.    
    
I assume that the commonality here is that we’re rulers…number one in our respective place, right?    
    
Ah, now now, hold it there, my leviathans.    
    
Don’t go into the sea now! Stay! We don’t know if any of this is safe.  
  
**Ereshkigal:**   
  
Even if they’re in the water, my spirits have begun moving vigilantly within the area.    
    
(It’s been a really long time since I’ve been requested to accompany him… I’m so glad, but I have to be careful and serious)    
    
(As a representative of the underworld, I’ll show you how worthy I am of being a goddess!)  
  
**Guda:**   
  
Hmm…Commonality…    
    
Maybe you guys all have henchmen of your own…?  
  
**Ereshkigal:**   
  
Huh, wait a minute? Seems too sudden, but I feel like I found something.  
  
**Guda:**   
  
Way to go, Eresh-chan, you’re so reliable!    
    
Where, where, what is it!  
  
**Choice 1:**   
  
**Ereshkigal:**   
  
R-really? It’s such a blunt compliment, is that what you call being frank?    
    
Ahem.    
    
Let’s not get carried away. We now have more detailed information from my Gallu—Hmm, what’s this?  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/kkyw5ft9bzr81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=cba3395a40a5ddc0b6e778d0dfe648422fa233a8)  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
  
….  
  
**Mashu:**   
  
Something just now…  
  
**Wu Zetian:**   
  
Is that yours? I didn’t know they come in different colors.  
  
**Lambda:**   
  
What. Don’t lump them with my leviathans.    
    
…Well, they were a bit cute.  
  
**Ereshkigal:**   
  
I only caught a glimpse, but it seemed like they were native to this land…right?    
    
We might gain more insight about this singularity from them. Let’s follow them for now.  
  
**Guda:**   
  
Agreed!  
  
**Wu Zetian:**   
  
Accepting the rightful opinion of an empress is how it should be. Alright, bureaucrats, go fetch the litter! Go, go, go!  
  
**Lambda:**   
  
Seems like they made the leaf chair before you even noticed. They sure work fast…  
  
**Lambda:**   
  
There it is!  
  
**Wu Zetian:**   
  
Hm? Wait, is that—  
  
  
  
[this thing moves to fast for me to screenshot](![image](https://preview.redd.it/jc63akwabzr81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=608f24f19b003e1ab8266ad294deabe9f7dfe0ac)  
  
**Ereshkigal:**   
  
Something is chasing after it!?  
  
**Wu Zetian:**   
  
I see. What will you do, Master?  
  
**Guda:**   
  
Let’s save it!  
  
**Lambda:**   
  
Words without any hesitation or deception.    
    
Fine then. No matter how unsatisfied you may be with this ensemble, we are stars that give our audience our all.    
    
Liven up, my leviathans. Let the first act begin!

**Wu Zetian:**   
  
This is an enemy I’ve never seen before.  
  
**Guda:**    
  
Seems like a merman to me…  
  
**Lambda:**   
  
Not an ounce of beauty left. I wouldn’t be on the same stage as you till the day I die.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
  
Yea, it’s hard to get a remote analysis. This seems like a challenge.  
  
**Ereshkigal:**   
  
Where did that thing we saw earlier go?  
  
**Mashu:**   
  
Found it! It’s alright.    
    
…Eh…?  
  
**Ereshkigal:**   
  
Ahwaawa, there’s more of them!?  
  
**Wu Zetian:**   
  
Don’t panic, goddess of the underworld.    
    
As long as there is life, there will always be a group of them.    
    
It’s a bit unexpected, but stay calm.    
    
Being calm is showing what you’ve got to stand on top—

**???:**  
  
Thank you!    
    
You saved us!    
    
You’re so strong!  
  
**Wu Zetian:**   
  
I-it talked—!?  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/1c4j9a8fbzr81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=589790f50e049750c615f75e9aead4878e451e36)

**Guda:**   
  
H…Hello?  
  
**???:**    
Is this the rumor we’ve been hearing?  
  
T-the greetings things.  
  
According to our **boss,** greetings are important. H..hello?  
  
Wu Zetian doesn’t seem to get a bad impression of them. Lambda is a bit jealous of them that they’re trying to play with her leviathans, but doesn’t mind them since they’re a bit cute.  
  
**Ereshkigal:**   
  
At the very least, they’re not spirits. Speaking of which, they’re not common creatures as well.  
  
Da Vinci is surprised that they’re intelligent life that can speak. However, Da Vinci can’t get an accurate observation of them because of the impact of the unknown singularity. Mashu says that they’re focused on monitoring Guda’s life force.  
  
Lambda asks them what and who they are.  
  
**???:**  
  
That is a good question.  
  
We are ourselves?  
  
That’s deep.  
  
We are just here because we are?  
  
Of course, these things are very playful as they play with Lambda’s leviathans, Ereshkigal’s spirits and Wu Zetian’s bureaucrats. As they continue to play, the things smell the “Boss’s” scent to which a Servant comes.

**???:**  
  
Hm..?  
  
**???:**  
  
I think…they’re not sea monsters, sister.  
  
**???:**  
  
Well. Then that would mean— Kaahh.  
  
**???:**    
Boss. Let’s play.  
  
**???:**  
  
We have been saved and we’re reporting! Shall I say both!  
  
**???:**  
  
Wait, wait, wait a bit, please? Let me speak to these people, ok?  
  
**Guda:**   
  
Ummm…you guys are?  
  
**???:**  
  
Ah…ahem.  
  
I am Trung Trac. And this is—-  
  
**???:**  
  
….  
  
**Trung Trac:**   
  
Come on Nhi-chan, it’s rude you know? You always say that first impressions matter.  
  
Come now, go out there and introduce yourself!  
  
**???:**  
  
…Trung Nhi. I am her younger sister.  
  
**Trung Trac:**   
  
That’s right, let’s say you barely passed. Be a bit more sociable next time.  
  
Anyways, with that out of the way, we both are the Trung Sisters.  
  
We realized that we were here as servants summoned to this land…is what we think.  
  
You introduce yourselves and Da Vinci gives a run down of the situation about this microsingularity. Trung Trac understands the weight of the situation. Ereshkigal asks for information, but the Sisters don’t have any to begin with.  
  
**Trung Trac:**   
  
The moment we were summoned here…these kids were being attacked by some monster.  
  
Trung Nhi praises her sister for being a charismatic leader. Trung Trac states that they came here the moment they were told one was being chased and now you’re the ones that saved them. The Trung Sisters both relay their gratitude towards you for saving them.  
  
**Lambda:**   
  
By the way, what are these creatures anyway?  
  
**Trung Trac:**   
  
You mean the Cons. I’m sorry, I don’t really get them either.  
  
I think that they were in this region from the very beginning.  
  
Ah, Cons is just something that I named on the spot. A more nuanced way would be “friend” in our native language.  
  
I thought it would be troubling if I didn’t name them something.  
  
Da Vinci asks if this is all of them, but Trung Nhi replies that this is not all of them since there are still more scattered elsewhere within the region. Even with the numbers that they have currently, they still don’t know how many of them are in total. Trung Nhi notices that we’re just standing here talking, so she invites us to talk at another place. Lambda makes a comparison between the Cons and Passionlip saying that they’re similar but not at the same time.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/c170tuard8s81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=53446926cd1e1524e8de9b184302b2d213afa7de)  
  
**==ARROW==**  
  
Da Vinci starts giving the group information about the Trung Sisters.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
  
The Trung Sisters were from the first century AD and northern part of Vietnam.  
  
During that time, it was under the rule of the Han Dynasty and that district was the Han-Dynasty outpost in Vietnam.  
  
The ruler who was sent there from the Later Han Dynasty treated people very poorly.  
  
In the midst of smoudlering discontent and the murder of Trung Trac’s husband, the Sisters took this opportunity to initialize a rebellion…or at least that’s how it goes.  
  
Wu Zetian is aware of this and that this is the Jiaozhou region and heard about this somewhere in her life since this is a story that was 600 years after the Sisters lived. Wu Zetian already suspects that she knows how the conclusion goes.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/fpg5ebosd8s81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea1650c0206ec24f26d85aa72adc0d9a13629aa4)  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
  
With Trung Trac as the leader, the rebellion party had gained massive momentum and in one instance, they attacked the castle with the help of about 65 towns.  
  
In the end, a suppression army was dispatched from the capital towards them…  
  
Trung Trac interrupts by asking if they were talking about her and Da Vinci apologizes and admits. The Trung Sisters don't mind it all with Trung Nhi being a bit embarrassed. Trung Trac asks about the identity of Wu Zetian and Wu Zetian confirms her identity and tells them that the Sisters died 600 years before Wu Zetian was born.  
  
Ereshkigal assumed that the Trung Sisters hated the other side because of their past, but the Sisters don’t seem to care and Trung Trac explains that the Sisters had to do what had to be done and they don’t seem to mind if an empress was standing in front of them. Trung Nhi threatens Wu Zetian that if she hurts Trung Trac one bit, she’ll cut down everyone here. Trung Trac knows that this is cold, but it’s nice to confirm your values and stances.  
  
**==ARROW==**:  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/rr9utldtd8s81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=67c6aeeacedcce71b43204ded9ade82f550f0f15)  
  
You arrive at a village built on water which is where the Trung Sisters live. The sisters say that they were the ones that taught the Cons how to do things like build and were very skilled at it. They introduce you to the “Elder” of this village. Ereshkigal does not find the talking turtle to be very surprising as she refers to how talkative sheep may be. The elder says that Ereshkigal is a bit much for his age and that he prefers someone who is blunt and black haired, while Ereshkigal is jealous that he prefers someone like Ishtar than her.  
  
Da Vinci asks who this Elder really is and Trung Trac responds that he is this very island. The Elder says that he enjoys talking with youngsters and he jokes with them by ending his sentences with “game”. Trung Trac tells the Elder to take it seriously.  
  
**Elder:**   
  
I am sorry.  
  
I suppose you’re right. I have lived for a long, long, long time…I think.  
  
I have forgotten why I am here, here on this sea…  
  
Though I do remember one thing.  
  
This land is supposed to be the soil on my back. A seed that has sprouted in the shape of this island.  
  
In other words, you guys are **standing on top of me** right now.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/8msigqzud8s81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=7072e51fac0a7a3229fa8116f48f4f46878f306b)  
  
Everyone is shocked by this revelation. The Trung Sisters want to talk inside a hut instead of the entrance. The Elder says that he’s sorry if it doesn’t really feel like the islands are floating, but he just kept swimming and swimming which became a habit. Da Vinci confirms that it’s true. The Elder reassures that the main body never moves and in a deep state of sleep from which it’ll never awake or it could be dead, but the Elder isn’t sure since he’s here in a very small form separated from the main body. Lambda thinks that he’s a bunrei and the Elder can’t confirm since it's been too long and now he just wants to bask in the sun along with the Cons. Wu Zetian asks his relationship to the Cons and the Elder has no affiliation with them and that they were harmful.  
  
**Elder:**   
  
However, I do remember this. Not to long ago—  
  
Frightening creatures from beyond the sea, beyond the fog, started appearing.  
  
Mashu is puzzled and Lambda wonders if it was the mermen.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/8pcqi9mvd8s81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb4df49d1e4485bc708685426b44b2a09fa48dd9)  
  
**Elder:**   
  
No, it’s just not them.  
  
There were things that possessed hoofs, things that looked like humans. There were a variety of them.  
  
The thing they had in common was that they were all dwelling sea demons…. They were sea monsters.  
  
And before I knew it, more and more of these sea monsters showed up and started stealing from the land, living here and devouring the Cons.  
  
However, when everything was about to be stolen, these sisters had appeared.  
  
They fought them off, nearly avoiding everything here from being stolen.  
  
A good way to put this… is that only this area of the region remains.  
  
**Trung Trac:**   
  
Even if it was the last thing standing, I’m glad that we made it in time.  
  
It wasn’t possible for just the two of us to go on the offensive alone like that.  
  
But with this, we bought enough time for allies to come forth.  
  
Da Vinci grasps the situation. Trung Truc says that they believe they were summoned here to save the Cons and can’t think of another reason why they were summoned here. Da Vinci states that this is a microsingularity because there is an anomaly and we need to fix it. Trung Trac says that sea monsters have special characteristics and asks us how we defeated the merman. We say that we just defeated them normally. Before Trac finishes her sentence, Cons are in trouble.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/ahfitdiwd8s81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2b2bab8fd42400fb3f8b8dee2bb0c64283a221b)  
  
**==ARROW==**:  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/qmpk8w3xd8s81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7a9f7c3c8a2bde17fec7d2e5b60207243c15205)  
  
Mashu compares the Trung Sisters as Dioscuri and Anne and Mary.   
  
The Trung Sisters state that Cons need to do the finishing blow. Killing sea monsters fresh out the sea is fine, but if they eat a Con, they’ll just come back. However if the Cons defeat them, the monster will be defeated and the eaten Con will come back to life. The Trung Sisters continue stating that Cons can sense danger, but can’t do damage. You offer them help and Da Vinci will send in reinforcements since the Rayshifting aptitude seems to be large for multiple Servants.  
  
Trung Trac politely asks for another favor. She wants to expand this village and wants a roof over the Cons’ heads here. We just have to bring materials and help expand.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
  
We’ll send in a Servant who’s skilled at construction and gathering materials.  
  
I’ll go ahead with the selection process.  
  
**Mashu:**   
  
Collecting materials and building facilities… It makes me feel very nostalgic.  
  
This mission would be a breeze for Master!  
  
Let’s get some materials to add onto the village first!  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/84b4lacyd8s81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a8ea20a959c518af997e54ceb12ae6a2042f4fa)

**Semiramis:**   
  
Hou, hou. I was wondering what they wanted when they called for an empress…  
  
Supervising the construction and collection of materials? That’s a surprise…  
  
I hope you guys aren’t making fun of me.  
  
….Of course, my Noble Phantasm “Hanging Gardens of Babylon (Aerial Garden of Vanity)” was physically assembled using materials from my homeland.  
  
Though I don’t mind collecting materials, engineering and construction—  
  
I didn’t think that you would request an Assyrian empress a role like this and not for ruling and poisoning…haha.  
  
I’ll ask you again for clarification, Master. I’ll be the one making the decisions now whether it be a joke or not, right.  
  
…Are you insane? Are you really insane?  
  
Depending on your answer, this might become a tetrodotoxin case.  
  
**Guda:**   
  
Please!  
  
I’ll be counting on you!  
  
**Semiramis:**   
  
Hah. Good lord…  
  
Hurraaa!!  
  
It’s magnificent if I say so myself.  
  
There’s no harm in its sense of unity, while it is flexible, it’s also strong.  
  
This was the first time a floating residence was on the water, but this might be a good addition to the waterside area of my hanging gardens.  
  
Semiramis praises her own skill and we praise her which we get 100 QP. She says that the economy is important when it involves large scale projects like this. Wu Zetian doesn’t believe that the Cons are skilled at building. Semiramis praises the Cons that they’re able to move and do this while under her leadership. With that Trung Nhi states that the Cons have a safe place to stay now and relays her thanks. Ereshkigal lets Trung Trac do the planning for specific operations and Trung Trac is nervous, but will somehow manage. The scenes with Mashu tell you to do our best to help rescue the Cons.

## Section 2: Priestly Questions and Answers

Trung Nhi wants to start at places that are close to the village. Ereshkigal agrees with her because it’s efficient in terms of attacking and being attacked. Trung Trac explains that in different parts of the region, there are also different kinds of sea monsters that roam around here. She also states that usually one type of species would come through the fog, but now it’s more than one and there’s a sea monster that looks like a human. The sea monster that resembles a human is an enemy that Cons cannot get a finishing blow on.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/lxh0obh32ds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed12c58b6bd0b65fa20dd4c1ff31d2fd92ac2756)  
  
Benkei call them Poor Monks. Hozouin wants to test his spear and prayers to see if they work out. You find these Monks and Benkei notices that it is speaking about hermit crabs and solves it as such.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/h9pz8o142ds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5301750b400c03c9d5ca57787f6085aea6e2fc0)  
  
After dealing massive to the enemy, Benkai goes on to tell the legend that in certain areas of Japan, hermit crabs roam around to ask people questions in the form of a hermit crab and if they don’t answer, they are killed which is what a crab spirit is which is also what Benkei calls it.  
  
More hermits appear and the situation becomes more perilous. Since you can’t through the shells to strike the enemy itself and being too afraid to trigger the resurrection of the enemies, you retreat to the village to discuss further plans.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/susj7ns42ds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d6f820311365f93dc8eb4b67a944f57f564928f)

Trung Trac announces that she thinks Cons should have weapons and Trung Nhi agrees as well. There are some that agree while there are some that disagree with that notion. You decide to ask the Cons about what they think.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/vbg734q52ds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c261a99630a3c825b8468f36ee6cb9bcaa0418f)  
  
**Con:**   
  
I don’t want to be eaten.  
  
I want to play more.  
  
I want to sunbathe.  
  
—What about you boss?  
  
**Trung Trac:**   
  
Eh?  
  
**Con:**   
  
Boss, what will make us happy?  
  
Trung Trac hesitates for a bit before answering that she doesn’t want to get eaten, but doesn’t want to lose their innocent nature. She still is unknown about their connection. Trac reminisces about her past when things had to change, she knew she had to stand up. Of course, after hearing this the Cons are willing to fight.

After this Nagiko and Raikou emerge from the intercom and say that a katana, like a big katana, should be best for them. Nagiko explains that she has heard everything and has gathered people who are well suited for this type of situation. Leonidas comes in and says that a lance is the best weapon for them since it is safe and easier to wield and the Cons can be buff like he is. Amakusa thought about Black Keys, but it would be difficult for them so he suggested a pile driver since it’ll be easier for them to crack the shell. Semiramis asks you about construction work and Amakusa goes, ending the conversation.  
  
**Mashu:**   
  
With all that said and done— I shall leave the weapon selection to you!

Construction 2 Choice A: Let’s Acquire Katanas  
  
Trung Trac asks if this is ok and Lambda says they’ll be alright. Lambda says that the sisters are so in sync that it seems like they’re dancing and that it’d be a waste to dance on top of a turtle and asks if they’re interested in the stage and Trac doesn’t have anything to say in particular. We cut to Minamoto no Raikou asking the Cons how the swords are and the Cons seem to love it.  
  
**Minamoto no Raikou:**   
  
Very well. Now—Genjis advance!  
  
**Con:**   
  
Genjis advance!  
  
I don’t know what that even means!  
  
**Benkei:**   
  
It seems like we have more cute Genji retainers.  
  
If Ushiwakamaru-dono were here, she’d be excited for them.  
  
Guda advances forward with them along with Benkei.  
  
Construction 2 Choice B: Let’s Acquire Lances  
  
**Leonidas:**   
  
—-I’m so happy. I couldn’t be happier.  
  
We don't have time nor the equipment, but I shall rigorously train you right now…  
  
**Trung Nhi:**   
  
Seemed like they just wanted to play.  
  
Lambda says that motivation and willpower are important and with Leonidas, they’ll be perfectly fine, so they start training.  
  
**Guda:**   
  
At any rate, his might is awesome.  
  
This is…Sparta!  
  
**Benkei:**   
  
Indeed, as expected of the King of Sparta. He has commendable leadership and encouragement skills.  
  
Now, let’s go and not fall behind with these poor monks, Master-dono!  
  
**Construction 2 Choice C: Let’s Acquire Pile Drivers  
  
Semiramis comes in to ask where a red robed idiot went. You respond that he didn’t come and Mashu explains that all he did was suggest some weapons and the pile drivers were something that was requested by Galatea and other Servants with similar weapons. Semiramis says that she could have had him leading the Cons. Ereshkigal asks if she will help since she’s here and Semiramis says that she won’t since she has a contract with you in collecting materials and supervising the construction and she says her farewells. In the end, Galatea says that the weapons are fully functional and ready to go.  
  
  
## Section 3: First Area Recapture Battle  
  
You and the others face the Hermit Crabs again but with Cons having weapons as well. Da Vinci has set up a support program to monitor the damage dealt to the enemy so that you don’t have to consider how hard you hit the enemy. The program is supposed to alert you when you have done enough damage to defeat it, but not to make it disappear and regenerate.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/y5nvgrd84ds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=3facb74032a46c09c83f40adf42428a63b1fdb07)

You defeat the Hermit Crabs properly without having it to regenerate. Trac relays her gratitude towards you for giving Cons weapons and identifying the enemy, and now you have claimed the first area.  
  
With Hermit Crabs being the enemy, Benkei suspects that the location might be off the coast of Japan, but Da Vinci isn’t definitive about that yet. It seems that a mist also covers the sky at night thus you can’t get any clues out of it. The scene ends after Mashu striving to get more areas cleared and rescue more Cons and a foreboding narration appears.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/s7pgxq994ds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebb2251fcf51d5774f041f501a1209e3fbcc6b88)  
  
A phenomenon beyond expectations has occurred.    
    
However.    
    
The bait and those who feed on it. It shall never cease.    
    
The cultivation continues.  
  
## Section 4: Intermission  
  
**Habetrot:**   
  
Is it really alright for us to rayshift like this?  
  
**Morgan:**   
  
I’m sure they don’t mind. The wake was left behind after all.    
    
If they didn’t want anyone trespassing, then they should have put up a trespassing sign.  
  
**Habetrot:**   
  
I guess you’re right.    
    
(...Seems like Morgan could intervene with the wake in her own way, I didn’t think she could do that.)    
    
—-Well, it’s whatever! Let’s go have fun and walk around!  
  
**Morgan:**   
  
Hm.  
  
**Habetrot:**   
  
Something just came out of the ground!  
  
**Morgan:**   
  
Is this the rumored Con…that I’ve been hearing about. Hm.  
  
**Con:**   
  
?  
  
**Morgan:**   
  
(Stare)  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/7bi8wbhb4ds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fb5cf54fe4a2a204fbea50a70d10772c43b6b4e)  
  
**Con:**   
  
This is awkward for me.  
  
**Morgan:**   
  
A faerie…? No, it’s a bit…different…    
    
……..    
    
Well, as long as it’s not a caterpillar, then I shall allow it.  
  
**Habetrot:**   
  
Eiii. Ahaha, you’re a bit different from a cat, but you’re so adorable!    
    
You’re so nice, squishy, heavy and full of substances!  
  
**Morgan:**   
  
Wait, Habetrot.  
  
**Habetrot:**   
  
What’s with that scary face? They’re not dangerous at all you know?  
  
**Morgan:**   
  
….I am interested in their magecraft characteristics. Let me hold them.

Chapter 4-2:  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/h5drpqtc4ds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7ef839b21eefd65712125c5d69c83240305e11a)  
  
You have a hard time sleeping so you go out for a night walk. You find Ereshkigal doing nightly patrol with her spirits. She’s flustered when she takes notice of you and is embarrassed that you saw what she’s been doing in secret. She thinks that it’d be unsuitable for her if she was constantly nervous and overly attentive to detail. Your compliments flatter her, but she still feels down because she doesn’t know why she’s here.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/af5nvbad4ds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=95e2cea36b748d14fb4012f10f1a6c2fbc4effe5)  
  
Ereshkigal:  
  
…Well, it’s a bit odd, we know nothing yet we still move forward.    
    
I guess, the atmosphere of this island is a bit off. Sure, it’s a nice place and all, but there’s more to it….    
    
…Well, whatever.  
  
Ereshkigal thinks that you should stop worrying about her lonely shift and go to sleep. As such, she even gives you a cold spirit in case you’re getting too hot to sleep. As you go to sleep, she reflects on how nice of a time it was to be alone with you.  
  
   
  
## Chapter 5: The Monster Coming to Devour  
  
  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/pc9p1owatds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=791702026bdfaf0430ecd62e697d447d485352d6)  
  
Da Vinci confirms that the drone can’t get anything beyond the sea and fog which ends up being another dead end on the island’s geographical location. The stars don’t come out at night and the water quality doesn’t match any other pre-existing places. Da Vinci wants to discuss other things with the Sisters and says that there’s no rush to this investigation.  
  
Lambda notices Trung Trac and Trung Nhi talking. Trung Trac is considering handing the role of leader to someone else since she’s not fit to be one. She thinks that someone is better at giving orders around and she has no self-confidence. However, she changes her mind and wants to give it her all. The Sisters start playing around and talking about how adorable the Cons are. Lambda interrupts and the Sisters try to play it off by discussing the plans.  
  
We noticed that they were just trying to relax and we apologized. Trung Trac thinks that relaxing is a bit uncharacteristic of a leader. You say that it’s fine to relax once and a while. The Sisters say that we’re going to the next area. The sea monsters there are very strong and the Sisters have fought them multiple times. The enemies are still unknown and have other characteristics to them. Trung Nhi says that they look like dogs. Mashu says that support is on the way.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/ly74ae9ctds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=3db39c7bb4c9b2a1d6306540ae46f181fd3b8cb2)

Nagao Kagetora arrives as support. She says that although she can’t detect the presence of enemies, she can at least kill them which is pretty much the same thing she says. She compliments Trung Trac leadership and her history.  
  
You go into the area of influence and a water hole appears and a sea dog emerges. Kagetora doesn’t recognize it as it is not from Japan. She, then, takes one step forward and engages with the enemy. The plan of dwindling down the enemy so that the Cons can finish them is still in effect.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/m01hf0bdtds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bda3e31e9a4f151266a05c26be02f8e45fd45f5)  
  
However, the sea dog is too fast for you guys to land a hit. The monster quickly gobbles the Cons up. More emerge and the situation becomes dangerous. As more monsters eat the Cons, Lambda quickly saves one.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/7mb0njudtds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=e07bf38dd05da4f9bda0d8db7d51aa60e0080649)  
  
**Con:**   
  
Thank you!  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/1dhb2idetds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d540f2a46ca03128c3ebc11b097a61b9c11b985)  
  
**Lambda:**   
  
You’re very welcome!  
  
Get behind me! No, stick with me!  
  
That high level of movement and transition… We might be able to intercept them.  
  
Your group prioritizes rescuing as many Cons as possible so you retreat back to the village. The group contemplates about the monster’s speed. Kagetora thinks that it’s not fast moving  
  
**Nagao Kagetora:**   
  
It’s always moving to someone. In other words, it doesn’t rapidly move when there’s nothing there.  
  
Additionally, if we look back at how it ate them front and behind—  
  
It feels like their eye contact is unnatural. If that’s the case, then…  
  
I think it’s like a “kill those you see” type of nature.  
  
I think they manifested in the form of rapid movement!  
  
Da Vinci thinks that this is a possibility, but Mashu figures out the enemy that they’re facing.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/21qd6efftds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=517eb42e2b9618f84372a60ca9d28361fc08c968)  
  
**Mashu:**   
  
Yes. I was looking up the enemy through our database just now and it’s an Australian Sea Monster—  
  
We got a hit and it’s called a Bunyip.  
  
The appearance is not clear, but there’s no denying that it resembles a shark and dog.  
  
They make loud cries, live by the waterside and their best trait is…  
  
They say that they simply “kill those they see”.  
  
Da Vinci reinforces that once something is in their line of sight, they won’t let their prey get captured. She thought that they could go off with the material they obtained with the Hermit Crabs, but it was useless. The group decides to combat the speed by giving them armor.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/78gp4fxftds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=3401f42f0827066580af359fc58461b74f1ffaef)  
  
Ushiwakamaru interrupts to say that she has heard their troubles and wants to give Cons Genji armor since she says that it is light so that they can move fast while providing great defense. She came in because she was jealous that Benkei was having all the fun.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/7wzcfzcgtds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=c183c2a03ccee975bf49cb588155eca28b59cfde)  
  
Caligula proposes that they should wear Roman Armor. Romulus, Caligula and Nero all agree to this and Caesar states how there are a lot of people in favor of this.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/9avcciwgtds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=47ea38b8609edeedba82b6d88b6fbce9e95e56cc)  
  
Mecha Eli appears downplaying their armor and telling you that the many suitable armors for defense are spatial armor, reactive armor, complex armor. She thinks that while it may look rough and may be overboard, it’s up to you how you design the armor itself. Scene ends with Mashu leaving the Armor Selection to you.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/8wj176chtds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=576f3028801b29b7f99a11a4228fb3f029dd1a92)  
  
**Construction 3 Choice A: Let’s Equip Genji Armor  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/rbs03yqhtds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b7a6f0eb53ec9b15f54e7519fb721aaec1f131c)  
  
Ushiwakamaru is excited that they have put on Genji Armor. She asks why you’re not wearing the armor, but you’re equipped with a Mystic Code. She says that it’s been a long time since she’s led an army. Kiichi Hogen arrives and states that Benkei didn’t want Ushiwakamaru to come so that she would most likely deal the finishing blow which is supposed to be the Cons’ job. Kiichi Hogen is here as a chaperone and tells her not to cut off any heads.  
  
Kiichi Hogen was asked to investigate the Cons since she’s an intelligent type Servant. She is confused and surprised whether this is actually an organism or not. She feels like eating it since it looks like a steamed bun. Of course, Trung Nhi advises her not to do that. Since the Cons are wearing Genji Armor, they’re essentially Genji retainers, is what Minamoto no Raikou said.  
  
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
  
“Fight valiantly and without shame.”  
  
Now then, let me say this on your behalf.  
  
…Genjis advance!  
  
**Cons:**   
  
Genjis advance!  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/qea5fhcitds81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=7309de4b283c0e59380948e4b48bde6913efa5c9)  
  
**Construction 3 Choice B: Let’s Equip Roman Armor  
  
Caesar says that they’ve already won since they’re now in Roman armor. Da Vinci made sure that the armor wasn’t anything flashy. Cleopatra has come along as well and says that she’ll have no choice but to fight. Trung Trac compliments her beauty and Cleopatra starts talking about her beautiful aura. She senses that Trung Trac is a married wife and Trac starts talking about her husband and his death. Cleopatra apologizes for bringing up something horrific. To make up for that, she gives them coupon tickets to her beauty store. Caesar and Cleopatra talk about establishing business here since it’s tropical. Da Vinci stops the conversation and tells Caesar to demonstrate his leadership skills.  
  
**Construction 3 Choice C: Let’s Equip Mecha Armor  
  
Mecha Eli is delighted and starts a final strength exam to reassure the armor’s defenses and it passes. This makes Mecha Eli conclude that it will do perfectly fine against the sea monster’s teeth. Trung Nhi questions its weight since it is made out of steel. This is new technology made by Mecha Eli who doesn’t share the details. She says that it is fully compatible with their strength and speed. Trung Trac is amazed by their advancements in technology. Mecha Eli is sad that she couldn’t make more upgrades to the armor like lasers and missiles. The scene ends with Da Vinci telling them that with this type of armor, they can fully combat the sea monsters.  
  
   
  
## Chapter 6: Second Area Recapture Battle

You face the Bunyips again, but this time when they go to eat the Cons, they bite the armor instead and it gets shocked. Nagao Kagetora takes this as an opportunity to strike and Wu Zetian commends the armor’s defense. Trung Trac commends you for making the armor, but you say that Trung Trac should relay those words to the Clothing Department, Miss Crane, which she shows up as well.

Miss Crane says that this request was a bit different from idol so she took this as a learning experience. She compliments the Trung Sisters’s costume and wants to inspect it later. Habetrot came as well because she felt like she was being called for so she had to leave Morgan behind, and she talks about metal bride dresses before going into battle. The Trung Sisters use this opportunity to attack the Bunyips and defend the Cons, saying that they won’t lose.

Nagao Kagetora uses her Noble Phantasm against the Bunyips and deals massive damage. The Cons do the finishing blow and the eaten Cons are saved. Trung Trac says that while they’re grateful for the help, she discusses that now that we have bigger safe areas, we’re going to need to keep an eye on more of them so that more sea monsters don’t appear out of nowhere to which Wu Zetian replies that the bigger the land, the harder it is to protect it.

Da Vinci says that for now they should calm down and relax before claiming more land. Da Vinci will survey this new area that they’ve claimed just now and send in more people to help. So you go back to the village to relax.   
  
In other parts of the land, Lambda is relaxing somewhere else while some Cons are looking at her. A Con pops out and relays their gratitude towards her for saving her twice. The Con gives her a beautiful flower as her way of saying thanks. Lambda wants to give something to the Con.

I have a ribbon in my hoodie. Come.    
    
Well. I’m not really good at manual labor, I thought that this would do it…    
    
Alright. Now I can tell you apart from the others.    
    
Think of it like…a benefit for being the first member of my fan club on this island.    
    
I guess it’s more practical than an air kiss, I’d say.  
  
**Con:**   
  
Wow! So pretty! Thank you so much!

Yea. Yea.

Calamity Jane is strolling around when she finds some Cons. She gives them an English greeting which the Cons don’t know since they know the Japanese greetings. Later, the Cons meet Lakshmi Bai and use a greeting that combines English and Japanese greetings. She wonders what kind of language this is and the Cons explain that it is a greeting. She greets in her langage “Namaste” which is a greeting among Hindi speakers.

Back in the village, the Cons greet you with a greeting that combines all the greetings that they have learned so far. A particular Con with a red ribbon sticks out which you question. Lambda says that it is her number one fan. Da Vinci is interested in the Cons’ culture and intellect since their existence is very unknown. Ereshkigal feels like when one of them knows the plan, all of them suddenly know the plan. In the end it’s still a mystery since we don’t see them all hours of the day and they could have some telepathic ability. Da Vinci says that it is almost time for the scheduled meeting with the Trung Sisters.

Lakshmi Bai and Calamity Jane report that the west and east side of the island is fine with no sea monster rising. Trung Trac relays her thanks and Lakshmi Bai states that security does play an important role.

**Calamity Jane:**   
  
Yes. There were no incidents in today’s patrol…but what happens when something unforeseen happens?    
    
Let’s say tomorrow, yea, what if a sea monster emerges the moment I avert my eyes for one second?    
    
Do we have any plans for such a scenario?  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/jaqpsf65ifs81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=88d7bc039545fac4666d59803c9a82ec4891959f)  
  
Da Vinci says that while it is good to have patrols, it is also impractical to do so due to how big the island is and it would be a waste of a lot of materials. Trung Nhi proposes a tall watchtower that can see everything on this island. Lakshmi takes this as an opportunity to suggest that Cons assist with taking shifts and if anything happens, they can immediately report it to us. The Cons happily accept, but Trung Nhi wants them to know how to get to safety when something happens. Da Vinci says that they’ll do easy check-ups.  
  
Now the question becomes, what kind of watchtower they want to build. Da Vinci suggests the Leaning Tower of Pisa. She wants to see it emerge since her older self said that it was complete and that the leaning wasn’t intentional and her artistic soul is tingling. Although it is optional, she just wants to see it.

Sanzang emerges and proposes a five story Pagoda which she says can bring good fortune. Nitocris appears as well to propose a Pyramid since it is a big structure after all and starts comparing it to Ozymandias who also appears, but he doesn’t mind if they go with any other option, since everything that isn’t built by him is an imitation of his greatness. However, if they manage to build it up to the very finest detail, then he’ll allow it and tell Nitocris to not cut corners if they decide to build it. The scene ends with you selecting what to build.

**Construction 4 Choice A: Let’s Build the Leaning Tower of Pisa  
  
Da Vinci is impressed by the architecture even though she’s busy. Semiramis, on the other hand, doesn’t get the beauty of building a tower at an angle. Da Vinci praises Semiramis’s skills and explains that it was due to special circumstances concerning the ground it was built on. Semiramis compares this to a baby sand castle.  
  
Trung Trac arrives to be stunned by its magnificence and worries that it’ll tip over and fall. Mashu reassures her that it was perfectly calculated so that it won’t fall over. Trung Nhi has a worrisome expression just like her sister. Da Vinci says that it is designed to be climbable as well. Trung Trac says that it’s better to jump off if they’re trying to run away. Some gas is emitted before going to the next area.  
  
**Guda:**   
  
What’s going on, a weird fog…?    
    
Did it drift from the sea…?  
  
**Trung Trac:**   
  
Be careful, everyone! This is—-!  
  
**Construction 4 Choice B: Let’s Build a Five-Story Pagoda

Sanzang commends your hard work. You say that the tea is delicious and glad this was made. The Sisters agree with you and go eat some dango. Benienma is also there with you. She says that you’ll be blessed by Buddha. Trung Trac asks if the Cons can work as a lookout and they’re capable of it.

**Con:**   
  
Perfect, perfect!    
    
The skies are so close, I can sunbathe all day.    
    
The roof is the best place to relax.  
  
The Trung Sisters want to progress to the next area, but a mist comes forth.  
  
**Guda:**   
  
What’s going on, a weird fog…?    
    
Did it drift from the sea…?  
  
**Trung Trac:**   
  
Be careful, everyone! This is—-!  
  
**Construction 4 Choice C: Let’s Build a Pyramid  
  
The building of the Pyramid is done and it is perfect and is up to the last detail. Da Vinci is slightly disappointed that she doesn’t get to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but doesn’t mind it in the end. The Sisters wonder who it is despite it being Nitocris, but they pet her anyway. Nitocris tells them to stop and says it’s disrespectful. You ask why she’s wearing that and she explains it is to get into the mood of building the Pyramid. She has heard that this building will serve as a watchtower and they are meant to be tall. Nitocris complains and Mashu gets worried, but the Cons don’t mind it and Nitocris allows it. Ereshkigal teases the color of their clothes. The Trung Sisters want to go to the next area but a fog envelops the area.  
  
**Guda:**

A fog envelops the entire island causing Servants and Cons to go frantic. Wu Zetian and Ereshkigal are confused as to this fog.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
  
(What is with this “tremor”...?)    
    
(I don’t have enough data to go in depth with this, but a major anomaly is happening…!)  
  
The Elder recognizes what’s happening, but when he tries to describe it, it’s very vague and he admits he doesn’t remember so it doesn’t help us. The Cons have calmed down thanks to the Trung Sisters.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/ce5mz6m9vks81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e78cf69de280f854ca82d65938b7169dc2930f2)  
  
**Trung Trac:**   
  
This fog is a **precursor for the sea monsters to emerge from beyond the sea.**    
    
This has happened countless times.    
    
Everytime the fog drifts in from beyond the sea, new sea monsters appear on this island and devour the Cons and steal from this place.    
    
That’s how it goes around here.  
  
Trung Nhi noticed from the watchtower that the fog drifted in from the north and the north coastline is closest to the village so they hurried to the coastline with some Cons. You arrive at the beach to notice a frog-like sea monster there, thus you begin to fight it like a regular battle.

**==ARROW==**  
  
You defeat one of them and think that they seemed pretty easy, but Trung Trac notices more up ahead. Wu Zetian notices that the enemies are building some sort of dam with piles of rock and wood. You head over to them to defeat them.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/4b931ecfvks81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=4266eb5341ae1a8f79944f7eb6cf731753103f77)

The Trung Sisters seem to be having a tough time with the frog-like sea monster since Trung Nhi feels that they were significantly different from earlier. Ereshkigal seems to think that they have some kind of conceptual blessing among them or increased strength under certain conditions.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/8bjdjwagvks81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3100c90dd5e2ac193603220bec7a158b6932cfa)  
  
Da Vinci has an informant that can provide information about the monster. Who appears on the transmission is Anastasia Summer. Anastasia was getting prepared to go to a tropical island with you in hopes that Viy would get a friend, but you didn’t call for her so she’s mad at you. Anastasia went out of her way to write down potential pranks that she could do in her notebook for when they arrive. She comes to the conclusion that the sea monster that you’re facing is a **Vodyanoy**.   
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/n1wau1pgvks81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=e76a2f3770645eb37417159f70bb8355a111c4d7)  
  
**Anastasia:**   
  
I suppose that what’s relevant now is that “Vodyanoy prefers to be near water gates and water wheels”, I think?    
    
I don’t remember the meaning and reasoning behind that. That’s just how it’s told.  
  
Ereshkigal connects two and two together to come to the conclusion that what the Vodyanoys are building is similar to a water gate. Da Vinci states that maybe if you break that watergate, then their conceptual blessing will disappear. Lambda decides to use her Noble Phantasm to destroy it in order to easily defeat them.   
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/wbj92qchvks81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=79855465c97374eb2eccdbade4f294e1f735508b)  
  
You defeat them, but Trung Trac states that the fog has not subsided and concludes that this isn’t the end. She continues that the fog may continue to exist for a while, but there are times where it’ll come back with the fog being thinner or thicker. Now the problem becomes about frequent attacks when the fog shows up and the attacks are in different locations. Da Vinci concludes that what we need is a Defensive Transportation System.

Shi Huang Di appears on screen saying that while he isn’t interested in saving the island since it is not his kingdom, he proposes this island’s version of the Great Wall of China since the Great Wall of China can act as defense and a mode of transportation as well.

Thomas Edison arrives and has heard the situation which annoys Shi Huang Di. Edison tells Shi Huang Di that while they do have different ideologies, but when it’s about engineering, he cannot back down. Therefore, he proposes a train network which doesn’t require you to do anything but to get on and relax as the motor vehicle will take you to your destination in no time. He also adds a bonus that the train can carry supplies if needed.

Odysseus arrives and has heard the situation as well. He states that as a leader, he must give advice in any way possible. He says that more options give birth to more detailed strategies. He proposes a Trojan Horse and adds that it’ll be mobile and fast.

**Trung Trac:**   
  
Contact from the watchtower—    
    
Vodyanoy landing at Operation Section 7 District B, Watergate under construction!  
  
Ereshkigal complains about Shi Huang Shi taking credit when he’s not even the one that built it. Trung Trac doesn’t have any complaints about it since she can move more smoothly now and the wall acts as a barrier. Trung Nhi is also curious about Shi Huang Di himself.   
  
Boudica is here to assist you in carrying you around the Great Wall of China. Da Vinci notes that there are too many problems with the Great Wall. You go on Red Hare as he takes you to the location. Red Hare scares Trung Nhi and Boudica snaps at Red Hare. You arrive at your destination to defeat the Vodyanoys.  
  
  
  
  
**Construction 5 Choice B: Let’s Build a Railway

**Trung Trac:**   
  
Contact from the watchtower—    
    
Vodyanoy landing at Operation Section 7 District B, Watergate under construction!  
  
You board the train and Edison is there to tell you to leave it to him to monitor and manage everything here. Although it is one car at the moment, Edison would like to upgrade it to multiple cars. Edison does a final check on the engine and stuff and starts departing and you guys start to relax on the train. The Sisters are fascinated and impressed by such a mode of transportation while the Cons are having fun exploring the train itself. You talk about how eating tangerine is a must on a train, but you don’t know the reason for it which Trung Nhi finds a bit weird. Edison says that it’s unfortunate that while the train’s role is to transport people quickly to their destination, that would also mean being able to relax for just a short while, which Edison is trying to solve right now. We get off and fight the Vodyanoys.

**Trung Trac:**   
  
Contact from the watchtower—

Odysseus has prepared the Trojan Horse to be fully operational, so you go in. The Sister thinks it looks cute. Ereshkigal asks if it’s supposed to be strong. Odysseus replies that while the Trojan Horse on the island resembles his Noble Phantasm, it doesn’t mimic its strength and while its mobility is inferior to that of a horse, its job is to catapult them to the desired location and approach them on foot at high speeds. Da Vinci also compliments it. You arrive at the destination and start beating Yodyanoys up.

Several places have liberated the Vodyanoys and restored previously eaten Cons. The mist subsides and the wave of monsters diminish temporarily which you take this as progress with the help of the construction work. Da Vinci suggests that you all take a break before recapturing the next area.

Trung Nhi is in a forest near the village looking around for something when she doesn’t see anything. She decides to rest for a bit, but a Con asks if she wants company and she decides to play with them. She also gets on a slide with them which she embarrassingly admits is too old for her.

You spot her. She explains that while she does have a serious appearance on the outside, she used to love playing around and that side of her was brought back due to the Cons. However, her playful attitude came to an end when she had to protect her sister during the rebellion and her sister became queen. Trung Nhi did some dirty work to protect her sister which she didn’t like, but was necessary. She says that she’s content with telling you this since you’ve assisting with this island and the Sisters.

**Morgan:**   
  
A Con led me here… What is this place?  
  
**Trung Nhi:**   
  
Woah. Who are you?  
  
**Morgan:**   
  
I am Chaldea’s Servant. More or less. No need to be on guard, girl.  
  
**Trung Nhi:**   
  
(There’s still more of them out there, huh…)    
    
Well, what do you want?  
  
**Morgan:**   
  
It’s not like I have any business here.    
    
I started going along with them and started loving the Cons… No, I heal…no, I observed them…    
    
—Wait. What are those toys that the Cons are using?    
    
Simple appearance, yet rare inventiveness. Exquisitely scary and fun.  
  
**Trung Nhi:**   
  
Do you mean the stilts?  
  
**Morgan:**   
  
I see, that. I shall take note of this information. I see…I see…    
    
Small bobbing legs are truly picturesque. That is a shoe above anything else.    
    
This shall be a fine motivation for those who struggle with new innovations. But before that, we must measure its safety.    
    
Fortunately for you, I am free at the moment. I shall allow you to present something before the queen.  
  
**Trung Nhi:**   
  
(Are you saying you want me to build special stilts for you to use? …You want to ride one?)

Da Vinci says that it is time to conquer the third area. You guys head to the area and Ereshkigal is surprised that there’s no metaphor or tricks to it. It is actually a sea monster horse. Da Vinci and Mashu state that it is a Kelpie, a water monster within the Scottish region and takes on the form of a horse and a bird. Mashu closes it off with the horse eating anyone that dares comes close to it.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/bjh4lchaass81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=7033c9406a32d08ac573c7435c71038070221496)  
  
The Cons are going towards the horse wanting to ride it, but in actuality they’re being eaten by the horse. Lambda stops her number one fan from being eaten as well. Da Vinci notes that Kelpie draws in their pretty through some kind of hypnosis of people trying to ride it. According to legend, if you get onto a Kelpie, you’ll never be able to get off of it. You retreat back to the village to think of a strategy to defeat this sea monster.  
  
Back at the village, Da Vinci says that Cons like to ride something and assume this is something that they were born with. Nhi says that they enjoy using stilts and the Elder mentions that they loved riding on the back of his shell. Da Vinci proposes that they should build a cooler ride so that they won’t be persuaded to think that riding a horse is better than what they’re going to make for the Cons, so they decide to build transportation for the Cons.

Carmilla emerges and says that it doesn’t matter what you guys build as long as it mimics the horse. She makes the analogy that if you were a thief and you saw something that made you excited and thrilled that you’d have it, you’d take it. Voyager says that it’s almost like a Super Car.

Europa emerges and proposes a cow. Parvati agrees and says that they are simple and divine at the same time. She continues to say that while it is difficult to make a real cow, you’ll just have to go with a mechanical cow.

You also think about other modes of transportation which makes you think of Gilgamesh and Arjuna Alter. You say that there are other mysterious modes of transportation like flying. With that, you choose which mode of transportation the Cons will take.

Construction 6 Choice A: Let’s Ride a Super Car  
  
Mashu states that cars don’t really fit with the jungle terrain. Carmilla has given every Con a mini Super Car. Carmilla says that there’s unfortunately a lot of water areas so it’s hard for them to turn and such. If it were her driving her own car, she’d knock down all the trees, but says that she should’ve made it more aquatic. This makes the Kelpie confused and works successfully and Carmilla concludes that the Super Cars are cool and stylish and says that who’d choose a cow over a car.   
  
Construction 6 Choice B: Let’s Ride a Mechanical Bull  
  
  
Europa tells them to go and be careful and the Cons enjoy it very much which makes Parvati and Europa very delighted to see and hear that. Parvati says that bulls are a symbol of strength, grace and endurance. Parvati mentions how bulls are mentioned all over the world like with Iskandar. Wu mentions Nezha, Taigong along with the five-colored divine bull. The Sisters think about how cute the bulls are and think about elephants and how they’re also similar to bulls. You seem to confuse the Kelpie and the Cons can now deal the final blow.

Construction 6 Choice C: Let’s Ride a Vimana  
  
Trung Trac asks what kind of vehicle it is and you reply that it is a Vimana. Trung Nhi still doesn’t get it and you reply that it’s a work of mystery. Da Vinci says that this is an imitation and works very differently to the original, but a certain person wouldn’t allow it.  
  
Da Vinci had other Servants do a rush job for this Vimana which included Tesla and Moriarty who retired halfway. The downside to this vehicle is that it can’t fly up that high since it's set at a certain elevation and can go horizontally. The Cons fly around the Kelpie showing it that it won’t be drawn in by the sea monster and are capable of finishing it off.

## Chapter 11 - Third Area Recapture Battle  
  
  
  
Just kill the Kelpie. Kill it. KILL IT.  
  
**==ARROW==**  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/w1m23d3orss81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=bee6203176443700a2b21e1c1d55e01093def2f1)  
  
Chaldean forces have successfully conquered the third area, giving themselves a small period of relaxation.    
    
I shall take this opportunity to restate this—    
    
I think that the greatest concern and the center of all of this is “them”.    
    
This does not mean anything nor am I going to tell this to anyone, this is a simple thought exercise.  
  
**???:**  
  
(I mean I do have free time. Killing time is just doing meaningless stuff.)  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/0xsmzxmorss81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=0324a82fcb26e03d8b0919949a266839ade26273)  
  
They are called Cons.    
    
There is no…individual difference to them, extremely hard to differentiate and they, currently, don’t possess any names.    
    
A few of them seem to exhibit individualistic traits. Their numbers do not extend that far.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/atprp12prss81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d0ac23c09c69958a35106800ad985e9b672934c)  
  
They have high “intellect” and understand speech. Their knowledge about certain things seem to deviate.    
    
However, I think that it is likely that roughly all Cons understand the current situation.    
    
From that, I will guess that they have some kind of “hivemind intelligence”.    
    
It is unknown whether this is all done consciously or unconsciously.    
    
In the case that it is unconscious, it would seem to suggest that they have some sort of “Unified Conscious”. Additionally, it might serve as a fundamental component of how we perceive the Con Species, but we shall digress from that for now.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/0kvewhpprss81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=8637d745c223c2bd6598d11448e5b024ae753d2a)  
  
Their personality. Some differ among others, but Cons are ordinarily gentle, very curious and innocent.    
    
Every one of them seems to enjoy basking in the sun and playing.    
    
They seem to hate…being eaten?    
    
It is a natural ideology for sentient life.    
    
They possess the will to fight for themselves and their friends.    
    
This is also a natural disposition.    
    
Next is their physical appearance—  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/4bb9x2zprss81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=98a48e06a22b8522513fa0f6c84e5c40faf422e9)  
  
…That’s right. Cons eaten by sea monsters can be revived if Cons themselves deal the finishing blow to the sea monsters.    
    
(It is unclear whether self-identity is preserved, but this is not through any known magecraft)    
    
Apart from this, the Cons are undergoing “spontaneous generation” on this island.    
    
In doing as such…it seems that they’re emerging from the ground.    
    
They are an extension of this planet. Spirits have many variations of their origins.    
    
Though this incident is not particularly strange in any way.    
    
…My intuition tells me that they are not a spirit or a faerie.    
    
In that case, are they related to plants since they develop from the underground? Or like fungus?  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/tr9d8djrrss81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbc426652072ceaac7eef0108b911dead0e97cb0)  
  
I have encountered them countless times and I, still, cannot give a concrete answer.    
    
If I were to make a workshop and lift the ban on every ritual and magecraft, I’d might be able to identify them, but I do not have any motivation to work to that extent.    
    
It is like answering a riddle by casting a charming spell on the player to get information out of them.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/deh1s19srss81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=3db6ecb10565abb431e44c21676193c18e6563d6)  
  
My final conclusions on their physical appearance.    
    
They feel soft, but there is a peculiar response to it. It feels like squishy meat.    
    
Fundamentally, they move leisurely, but keen and nimble when necessary.    
    
Their movements are nimble despite their short arms and legs and they can hold things and use tools as well.    
    
This high learning capability is supported by the aforementioned Unified Conscious.    
    
If all of them were to use “what they’ve learned”, it would appear that they have very strange dexterity.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/7gbu8zlsrss81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=e34a49870bc7a3423afc4bee627edc4a7a085ff6)  
  
Ahh. Their touch. Their weight.    
    
I am sure that they exist right now, but it is clear that they are composed of “something” which is unknown.    
    
Spirits, organisms, life, concepts, will, seed, legend, ideology, conception…    
    
Between these ambiguous divisions and compartments, I am confident that I can sense there is something unspoken.    
    
I suppose if they are ■■■— something repulsively beneficial might occur. But what would it mean?  
  
**???:**  
  
…I shall approve of them. Don’t misunderstand me here.  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/m5750c5trss81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=b18629ca3ae5295e23daf5b3be1b6d425d4090b7)  
  
I can feel something slightly “ominous” from the Cons themselves.    
    
Ominous, but not evil.  
  
**???:**  
  
…  
  
  
  
![image](https://preview.redd.it/l7h25dftrss81.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=af77b35f9b1f8d3509543d30c1f6357bc35ac197)  
  
I can also feel something similar from this world itself.    
    
However, something is tampering it.    
    
At the very root, something is being overlooked.    
    
Those are my impressions. Though—    
    
I have decided that I shall enjoy their touch for now.     
    
I shall say this very bluntly.  
  
**???:**  
  
Fufu.

The village is now populated with Cons that you’ve gathered. Mashu says that roughly over half the island is captured by you. The Elder wants to say something but doesn’t remember, but then he remembers that he wanted to ask the Sisters a favor. Inside the tent, the Sisters start explaining that we have to expand the village once more due to an overpopulation problem with the Cons. Trung Nhi suggests another neighborhood that’s above the water, but you have to consider that Semiramis is doing all the work, so we’re open to suggestions.

Marie Antoinette emerges and proposes a massive ship like a luxury cruise for everyone to live on. Nobunaga pops up and tells us to hold and says that we should, of course, build a houseboat. She continues that it’ll have all the Japanese formal rooms and dishes and if there’s a fire, just jump into the water since there’s exits already available. MHX can’t think of aquatic building, but proposes a colony ship since space is better than water. She adds that there’ll be functions for life in the case the planet dies. Da Vinci is slightly annoyed that they’re coming in and suggesting what they want, but reminds you that you’re the one who’ll decide in the end.

**Construction 7 Choice A: Let’s Live on a Luxury Cruise Ship  
  
Overall, everyone seems to be impressed with the ship since it comes with a lot of rooms for different purposes. Robin Hood is there and Da Vinci compliments that it’s like a hotel with a great deck. Marie Antoinette wants to do a Titanic reference where the man supports the woman from behind while the woman stands at the edge of the deck with both looking at the horizon. However, Kiyohime Summer does not approve of that. A Con jumps off the ship since it seems fun, so they rescue them and Lambda scolds them.

Every GUDAGUDA character is there on the houseboat having a big party. Beniemna is the main cook for the houseboat. Saito Hajime states that the houseboat should’ve had a bit more charm to it and asks why Okita is in swimsuits. She responds that “we’re in a southern country (?)”. The Cons enjoy their time in the houseboat since it has a very fun environment. The Sisters ask if it’s ok to sit down and lie down and you say it is ok. They sit down and start sleeping, which you let them do without interrupting them.

**Construction 7 Choice C: Let’s Live on a Colony Ship  
  
The Trung Sisters are impressed by this unknown technology. Mysterious Heroine X shows the Sisters around and shows them a cockpit and it doesn’t function, it’s just a replica, but she wants to expand it when the time comes which will be next season. The window is just a wallpaper. She sees Cons and puts them out of the way and makes the excuse that she couldn’t afford a weightless machine since it was too expensive. Mysterious Heroine X is curious about the Cons comparing them to aliens. As long as they are not sabers, it is fine. Trung Trac seems to be impressed that the Cons like it and that the ship is wind and water resistant.

Mashu states that after we gave the Cons mounts, weapons and armor, we began to raid the next area. There were new sea monsters in the next area but they had confidence that they could pull through. However, in the end, we retreated back to the village since the new monsters do mental attacks to the Cons. A flashback to the battle, a female spirit sings a song which makes the Cons approach them. Vritra who came to help already succumbed to the attack. Da Vinci managed to tell them to retreat.

Anastasia tells you that the sea monster this time around is called a Rusalka. It's a legend that they lure people in with songs and drag them into the water. She continues to say that they’re like the Vodyanoy’s wife, but she doesn’t know how true it is, but it doesn’t matter.  
  
Lambda’s number one fan comes in and says that while her number one fan was in danger, it managed by knowing that Lambda was more beautiful than her. Lambda is very excited to hear that, but also indicates that if the Cons get to know fun cultures that are better than the Rusalka, then they won’t be succumbed by them.

Nero comes in and says that entertainment was very popular in Rome that she proposes a theater. Tomoe Gozen emerges and proposes a Game Center since a house of electronic entertainment suited for our era which Hinako and Osakabehime agree to. Murasaki Shikibu appears and suggests that there is some fun in reading books so she suggests a Library. Trung Nhi that this is neat and that the decision is up to you.

**Construction Quest 8 Choice A: Let’s Build a Theater  
  
Nero’s theater is complete and says that she would have put on a one man show for everything and says that it is not adequate. So Nero puts on a very spectacular show by making Scheherazade put on an exciting story for the Cons. Everyone seems to enjoy the story that Scheherazade puts on which is just horror and exciting stories. After that, Mata Hari puts on a dance show for everyone. Charlotte Corday is next to put on a magic show for everyone. For the end, Nero concludes everything and Elizabeth puts on a musical which the scene ends with a To Be Continued.  
  
  
**Construction Quest 8 Choice B: Let’s Build a Game Center  
  
  
  
Hinako, Osakabehime and Tomoe Gozen state that there are a variety of games in different genres. Tomoe is shocked that she didn’t account for the size which Hinako demonstrates that the Cons are playing together with one using the levers and one using the buttons. Tomoe will make adjustments later to fit the Con’s size. The Trung Sisters try to play some games, but are more suited with physical games like air hockey. Trung Nhi makes a new record in shooting the goal but she mistakenly tossed a Con which she is extremely sorry for.

**Construction Quest 8 Choice C: Let’s Build a Library  
  
Murasaki Shikibu states that she would have helped with the construction if she had time. The Trung Sisters and the Cons are having fun reading. Jeanne Lily, Jack the Ripper, Paul Bunyan and Nursery Rhyme are also there and having fun with the Cons. Murasaki Shikibu has done some research on the Trung Sisters and is surprised by how much there is about them. The Cons asks Murasaki Shikibu if she has a book for them and says that she has a picture book for them. She is surprised that the book is upside down and is surprised that they’re improvising a new story and doing a read aloud. With this, she’ll be at the counter if you need anything and she is inspired to create something new.  
  
   
  
## Chapter 14 - Fourth Area Recapture Battle  
  
You return back to the area and fight off the Rusalka, but the Cons seem to can’t get the things they’ve enjoyed out of their head which means that they’re resisting the Rusalka’s mental attacks. Lambda states that Cons can’t distinguish between reality and games and tells her number one fan not to be like them since her Con. Lambda continues to tell them to be careful when doing the finishing blow. Trung Trac tells them to give it their all since this is the last area.  
  
**==BATTLE==**  
  
Benkai and Mashu praise them for winning and that this is natural. Da Vinci states that while they’re relaxing and resting, she wants to take this time to review their information. Da Vinci states that this would have been easier if Sherlock Holmes didn’t take a day off from work, but Anastasia says that it’s normal to take a day off. Da Vinci goes over the characteristics and features of the enemies we’ve encountered so far which are the Merman, Hermit Crabs, Bunyips, Vodyanoys and Rusalkas. They conclude that none of them are clues on narrowing down the region. Da Vinci tries to find some significant commonality and outlier between them. Da Vinci shares her opinions, but it is not shared with the reader.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
  
Unfortunately, we can’t draw any conclusions just yet.    
    
However, there’s a possibility that it was the beginning of everything.    
    
That’s right…this anomaly has appeared before us from the very beginning and why I feel like the place is the “Unknown Coordinate Singularity”...

## Chapter 15: Preparation for a Sea Battle  
  
The Sisters begin the meeting to explain that there are isolated areas within the region that have pulled in more water than anywhere in the region. The monsters within these secluded areas are a multitude of fishmen, which isn’t anything special, but they are high in numbers. However, in order to get to these areas, you’ll need a boat with navigation and combat.   
  
Drake, Blackbeard and Bartholomew recommend a pirate ship since it has combat. However the three of them have differing opinions on what kind of ship it’ll be. Mordred wants a hovercraft. Hokusai proposes a utsuro-bune which she was inspired by old books. Trung Trac was dozing off during suggestion time, but it’s always up to you to decide.  
  
**Construction 9 Choice A: Let’s Embark on a Pirate Ship**  
  
Drake is amazed by how smart the Cons are with how they built this ship. Mashu asks what the ship’s name will be and they want to mash up all the names, thus, The Queen Anne’s Golden Royal. Drake says it should be the Golden Royal’s Revenge. Bartholomew says it should be the Royal Anne Hind Mekakure Fortune which Drake cannot believe that there’s someone stupider than Blackbeard himself.  
  
**Construction 9 Choice B: Let’s Embark on a Hovercraft**  
  
Mordred is impressed and says that it’s smoother than surfing. Gareth and Mashu try to calm her down by saying that this is a test run. The Trung Sisters are worried in the end since Artoria Alter (Maid) shot her Noble Phantasm at the Hovercraft and the Hovercraft successfully evaded it.  
  
**Construction 9 Choice C: Let’s Embark on a Utsuro-bune**  
  
Hokusai tells the story of the Utsuro-bune which was a boat that was shaped like a box, with glass overhead and many layers of steel at the very bottom. Da Vinci likes the mystery since Hokusai states that a exotic woman held the mysterious box and that the ship was found in the Edo period. They speculate that the box could be something sentient and Da Vinci ends it off with that the woman never let go of the box and let anybody near or touch it.  
  
People never tried to understand the woman and she was exiled back into the sea. Da Vinci tells Jeanne Alter Lily that mysteries should stay mysteries and Hokusai doesn’t care as long as it appears good for her.  
  
## Chapter 16: Night Before the Decisive Battle  
  
You wake up in the middle of the night to take a walk in the village when you encounter Trung Trac. She says that she couldn’t sleep when she remembers that Servant don’t really need such things, but says that she’s nervous or even scared.  
  
Trung Trac says that she’s constantly remembering her rebellion and the failing result. Everyone who followed her was killed and she feels heavily guilty and compares it to as if she killed her sister. She thought that the Cons were an attempt to redeem herself, but it is not a guarantee that it won’t happen once more so she tried to stay brave in front of everyone despite not being able to convince herself as she questions the throne and how she became one. She calls herself a poor ruler and just a naive girl, but you say that she’s a good leader. You comfort her that she’ll win since she has her sister, the Cons and us. Trung Trac is motivated by your words and will protect them. Meanwhile, Nhi overhears the entire thing and remains quiet.  
  
**???:**  
The original plan of using “them” had to be changed.  
The residents of this fish tank aren’t growing larger and they’re spitting out valuable food    
However, it doesn't matter. There is always the next best option.    
On the contrary, the food itself grew within the fish tank. Food with value cannot be overlooked.    
Even if the original goal can’t be fulfilled…    
All someone has to do is begin the **harvest**—
