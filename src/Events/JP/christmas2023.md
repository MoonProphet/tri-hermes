# Merry Christmas in the Snowy Fields 2023 - 7 Days / 8 Years Snow Carol

## 0. Transporter Santa Claus
  
**Nemo:**  
The Servants will be visiting their homes?  
On the bleached Earth?   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Right. Servants are still children of humanity  
(*save for a few exceptions).   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
It's only natural that they'd miss their places of birth,  
not to mention that returning to their lands has the  
benefit of restoring their damaged Saint Graphs.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Therefore, all Servants who apply for it are given  
leave to return home for seven days every year.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
You can't have summer vacation but no winter  
vacation, can you?   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Well, Chaldea's magical energy supply is minimized,  
so it's not actually as comfortable as it could've been.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Any problems, Captain?   
  
**Nemo:**  
...No, I have no objections as long as they keep in  
touch. I can agree that restoring their Saint Graphs  
would be an improvement to our forces.   
  
**Nemo:**  
It's effective to review and reinput the elements of the  
source character that one loses or forgets.   
  
**Nemo:**  
On the off chance the Border gets attacked,  
we'll have to forcibly summon all of them back,  
causing overload for the Triton Engines...   
  
**Nemo:**  
but not all Servants will apply for visits. I'm sure the  
applicants will be a minority.   
  
**Nemo:**  
At Chaldea's current state, a 10-20% loss of  
personnel is something we can compensate for with  
knowledge and experience.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
&mdash;   
  
**Nemo:**  
Da Vinci?   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Sure, you got the 10-20% number right. You just  
assigned it to the wrong box.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
80% of our Servants are currently visiting their homes.  
The 20% are the ones remaining on the Storm Border.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Don't worry. SHEBA's future observation guarantees  
that we're safe for at least another seven days.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
You can be sure that the Storm Border won't be  
attacked. Professor said the same thing.   
  
**Nemo:**  
Professor... This is the sort of thing you have to report  
to your captain. That's unacceptably negligent...  
Lazy, even.   
  
**Nemo:**  
...I'll deal with my own problems later...   
  
**Nemo:**  
What matters now is the other Servants. We have too  
many Servants absent. That's unreasonable.   
  
**Nemo:**  
Did Chaldea work them so hard that everyone got  
homesick?   
  
**Fou:**  
Fou. Fou.  
(Special translation: They kinda did.)   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
There's one more reason. I know this may sound too  
Chaldea-esque for your standards, but&ndash;   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
we have a regular tradition of a Santa delivering  
presents to everyone on Christmas.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Many might be waiting at home in hopes of getting  
what they wished for.   
  
**Nemo:**  
These people are crazy. Eels who've tied themselves  
in knots.   
  
**Nemo:**  
Christmas? Santa Claus? While the Earth is bleached?   
  
**Nemo:**  
It's deplorable to see Leonardo da Vinci making such  
an elementary mistake.   
  
**Nemo:**  
“Waiting at home” is not even the point!   
  
**Nemo:**  
“Needing to be good the whole year” is! Not making it  
about that removes most of the joy of the season!   
  
**???:**  
Yes! That's exactly it! Christmas is proof that you did  
good this year!   
  
**???:**  
I can see why the kids want to be like you,  
adventurous captain Nemo! You know what really  
matters about Christmas!   
  
**Santa Martha:**  
I've been thinking that it's about time I chose someone  
for this year's Santa role. But there were too many  
candidates on the list~!   
  
**Santa Martha:**  
Preferably, I'd want a sturdy and hardworking Rider  
Class Servant!   
  
**Santa Martha:**  
And now fortune smiled my way right when I needed  
it!   
  
**Santa Martha:**  
Rider Class? Check!  
Hardworking? 100%! Sturdy? Tarasque level!   
  
**Santa Martha:**  
Perfect. The Lord's guidance has brought us together.   
  
**Santa Martha:**  
Greetings and good day, Heroic Spirit Nemo.   
  
**Santa Martha:**  
May I ask you to be this year's Santa?   
  
**Nemo:**  
Me, the Santa? Wait, does that just pass down from  
one to the other so casually?   
  
**Santa Martha:**  
Yes, the Santa Claus is chosen by the previous one  
every year!   
  
**Santa Martha:**  
I was an exception, but I hear this pattern was true for  
mostly all other Santas!   
  
**Nemo:**  
I-If you say so.   
  
**Nemo:**  
But I am a conqueror of the seas, not someone known  
for giving children things they want.   
  
**Nemo:**  
Not to mention I have my tasks as captain.   
  
**Santa Martha:**  
Oh, I see. Hmm, then I suppose I'll have to ask  
someone else.   
  
**Santa Martha:**  
Sorry for the sudden and unreasonable request.  
I'll go look for another Santa candidate to&ndash;   
  
**E：Nemo Baker=spot:**  
HOLD IT! It's Santa we're talking about! Delivering  
presents!   
  
**E：Nemo Baker=spot:**  
We have do it! Let us do it, Captain!  
It's guaranteed to be fuuuuun!   
  
**Nemo Marine=spot:**  
Agreed! We wanna be Santaaaaaa!   
  
**Nemo Engineer=spot:**  
H-hmpf. Christmas, eh? Might be a good idea to leave  
the Storm Border coolin' off.   
  
**Nemo Professor=spot:**  
This is my moment. In preparation for this occasion,  
I converted the Nautilus' landing vessel into a  
four-by-fo~ur.   
  
**I：Nemo Nurse=spot:**  
I have no reason to object. Since there will be no  
combat, I'll have no work to do at the infirmary.   
  
**I：Nemo Nurse=spot:**  
Besides, I'm sure our wise Captain already thought of  
what he wanted to do as soon as the word “Santa”  
entered the conversation.   
  
**Santa Martha:**  
Sorry for the sudden and unreasonable request.  
I'll go look for another Santa candidate to&ndash;   
  
**Nemo:**  
I accept, of course. Fortunately, Da Vinci told me  
everything about it.   
  
**C：Fou (Narration):**  
“Nemo's train of thought there lasted 0.5 seconds.  
This level is comparable to the average Atlas  
alchemist's Thought Acceleration.”   
  
**Santa Martha:**  
Great. Then I'll pass the Santa Saint Graph to you.   
  
**Santa Martha:**  
Close your eyes and focus on your personal idea of  
Santa Claus.   
  
**Santa Martha:**  
It's a very difficult and time-consuming process,  
but I'm sure the great Captain Nemo can&ndash;HUH?!   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
This is a good enough look for a Santa Claus.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Thank you for choosing me, Saint Martha. I will not  
disappoint.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I am now Captain, yet not Captain.  
The leader of Team Nautilus, Nemo Porter!   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Discipline to the naughty children.  
Presents to the nice children.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Leave it to me. I never fail an assignment. I swear on  
the name of the Heroic Spirit Nemo that Santa will not  
allow failure!   
  
**Santa Martha:**  
(Whaaat? Did I choose the wrong person?)   
  
**--ARROW--**
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
A Santa Claus Mystic Code!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Yes, this is Da Vinci's end-of-year special allowance  
for you!   
  
**Mash:**  
A warm suit for a Christmas veteran like you to hit the  
town with...   
  
**Mash:**  
This Christmas is a success already. It would be no  
exaggeration to say you're the best Santa of the  
century.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Am I? (Trying not to look too happy)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I sure am. (Shit-eating grin)  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
Sorry to spoil your Santa Mystic Code fun, but you  
won't need to head out, Master.   
  
**???:**  
Save the costume for the Christmas party. Or for next  
year's gift delivery.   
  
**Mash:**  
Oh! I know that voice&mdash;   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Merry Christmas, Mash and Fujimaru.  
As you can see, I'm this year's Santa.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I don't have any witty name for this form, so let's  
stick with the plain and simple Nemo Santa.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Alternatively, Nemo Porter, since my standard  
function is delivering requested packages.   
  
**Mash:**  
&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
&mdash;  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
So I'm Nemo Santa. Any problems?   
  
**Mash:**  
N-no, the red cap looks great on you. And your  
moustache is...yes.   
  
**Mash:**  
It's a dignified mustachio, an honor to Captain Nemo's  
legacy... Is it a disguise piece?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(Nodding a "Yeah, yeah")  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Less of a disguise piece and more an expression of  
how I feel. I thought my body and spirit needed some  
facial hair while I'm in Santa mode.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
No, forget what you just heard. Some things are best  
left unsaid. I only passed by to say goodbye before  
departing.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
It turns out Santa Claus has a Skill that picks up on  
people's wishes for his arrival.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
So I opened a support ticket for each request and now  
the task list has over 300 tickets.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
And the Servants are currently spread all around the  
world.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
That's more hard work than you two can handle.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
As your captain, no, as your Santa, I can't exploit your  
labor after you've been nice kids the whole year.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I can handle this year's Christmas alone&mdash;  
or rather, with the crew.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Unlike other Santas, I have a 4x4, a computer that can  
tell me the most efficient present delivery route,   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
and an anchor hook that can get me into anywhere.  
Trust me, the delivery process will be over in a cinch  
with my cutting-edge equipment.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Do not follow me out there. Are we clear on that?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Alright... I can wrap this up in seven days. I'll be  
reporting to you at the end of each day.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
So you just relax and enjoy your winter vacation with  
Mash. Resting is an essential part of a Master's duty.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Copy that? You two have a cake ready in Chaldea for  
when I'm back.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
The shop and item exchange will be operational,  
of course. I understand the exchanging shop is the  
star atop your Christmas tree.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Nemo Porter is the perfect Santa. Absolutely flawless,  
you could say.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Bye then. Merry Christmas.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
&mdash;HUH!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Sorry, the moustache's impact got to me and I didn't hear a word...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Indeed... I also don't know how to comment on his  
manliness...   
  
**Mash:**  
Now that I've had time to collect myself and feel more  
assured... I'm grateful that Captain Nemo became  
Santa, but I feel like things could've been different...   
  
**BB:**  
I know, right? I was totally ROBBED!   
  
**BB:**  
I wasn't counting on Nemo to take the Santa Saint  
Graph first...   
  
**BB:**  
(Sniff) What am I supposed to say to the Senpais all  
over the world who patiently waited with faith that this  
year would be the year of BB Santa...?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
BB!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
No faith here whatsoever!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
BB!? When did you get here?   
  
**Mash:**  
Also, my apprehensions weren't about who gets to  
have the Santa Saint Graph...   
  
**BB:**  
Yes, I know. It was just a little quip of BB humor.   
  
**BB:**  
Your problem is with Nemo Porter's work policies.   
  
**BB:**  
The “I don't need anyone else to deliver the Christmas  
presents” part, right, Mash?   
  
**Mash:**  
Yes. I believe that's too much even for Nemo,  
considering that all the Servants are in their lands of  
choice for Christmas...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
They all just do whatever they want...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I think Nemo can handle it, but...  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I wanna help. And not because of the Santa Mystic Code.  
  
---  
  
**BB:**  
...   
  
**Mash:**  
I agree. I'd love to go after him and offer our help right  
now...   
  
**Mash:**  
But Nemo has other plans, so I don't believe he'd be  
happy about it...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
True...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Captain Nemo is a guy who values discipline over kindness...  
  
---  
  
**BB:**  
Then approach it from a different angle.   
  
**BB:**  
Nemo Porter only told you not to follow him.   
  
**BB:**  
He never said you can't do any Santa work. Soooo...   
  
**BB:**  
If you really want to take any part in this operation,  
I have a few ideas.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Like what?  
  
---  
  
**BB:**  
How about making his route safer?   
  
**BB:**  
Nemo Santa said his delivery schedule will last seven  
days, meaning his route is split into seven areas.   
  
**BB:**  
There will be obstacles and enemies along the way,  
and taking each of them down will be exhausting even  
for Santa Claus.   
  
**BB:**  
That's where you come in&mdash;   
  
**Mash:**  
We'll traverse the routes before he does and remove  
the obstacles!   
  
**Mash:**  
I agree that this would qualify as both a separate  
activity and be helpful to Nemo!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Well said, Mash! Christmas is sure to have traffic jams.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Infrastructure improvements are always nice!  
  
---  
  
**BB:**  
Are we settled? Then I'm going to get informed on  
the area division.   
  
**BB:**  
Knowing Nemo Santa's personality, the routes will be  
the ones most efficient and to-the-point.   
  
**BB:**  
I'll calculate it in a snap and get there ahead of  
everyone to set missions for you to clean up♡   
  
**BB:**  
Oh right, the Earth is bleached so the snow-piled  
roads are actually sand! You can't ask for a winter  
more Chaldean than that!   
  
**BB:**  
BB does LOVE seeing a Senpai working [♂ himself /♀️ herself] to the  
bone on the holiday season!   
  
**Mash:**  
Thank you for the advice and mission drafting, BB!   
  
**Mash:**  
Let's go, Master! We'll be the light on Nemo Santa's  
path!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
OK! It's Christmassing time!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Leave it to me! Nemo Santa's road will be free and clear!  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
&mdash;By the way,  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
why are you doing this, BB?  
  
---  
  
**BB:**  
Hmm. Good question...   
  
**BB:**  
Partly frustration that I failed to claim the Santa Saint  
Graph, but mainly that it sucks that I haven't been  
getting any significant screen time lately...   
  
**BB:**  
Well, also a special sympathy toward the Heroic Spirit  
Nemo! We share the Imaginary Numbers element!   
  
**BB:**  
I'll help getting you to the designated areas.  
My Zero Shift isn't the most refined, but I find it's  
better than going on foot.   
  
**BB:**  
Well then, let's begin Operation: Holiday Season  
Route Maintenance.   
  
**BB:**  
These seven long days will pass in a flash.  
Do your best every day, Senpai♡   
  
## Day 1
  
**Narration:**
- 6:00 PM -  
- End of business hours -   
  
**Mash:**  
Thanks to BB's Zero Shift, we managed to get back  
with time to spare.   
  
**Mash:**  
Today's business should come to an end right this  
minute...   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Yoo-hoo, coming iiiin! Team Nautilus completed  
today's deliveries!   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Look, Master! Don't I look awesome in my Santa suit?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Behave, Marine.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I only brought you along to stop your pestering.  
If you're going to make a ruckus, you're not joining  
next time.   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Aye-aye, sir! Shutting up now!   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
I just wanted to show off the new outfit we Marines  
are wearing. The rest's up to you, Captain&mdash;   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
&mdash;sorry! “Leader”.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Geez... I'm going to need to bring Baker and the rest  
along to keep a leash on things.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Whatever, I'll just watch how things unfold.  
I'm back, Fujimaru and Mash.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
As promised, I'm dropping by to report after  
concluding today's delivery.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Welcome home, Nemo Santa.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Excellent job today.  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
The first day was an warm-up, with a present count  
on the lower end. It was an easy delivery.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
It's tomorrow that I'll first buckle down for this Santa  
business. Oh, but...   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Today's last delivery was memorable.  
Also, there's a present addressed to you.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Do you want to know who it's from?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Of course.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Who could it be...?  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Alright. Long story short, the last location I visited  
today was&mdash;   
  
**--BATTLE--**
  
**Anning:**  
Hoh? Look who it is. Nemo! What brings you here?  
Felt like visiting my place?   
  
**Anning:**  
Be my guest. I'ma go brew you some coffee!   
  
**Anning:**  
Ya know, I've always felt this special affinity for you,  
Nemo. I mean, a nautilus is almost a belemnite,  
am I right?   
  
**Anning:**  
Surely you've battled a living prehistoric monster  
under the deep seas.   
  
**Anning:**  
Might've even seen a pterosaur in the flesh.  
Come sip some tea with me as we watch the Lyme  
Regis coastline.   
  
**Anning:**  
Although that place is an empty land covered in snow  
now, so we won't be able to see the ocean or the shore!   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I'm sorry about that. It might be me that's the cause  
of the snow.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Merry Christmas, Mary Anning. I know it's early,  
but I'm here to deliver your present.   
  
**Anning:**  
Huh? Christmas? You're working as Santa, mister?   
  
**Anning:**  
Hell, you didn't ride here on the Nautilus? Then I want  
nothing from you. Bugger off.   
  
**Anning:**  
'Sides, I don't trust “Santa”, “Christmas”, or any other  
of these transparent acts of goodwill.   
  
**Anning:**  
Society's about give and take. Trading. I'll have ya  
know I'm a capable merchant.   
  
**Anning:**  
I may love me some cash, but I'm not brave enough to  
accept a gift given for no reason.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
There is a reason. Santa makes his presents in  
response to calls for them. You wanted me here.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Your name is clearly listed in the list of the wishful.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I'm here for your delivery. As Santa Claus.   
  
**Anning:**  
Hoho. You're saying this box has what I want?   
  
**Anning:**  
Say what it is. If it really is what I want, I'll take it.   
  
**Anning:**  
Well, I already gave you the answer out loud!  
I know what you're thinking, you can't hide it.   
  
**Anning:**  
“Mary Anning is a barbaric fossil digger and a  
merchant who only cares 'bout money”!   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I can't disagree. You're very levelheaded about your  
finances, but I didn't bring you cash.   
  
**Anning:**  
Ah! Doggy clothes, the #1 ego boost item for smug  
pet owners...!   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
That's what the list said. But I don't think this is about  
the owner's unflinching ego.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Nothing pleases a loyal dog more than seeing the joy  
on their owner's face.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
If you believe your dog looks precious in these clothes,  
your happiness will make your dog happy, don't you  
agree?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Besides, these clothes are very resilient. They  
shouldn't tear in case of a landslide.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
This is what you wished for. If you don't want it,  
I'll take it back.   
  
**Anning:**  
Cripes, I want it! Nemo, are you an angel!?   
  
**Anning:**  
But ain't this Santa business bloody awful!?  
You walk through all that snow to deliver gifts and not  
get paid for it?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
That's how Santa Claus is. But your case is an  
exception.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Mary Anning, there is a reason why I chose you to be  
the last visit of the day.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Would you tell me your stories as a digger who never  
failed to excavate precious fossils?   
  
**Anning:**  
Blimey, you couldn't ask for a better sweetener!  
How could I say no to someone asking me to regale  
the saga of my glory?   
  
**Anning:**  
Do you wanna hear about my debut excavation,  
the ichthyosaurus? Or do you prefer my most major  
work, the plesiosaurus?   
  
**Anning:**  
Ask for any story you like! I could even teach you how  
to excavate fossils!   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
And that's what happened. Anning is a much more  
eloquent talker than she initially seems.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
It sounded like she could go on for hours still,  
but she knew exactly when to wrap things up.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
And then she gave me a present.   
  
**Anning:**  
So, uh...can you take this?   
  
**Anning:**  
Now that I'm home, I got to relax and polish fossils...  
I can hope one'll work as a good luck charm.   
  
**Anning:**  
It feels bad not to give anything in return. Merchant's  
pride.   
  
**Anning:**  
There's one for you and one for Master. To tell you  
the truth, one of them was actually for me!   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I see. You returned home in order to give this to  
Master.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Thank you, Anning. I'll gladly accept it.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
This belemnite fossil does indeed resemble a nautilus.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
A good luck charm from Anning...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(Thank you, Anning.)  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
That's all from me. I'd better rest. My day starts early  
tomorrow.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Master, today proved that I can handle the present  
delivery on my own.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
It bears repeating: do not follow Santa. Are we clear?   
  
## Day 2
  
**Narration:**
- 6:00 PM -  
- End of business hours -   
  
**Mash:**  
Once again, we made the route as safe as possible.  
We've been quite efficient, wouldn't you agree?   
  
**Mash:**  
By the way, Senpai, have you already been to the  
event currency shop?   
  
**Mash:**  
It's a very lively place, since it's operated by the  
Marines that stayed behind in the Border's moorage.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
I'm glad to hear positive reviews of the event shop.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
There were concerns the Marines would be getting  
into trouble.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Nurse!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
The Santa hat looks great on you!  
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
Doesn't it? I really like how it's the same model as  
Miss Nightingale.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
Thank Saint Martha for choosing us for the Santa  
position... Oh, I forgot the important part.   
  
---  
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
Good day, Fujimaru and Mash.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
I'm visiting because I still hadn't given you my formal  
greetings.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
And naturally, I'm accompanying our Leader.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Sorry for the unannounced visit. I trust that you  
wouldn't do anything unnecessary, but I'll ask anyways.  
Did you have a quiet, enjoyable day?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Y-yeah, I've been relaxing in my bedroom.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
N-nothing unusual happened.  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I'd hope so.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
Leader, I don't agree with demanding them to spend  
all of Christmas in their rooms.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
Why not let them have a safe, injury-free adventure in  
the simulator?   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
Oh, we finished delivering to the England-France  
region after getting a start on that yesterday.  
Here's the ticket list.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
Also, here's a present from Habetrot to the both of  
you.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
I believe it's a set of warmers to match with your  
Santa outfit.   
  
**Mash:**  
Thank you. So today you visited Habetrot?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Yes. She requested me to say hi to you. And she was  
with unexpected company&ndash;   
  
**--BATTLE--**
  
**Britomart:**  
My apologies! I didn't realize you were Santa Claus!   
  
**Britomart:**  
When I saw everything suddenly get covered in snow,  
I assumed it was the work of a wicked magician and  
engaged in full-force combat!   
  
**Britomart:**  
I should have associated the snow with Christmas and  
the red cap and sled combo with Santa...   
  
**Britomart:**  
Blame it all on Britomart, you didn't deserve any  
suspicion.   
  
**Britomart:**  
Err, I know this is rich coming from me, but are you  
hurt!?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
No problem.  
As you can see, I'm a professional Santa.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Our schedule accounts for the possibility of some  
skirmishes. One in every three visits has us mistaken for  
an invader.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
But it was a surprise to see you here. Is this address  
your homeland, Habetrot?   
  
**Habetrot:**  
Yeah, you came to the right place! Britain is our  
birthplace!   
  
**Habetrot:**  
Britomart and Oberon are from the same place as me,  
so I invited the two over for a little tea party.   
  
**Habetrot:**  
We're chatting about Morgan! Britomart is always  
wanting to know more about her, see?   
  
**Habetrot:**  
So she came to hear from Morgan's tea buddy  
Habetrot and the self-proclaimed Morgan expert  
Oberon!   
  
**Oberon:**  
That's right. I heard she'd have some nice snacks to  
eat, so I took this fine opportunity to visit.   
  
**Oberon:**  
As for the Morgan talk, I'm sticking only to the  
harmless, safe-to-speak parts. Don't want to shatter  
her dreams, eh?   
  
**Oberon:**  
Besides, I may know a lot about Fairy Britain,  
but I never got a chance to see the real Britain before.   
  
**Oberon:**  
I'm arguably a Pan-Human fairy. No harm in taking a  
look with my own eyes.   
  
**Oberon:**  
That said, there's nothing to see here, no thanks to  
the bleaching! Hahaha!   
  
**Britomart:**  
It's mortifying, really... If I was at least as developed  
as my mother, I could deploy a temporary fairyland,   
  
**Britomart:**  
allowing King Oberon to see the beauty of the original  
Britain...   
  
**Oberon:**  
Don't bother yourself for my sake, Britomart.  
Raise your chin. Dejection doesn't suit a fairy's face.   
  
**Oberon:**  
I can intuit how beautiful the land was just by looking  
at you.   
  
**Oberon:**  
There's no need to see the real thing,   
  
**Oberon:**  
which means I can simply wait for a better  
opportunity in the future, no?   
  
**Britomart:**  
&mdash;!   
  
**G：Nemo Santa:**  
(The moment she fell to her knees, he took  
Britomart's hand so naturally!)   
  
**Habetrot:**  
(Uh-huh. Taking her hand is an understatement.  
He smoothly rose her back to her feet when his  
“better opportunity” came.)   
  
**Oberon:**  
So? Is Santa Claus here to give Habetrot something?   
  
**B：Nemo Santa:**  
Yes. My business is with Habetrot. All of you being  
here too was unexpected.   
  
**B：Nemo Santa:**  
What she wants is marked as personal.  
May I ask you to relocate?   
  
**Habetrot:**  
Hm? What, am I the only one getting a present?  
What about Oberon and Britomart?   
  
**B：Nemo Santa:**  
The two of them are not on the checklist. It must  
mean they don't have anything they want at the  
moment.   
  
**Britomart:**  
Correct! I'm still in training! I'm saving the wishing for  
when I'm fully qualified!   
  
**Oberon:**  
It's the other way around here. I have too many things  
I want.   
  
**Oberon:**  
I suppose I'm off the list because there's no one  
present option I could settle on.   
  
**Britomart:**  
I see... Then if we have countless Christmases,  
you'll eventually get your wish granted, King Oberon!   
  
**Oberon:**  
&mdash;   
  
**Oberon:**  
True. With countless wants, one at least has a good  
chance of coming true.   
  
**I：Nemo Santa:**  
The bystanders are away now.  
Then this is for you, Habetrot. Merry Christmas.   
  
**Habetrot:**  
Thank you, Santa Claus. Can I open it right away?   
  
**I：Nemo Santa:**  
Be my guest. Verify if it really is what you want.  
Hearing you got the wrong thing would harm my  
Santa credentials.   
  
**Habetrot:**  
Then don't mind if I do...   
  
**Habetrot:**  
...!   
  
**I：Nemo Santa:**  
Was that the right thing?   
  
**Habetrot:**  
Yup! This is what I wanted! You know how I'm the  
yarn-spinning fairy of the spinning wheel?   
  
**Habetrot:**  
My lips often get inflamed thanks to all that  
thread-licking. That's what this balm is for. It'll prove a  
helpful work tool.   
  
**Habetrot:**  
But...it's also make-up, kinda. Though I'm still far off  
from becoming a bride.   
  
**I：Nemo Santa:**  
You're not that far. You'd be wasting the make-up  
part if you use it in your alone time instead of flaunting  
it.   
  
**Habetrot:**  
R-really? Won't people laugh at me?   
  
**I：Nemo Santa:**  
Absolutely not. You'll look great. You have Santa's  
seal of approval.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
I can't go into further detail on what her present was,  
but that's the general gist of the situation.   
  
**Mash:**  
So Habetrot went off to her homeland.   
  
**Mash:**  
Oberon and Britomart are also English heroes,  
so I trust that they could have a stimulating chat.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Gotcha.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Did anything happen after?  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
No, nothing. We made small talk with Habetrot and  
returned to Chaldea.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Nurse, we must take our leave.  
Tomorrow's schedule will be pretty tight.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Our mission has just begun. Stay alert.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
Yes, of course, Captain. The voyage will be long.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
If you'll excuse us, Fujimaru and Mash.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
Don't stay up too late and refrain from midnight  
snacks. Remember to sleep early and wake up early.   
  
## Day 3
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
All hands, revise the delivery list. Are all packages  
verified and is the preparation checklist fully ticked?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
After we test the vessel's Zero Sail for the last day,  
we'll surface in normal space as scheduled.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Our target today is the American continent.  
Upon arrival, we'll carry out the mission on land with  
the armored vehicle.   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Yikes! This schedule wants to clean up North America  
in one daaay!   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Alternating between Zero Sail and land operation this  
many times in one day will break the Nautiluuus!   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Can we get a veto from the creeew!? Today's mission  
quota is completely unreasonablllle!   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
Quit your yappin', Marine!  
Everyone knows we're pushin' it!   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
Remember we're doin' it because everyone wanted to!  
Too late to call it quits, boys!   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
'Sides, Professor's estimations predict minimal  
danger on the roads. The land parts will be a breeze.   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
No enemy signals found on our routes. The snow'll  
never let up, though.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
...   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
Hm? What's goin' on, Leader? Anythin' on your mind?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Not really. I thought we had a lucky first day,  
but now the lack of enemies on our trajectories is  
starting to look unnatural.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I suppose I'll have to question BB later.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Marines, we won't be cutting short the number of  
Zero Sails. Part of the point is running an endurance  
test.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Keep your eyes peeled for any irregularities in the  
sailing Nautilus. That's your task.   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Yessir... But don't push yourself too hard, okay,  
Captain?   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
If anything happens to the Nautilus, you're the one  
taking the damage, not us.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I know. Now let's begin today's deliveries.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Santa Claus can't fall behind schedule. We will meet  
the appointed times, without fail.   
  
**--BATTLE--**
  
**J：Nemo Engineer:**  
Stop, STOP!  
That's enough, ol' Nikola!   
  
**J：Nemo Engineer:**  
Don't you recognize me?  
Nemo Engineer! Your birdwatchin' buddy!   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
Oh dear. I didn't notice you, Madam Engineer!   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
I beg your pardon. How could a genius of my caliber  
fail to tell a friend apart from a wraith?   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
Letting nostalgia get the better of me was a mistake.  
Doubly so when my trip down memory lane was over  
a past regret.   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
My belated greetings, Nemo Engineer and...   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Nemo Santa. I'm currently away from my captain post.   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
I see. Good day, Nemo Santa.  
I'm a genius. The name is Nikola Tesla.   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
A pioneer inventor beyond compare in human history.   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
The true king of electricity, the one who brought light  
to the daily lives of the common man,   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
and the eccentric, unlucky pigeon-loving gentleman  
who ended one step short of illuminating the world.   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
Also a friend of your other persona, Nemo Engineer.  
You may address me like a good friend.   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
Or if you prefer, like teacher and student. Perhaps  
father and son. Alternatively, father and daughter.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
O-okay. I appreciate the sentiment, but no thanks.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
(Sigh)... I didn't know you were friends with Engineer.   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
Oh. So your information sharing is not  
all-encompassing?   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
Well, everyone has a secret they want to keep to  
themselves. Madam Engineer is still a young maiden at  
heart.   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
Being on affable terms with a perfect gentleman such  
as myself is certainly something she wouldn't be able  
to share with her siblings.   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
Hell no! I simply don't report irrelevant information!   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
Actually, what are you even doin' here? We're in  
North America. Isn't your hometown in Croatia?   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
You're correct, but the United States is the country  
where I made the most important memories of my life.   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
Chiefly so in this land. I wanted to pass by one last  
time before the final battle to recover mankind's future.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I see... I also found that unusual. We're in Long Island,  
New York.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
It's the site of the Wardenclyffe Tower, a super-long-  
range radio tower and transmitter meant to ultimately  
supply energy to the entire planet.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
That was the peak and final destination of Nikola  
Tesla's dream.   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
I wouldn't call it a final destination.  
That was merely one of my many ideas.   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
But I'll have to admit it was the most valued period of  
my life. I still envision it when I have a motivation spike,  
oh yes.   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
Oh, that thing that shows up when you do your Noble  
Phastasm! The huge generator skyscraper, really  
snazzy stuff!   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
It's not a skyscraper, Engineer, it's a tower.  
And it's not a generator either.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
It's a device that sends electricity...as far as the public  
eye is concerned. In reality, it's Nikola Tesla's  
ultra-scientific teleporter.   
  
**Nemo Engineer & Nikola Tesla:**  
It's what?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
A teleporter.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
A device that instantly sends away not only data and  
energy, but physical matter from point A to point B.  
Is that not what it is?   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
Wait, hold on one minute. I don't recall making any  
matter replicator or teleporter.   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
Your drivel makes me nauseous, Nemo Santa.  
Where did you learn such pseudo-science?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Huh? It's, you know, the thing that got used in the  
Philadelphia Experiment...   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
I'd never collaborate in military experimentation!  
The tower is a voltage generator!   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
No way... You mean Nikola Tesla, I mean, the Tesla  
Coil can't teleport physical matter...?   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
Darn, I've never seen him this dejected before.  
Hey, ol' Nikola, it is really impossible for you?   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
(My impulses tell me to call the idea proposterous...  
But I'm not sure about taking away a boy's sincere  
dreams...)   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
Nay. Not to toot my own horn, but the Tesla Coil has  
several possible applications.   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
So I cannot affirm it is absolutely impossible.  
There may be a genius capable of utilizing it in ways  
that defy even my imagination.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I see. Like what, for example?   
  
**Nikola Tesla:**  
Well, music for instance? Just keep in mind that the  
Tesla Coil can do anything.   
  
**Narration:**
- 6:00 PM -  
- End of business hours -   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
Hey there, comin' in! Are you two restin' well?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Oh, just Engineer here today?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
You've got the reindeer cap from the shop!  
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
Y-yeah. It's almost time to open the shop. I wish I was  
workin' in the event store instead of delivery.   
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Thank you for your work, Engineer. No one else is  
joining for today's report?   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
Nope! Funny stuff happened on today's delivery!  
Our jerkwad Leader had a traumatic experience and  
went to bed early!   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
Guy locked himself in the captain's cabin saying,  
“I'll be away for a while. We meet in one hour.”   
  
**Mash:**  
Oh no... Have the consecutive days of work damaged  
his health?   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
Naw, not that. It's the usual routine of eatin' from a  
hidden pudding stash to lift his spirits!   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
Despite his attitude, he's got his dreams about  
ultra-technology, so seeing reality spoils his mood.  
It's nothin' serious.   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
I'll drop the list here and leave.  
Come visit the shop sometime!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...What happened to Santa...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
...Hidden pudding stash, huh...?  
  
---  
  
## Day 4
  
**Narration:**
- 6:00 PM -  
- End of business hours -   
  
**Mash:**  
Phew. We're done, Master! Once again, the  
infrastructure maintenance was handled to 100%  
satisfaction.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(Huff, huff...) Today was tough.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
We managed to get here ahead of Santa...  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
Master? Mash?  
Are you in there? May I come in?   
  
**Mash:**  
Y-yes! Welcome!   
  
**Nemo Baker:**  
Ehehe. If you say so. Hyah!  
Good day to you two. How are you doing?   
  
**Nemo Baker:**  
It's not dinner hours yet, but Nemo Baker's here with  
the turkey☆   
  
**F：Mash:**  
Oh!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
It's a browned turkey...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
You'll get me drooling.  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Baker:**  
Uh-huh. I can bake lots more than just bread!   
  
**Nemo Baker:**  
It's Christmas and I get to wear a Santa outfit.  
I can't miss a chance to make a lot of delicious food!   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
That's said, they shouldn't overeat. Feed them in  
moderation, Baker.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Here's today's written report. Once you're done  
reading, join me in the dining hall to&ndash;   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
&ndash;You look tired. Were you battling in the simulator  
today?   
  
**Mash:**  
D-do we? It was a leisurely day by the kotatsu for us.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I see. So you must have overeaten. When you eat too  
much and don't exercise, your stomach's exhaustion  
shows on your face.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Save the dinner for another day, Baker. Call Nurse to  
give them some digestive medicine.   
  
**Nemo Baker:**  
Aye, sir. Sorry, but he's right about your faces looking  
saggy.   
  
**Nemo Baker:**  
Be patient, you two. You can have some porridge  
today, and the turkey will be for tomorrow.   
  
**Mash:**  
(No, my turkey...)  
S-sure, thank you.   
  
**Nemo Baker:**  
Hehe. With that settled, here, for you.  
It's no substitute for turkey, I know.   
  
**Mash:**  
What is it?   
  
**Nemo Baker:**  
A present from a very heated Servant to his Master,  
so the cold doesn't get the better of you.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Yes. As it has already become a routine, we were  
asked to give this to you.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Good grief. Before meeting him, I already knew this is  
how things would turn out, but wow, winter did nothing  
to get that Servant less heated.   
  
**--BATTLE--**
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Well, it if isn't NEMO!!! Hey, what's going on?   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
My bad for that. But you gotta understand that the  
sudden snow is a shocker. Don't blame me!   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Apologies for that. It's my fault. I should consider  
myself lucky that my suit didn't burn.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Oh, right, that's not your usual get-up.  
Nice and red! I like that color.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I don't think it's that big of a deal...   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
But what do you want with me? I'm here waitin' for  
that Santa fella with my present&ndash;   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
...  
...   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
...?   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Well, it if isn't SANTA!!! I almost missed you with your  
lack of gravitas!   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
...Excuse me, what?   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
A-ah. You're (almost) Santa-ish enough. No  
questioning that.   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Showing my face in the interest of curiosity~  
What's the take on me~?   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Oh, hi, reindeer.   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Well, that was disappointi~ng.  
Much quieter than I expected.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Anyway, you got the present here, right? Is that what  
the deal is?   
  
**O：Nemo Santa:**  
Of course. Santa Claus exists to give nice children  
what they want.   
  
**O：Nemo Santa:**  
If you receive the wrong item, you can get it  
reimbursed. A professional Santa accepts refunds.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Thank ya kindly! Then I'm gonna check what's in the  
box.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Oil...? Is it for cooking? Am I supposed to, like...  
fry some potatoes with it?   
  
**O：Nemo Santa:**  
No, no.   
  
**O：Nemo Santa:**  
It's for coating your weapon...the Chakram.  
Aren't you always rolling it on the ground?   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Yup. When it's Noble Phantasm time, I give it the boot.   
  
**O：Nemo Santa:**  
I know. Professional football players do the same.  
Aren't you bothered by the dirt stains from using it all  
the time?   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Sure, I am! But I just whack it enough to brush off the  
dirt.   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
Not all of it!   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
Dirt and rust that won't come off are the nemesis of  
all engines! That's what this stuff is for!   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Gotcha! Wash it with this oil and it'll be all fixed up!   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
Yup! You got one great gear there, so take care of it  
properly!   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
You're pretty passionate about that...!   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
It's a super oil, so it'll also dirtproof it. The filth will  
bounce right off at tremendous speeds.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
So it solves both stain and friction issues? Hell yeah!  
You some kinda god of oil?   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
It's industrial grade.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Never heard of any god by the name of  
Industrialgrade...   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Well, I'll gladly take it. Thank ya!   
  
**O：Nemo Santa:**  
You're welcome. By the way, don't consider this a  
payment request for the present.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Hah?   
  
**O：Nemo Santa:**  
&mdash;Asvatthaman. I have one question for you.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
That's all. No issues. Mission complete.  
This box is from Asvatthaman to you.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
All right, let's open it.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
I see... It appears to be a piece of jewelry. Is it a  
bracelet?   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Yeah, and take this one with you while you're at it.  
A gift for Master.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
I had already resigned myself to the idea that I'd only  
be able to give my gift after Christmas'd passed.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
But if you're willing to deliver it, I'd appreciate it.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Fine... One more present to Master. I suppose  
everyone had the same idea.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
May I ask what is inside? Knowing you, there's a  
chance it might be an explosive, even if that's not the  
intended use.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Don't worry. It's just a rock I had no use for.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
This is...a ruby?   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Yeah.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
After this one war, I was cursed to wander for 3,000  
years.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
I don't even remember where I went and how.  
Just that it was a real painful walk.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
After all, I didn't have any destination.  
I just kept walking for the sake of it.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
For trivial reasons, I remembered that I was atoning  
for a sin.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
I still don't remember if I was forgiven...  
But regardless, I had the will to atone.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
So here's my advice from experience:   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Never forget what got you takin' that first step.  
Remember it every time you see the shine of this  
stone.   
  
**Aśvatthāman:**  
Pretty meaningful promise, ain't it? It's got that “may  
your journey be blessed and fortunate” meaning to it.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
This bracelet is not just lucky. It's also charged with a  
little bit of magical energy.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Yeah, it's warming.  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I see. He didn't want to you to be defeated by the  
cold and loneliness of winter.   
  
**Mash:**  
Master will need that this winter. Thank you very  
much.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Thank Asvatthaman instead.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
That's all from me. Goodbye. Only three days left of  
your winter break. Don't do anything rash.   
  
## Day 5
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Beep-beep, docking with Nautilus is compleeete!  
Commencing Imaginary Number Submersion!   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Thanks, you're model sailo~rs.  Once again,  
we're on schedu~le.   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
1500 hours, Chaldea time. I believe that's enough to  
come back not long past the regular ho~ur.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Agreed. Today's load is fifteen packages. It can be  
fulfilled in three hours.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
...  
...   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Hello? Captain Santa? Anything profoundly worrying  
you?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
No. It's not really a worry, but I'll call it a day after  
this.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
The way our tracks are laid out is curious, to say the  
least. We should check up on Master and Mash.   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Woohoo, awesome! You mean today's afternoon  
assignment is a party in Master's room?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Yes. If [♂ he /♀️ she] is in [♂ his /♀️ her] room, that is.   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Ooh, so that's what's nagging at you. Always the  
same Captain being hard on indiscipline.   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
I personaly think we should humor their generosity~   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Call me Leader during delivery hours. Well, actually,  
I suppose Captain is fine since we're in the Nautilus...   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Anyway, we don't have a moment to waste.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
The vessel will return to Chaldea immediately after  
the next matter at hand...delivering Scáthach-Skadi's  
present.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Estimated arrival at the Border: 1600 hours.  
All hands, strive to keep time.   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Aye-aye, sir! Messaging Baker to bake a cake...  
Huh, wait a sec.   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Signal from the sonar! Unknown heat source detected!  
Yikes, it's huge! And it wasn't even there a second ago!   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Soooorry, crew. Unavoidable contact in t-minus,  
20 secooonds!   
  
**Narration:**
- 5:00 PM -  
- One hour before end of business hours -   
  
**Mash:**  
Today we're back with time to spare, Senpai.   
  
**Mash:**  
I'm glad we wrapped things up without overwork,  
but was there any particular reason for it?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sharp as always, Mash.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I just felt it's about time we questioned them.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Questioning...if Nemo's crew have any objectives  
beyond delivering presents?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
It's not like I suspect them, but...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Do you know anything, BB?  
  
---  
  
**BB:**  
Huh? You're asking me?   
  
**BB:**  
I'm Zero Shifting you to the delivery areas all over the  
world free of charge,   
  
**BB:**  
and you want me to also spoil the case's secrets?  
Don't you think you're asking for too much?   
  
**Mash:**  
We're immensely grateful for your generosity.   
  
**Mash:**  
But if anything happens to Nemo, it will be our fault  
for not being there.   
  
**Mash:**  
If there's anything you know about Nemo's objective,  
BB, you don't have to reveal it all. I'd love to know any  
parts it would hurt for us not to be privy to.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Likewise. We can't afford any danger.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I certainly hope I'm overthinking things.  
  
---  
  
**BB:**  
...  
Danger, huh?   
  
**BB:**  
I swear that Nemo has no ulterior motives.   
  
**BB:**  
He became Santa simply because he felt like he had  
to.   
  
**BB:**  
His mission list does contain one particularly  
challenging quest. A delivery one might consider  
exceptional.   
  
**BB:**  
Nemo's crew has been engaging many Servants in  
conversation to gather reference material for this  
delivery quest.   
  
**BB:**  
You two feel like Nemo Santa is hiding something  
because he's keeping the contents of these  
conversations under wraps.   
  
**BB:**  
That's all there is to it.  
However...   
  
**BB:**  
Here's my honest advice:  
Don't confront him about it.   
  
**BB:**  
If the two of you press Nemo Santa on this matter,  
he'll abort the quest.   
  
**BB:**  
The special delivery can only succeed if it's done  
without anyone being aware of or affected by it.   
  
**Mash:**  
A delivery no one can be aware of...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...or be affected by?  
  
---  
  
**BB:**  
Correct! A special operation that won't change the  
world to any extent. Essentially, the delivery of an  
empty box!   
  
**BB:**  
Now, you might be asking yourself, “What's the point  
of such a delivery?”. And I feel you on that! You have  
BB's complete agreement!   
  
**BB:**  
But the Phantom Spirit Nemo is staking his soul on  
this absurd and baffling mission.   
  
**BB:**  
He accepted the title of Santa Claus to complete this  
mission.   
  
**BB:**  
Out of respect for his decision, I plead the fifth.   
  
**BB:**  
His acts may be pointless, but I'd never mock him for  
this pointlessness.   
  
**BB:**  
That's all from me! Keep up the good pace in your  
resource collection, you two!   
  
**BB:**  
I mean it, seriously, I'm deep in the red. My Grail Front  
was a complete bust... ServaFes got hijacked...   
  
**BB:**  
Your favorite Superior AI BB will never forget this  
sequence of humiliations.   
  
**BB:**  
I'm currently recharging on the most critically-  
acclaimed resources for my second chance!   
  
**BB:**  
Senpai, if you have any spare change from your  
Christmas shopping, consider donating to the BB  
crowdfund!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sorry, I've been going cashless lately, so no change.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
So that's why she hasn't been hosting the BB Channel...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
What did you think about the conversation, Senpai?   
  
**Mash:**  
BB's conclusion is that we're better off not knowing...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I'm fine with that.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I think there's some point to keeping it secret.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Yes, I agree.   
  
**Mash:**  
I know Nemo's crew has a greater objective,  
but we'll not pry into it.   
  
**Mash:**  
And on top of that, intrusive as it may be, we will help  
the crew's itinerary from behind the scenes.   
  
**Mash:**  
We'll do what we can!  
Now let's wait for the crew's return!   
  
**Narration:**
- 6:30 PM -  
- 30 minutes after the end of business hours -   
  
**Mash:**  
...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
They're still not back...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(Did something happen...?)  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Alright, we're home, safe and so~und.  
Wow, today was the pi~ts.   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
That disaster was completely unpredicted,  
but I believe our experience fighting within Imaginary  
Space paid off.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
You don't have to tell me. I felt like a whale chased by  
a shark.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
We won the battle, but it's already this late thanks to  
that.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Sorry for the wait. Team Nautilus has just arrived.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Professor, you do the report. I still need a little more  
time to catch my breath.   
  
**Mash:**  
Nemo looks exhausted... Did anything happen?   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Sure di~d. We were attacked by odd enemies while en  
route. Here's what happened&ndash;   
  
**--BATTLE--**
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
It was just BB interfering!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
So much for "I plead the fifth"...  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Yeah~. She appeared out of nowhere, got beat like  
always, and took o~ff.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I do believe she had a reason to obstruct&ndash;I mean,  
warn us.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Pretty much any time BB acts like she's on a crime  
spree, it's in defense of a third party's good intentions.   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Makes sense. We managed to read Depth 5 on the  
Zero Sail, so to go any deeper, we have to get past the  
Grands.   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
By the way, here's today's delivery li~st. Another safe  
and clean undersea voyage for Team Nautilu~s.   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
The plan was to be back by 1600 hours, but we were  
late thanks to BB's unexplained interventio~n.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Alright. That's it for the report. Excuse us for now.  
&mdash;Professor.   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Right, we gotta discuss today's mistakes. I'm not  
great at conversation, so I said more than I should.   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Oh, it's important to bring up that I'll appear in the  
shop. I hope you visit if you have time.   
  
## Day 6
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Oh? What luck, running into you in the cafeteria.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Good morning, Fujimaru. Do you have any  
plans for today?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
N-nothing in particular, I guess.  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I see. Take your time and decide over breakfast.  
You still have plenty of winter break left to enjoy.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
We're about to start our Santa work.  
I'm hoping to set a new record today.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Wait a sec.  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Hm? Yes?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Can I ask why it is you're Santa this year?  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
&mdash;   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
That's right. I was originally only nominated by Saint  
Martha, but I took on the role because I had something I  
wanted to deliver.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Santa Claus is a dream that sends good fortune to  
anyone and everyone, isn't he?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I decided based on that miracle.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I became Santa not just for those waiting for presents,  
but also for someone I want to hand a gift.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Compared to the other Santa Servants, I suppose it's  
rather self-serving. But there should be nothing wrong  
with just one of them being that way.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
It's not selfish at all, though.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Good luck out there, Santa Nemo!  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Then, until tonight.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Today's destination is a particularly unusual one.  
Look forward to the tale.   
  
**--BATTLE--**
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
(Phew) Somehow, I still have my head on my  
shoulders. (Lucky I was packing Guts for this.)   
  
**First Hassan:**  
It would not fall. For I have measured the glint of my  
blade according to the strength of thy will. Give thanks  
for the protections of salvation, for they will lead thee  
to thy destination.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
...? Seriously?  
Did Santa Claus always have those attributes?   
  
**First Hassan:**  
...It matters not.   
  
**First Hassan:**  
What be thy business, Phantom Spirit Nemo?  
Didst thou visit me to offer thy pure head before thou  
commitest any barbarity?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Of course not. There's only one reason for Santa to  
show up somewhere.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I have a gift for you, Old Man of the Mountain.  
Though I don't know if it will be to your tastes.   
  
**First Hassan:**  
Inconceivable. My sword is only meant to announce  
the hour of death. There is no longer anything I might  
seek from the world of the living.   
  
**First Hassan:**  
Santa Claus is supposedly one who responds to the  
call of desire in the heart. Mine soul sounds with no  
such echo.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I thought that might be the case. Still, someone gave  
you a present. It was handmade to be delivered just for  
you.   
  
**First Hassan:**  
...!   
  
**Tiamat:**  
I have heard that although there are many Hassans,  
the venerable old one is always by his lonesome.   
  
**Tiamat:**  
So I made something he can enjoy on his own.  
I'm s-s-sure...he'll like it!   
  
**Tiamat:**  
...I hope he does.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
It's a traditional Japanese New Year's meal.  
Well timed, considering the occasion is just around the  
corner.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I hear it's made solely of items that take long to spoil,  
with the intent of making one not need to go to the  
kitchen for the first three days of the year.   
  
**First Hassan:**  
Mine faith does not celebrate the new year in January.  
However&mdash;   
  
**First Hassan:**  
I dare not refuse such a kindness from the Mother of  
Creation.   
  
**First Hassan:**  
&mdash;The box shall be returned by mine own hand.  
Such a task is too heavy for the green arms of my  
followers.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
A-alright. That's great for me as well.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
...  
...   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Um... One other thing, King Hassan...   
  
**First Hassan:**  
Very well. Present thy head.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I haven't even said anything yet!   
  
**First Hassan:**  
Thy intent was betrayed by thine itinerary.   
  
**First Hassan:**  
Thou hath no reason to beg for forgiveness.  
Shouldst thou fail, thou shalt vanish. That be thy  
penance.   
  
**First Hassan:**  
I no longer bear the title of Grand, thus it doth not  
concern me. Nor shall the others take notice,  
save perhaps one.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Do you think...I can do it?   
  
**First Hassan:**  
A meaningless question. Success or failure,  
the result matters not to the world.   
  
**First Hassan:**  
Should thy might be insufficient, thou shall have no  
skeleton to leave behind. Even thy name will be gone  
without trace. Albeit, thou wert always named “No One”.   
  
**First Hassan:**  
No settlement will make itself necessary.  
&ndash;Thus, what reason remains to dwell on thy deed?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I see. Thanks, Old Man. I feel like that's finally taken a  
weight off my shoulders.   
  
**First Hassan:**  
Though take heed.   
  
**First Hassan:**  
For spending an eternity at the border of life and  
death, I hath become the border itself.   
  
**First Hassan:**  
For being so immersed in Death, I hath become Death  
itself.   
  
**First Hassan:**  
Embrace that which should not be, and thou too shalt  
become something that ought not to be&ndash;   
  
**First Hassan:**  
That which brings about the invisible becomes  
invisible.   
  
**First Hassan:**  
In the world metaphysical, only faith doth save one  
from losing their meaning.   
  
**First Hassan:**  
&mdash;Remember this, Captain. So we may meet  
again, at a distant intersection of causality.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
Welcome back, Leader. Did you get your chance to  
pay respects to the Old Man of the Mountain?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Yeah, I did. And he was more frightening than I could  
have ever imagined.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
It seemed like he didn't view our plans as any  
different from his morning prayers.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I asked if what we were doing was acceptable,  
but he basically waved off my indecision.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
To sum it up, he told me,  
“Do what you want, I don't care”.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
My, how harsh. Then shall we proceed as planned?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Yes. Marine, relay to Master that we won't be coming  
back today.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
All hands to general quarters! Prepare for Imaginary  
Numbers dive, Depth 7! Our target is the year 2015 AD!   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
The ship will now travel back to the appointed date!   
  
## Day 7
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Is everyone here? It's about time we go deliver the  
presents, but first...   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
There's something I must tell you. My true reason in  
accepting the Santa Claus role.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Santa Claus is a figure that delivers miracles to many  
by the mere merit of being Santa Claus.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
He delivers presents to all who wish for it, wrapping  
up the year with a nice bow.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
That is Santa Claus' fundamental task and reason for  
being. It's the wish of those gathered in the Holy Night.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
But that's the wish of all people. Not Santa Claus'  
own.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I see no problem with Santa Claus' duties and  
personal wishes existing separately.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Which gets us to my point&mdash;   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
The introduction is takin' forever, Captain Jerkass!  
We all already know what this is about.   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**  
There's one [♂ dude /♀️ gal] we wanna gift of our own accord!   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
That being Master, of course!   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
And not the Master from current Chaldea. But Master  
long before [♂ he /♀️ she] met us!   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
Yes. Because Triton is the child of the sea who  
guarantees a safe voyage.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
We shouldn't give a good luck charm when the  
journey's end is in sight. It's best to give it at the  
journey's start.   
  
**Nemo Nurse:**  
To put a tiny miracle under a sleeping [♂ boy /♀️ girl]'s pillow.  
That's a job for a Santa Claus.   
  
**Nemo Baker:**  
Yeah, you don't need to explain! We know how you  
feel, Captain!   
  
**Nemo Baker:**  
The best present to the person we want to gift the  
most... Right?   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Yu~p. That's a wonderful idea that will only work if  
Santa Claus is no o~ne.   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Although it will be a challenge to accomplish it.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Crew&mdash;   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Yes, you're right. It's more of a desire than a motive.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
The person I want to gift isn't in the present.  
No, to be more accurate, there would be no point in  
giving them the gift now.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Present-day Chaldea has enough capable fighters on  
board. When they need help, they will have someone to  
give it.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
But that's not true for the past's Chaldea.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
At the earliest days of correcting Singularities,  
Chaldea couldn't even spare the time for a coffee  
break. Thus&mdash;   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
To the Antarctic Chaldea base, 2015.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I want to, as subtly as possible, deliver my utmost  
respect to them before [♂ his /♀️ her] long journey comes to a  
start.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
That's something only the Phantom Spirit Nemo  
capable of Zero Sailing can attempt.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
One mistake while interfering with the past will end us.  
If we change past events, no matter how insignificant,   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
the force of historical correction will have no mercy in  
making it so we never existed.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
If we even get there, anyway. Sailing to past  
coordinates is no easy task.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Each year we swim upstream carries a greater risk of  
the Nautilus being crushed by the pressure.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Each annual layer will put new obstacles in our path.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Knowing that, will you humor my whim?   
  
**Everyone:**  
Absolutely!  
Aye-aye, Captain!   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
&ndash;Thank you. Then let's review the operation.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Even jumping through Imaginary Space, traveling to  
the past is extremely difficult.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
We travel back one year per day, and upon reaching  
each goal, we mark it with a PAPERMOON pin and  
make it our next starting point.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
As soon as the pin is set, we resurface the Nautilus to  
regular time and leave the vessel recovering while we  
deliver presents.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
And after seven days, the vessel will travel back  
to 2015, and then the contact with the most intense  
Saint Graph among us will resume the mission on land.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Any questions so far?   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Oh, I have one!   
  
**Nemo Marine:**  
Since we're warping to 2015, can we stop the  
bombing?   
  
**F：Nemo Professor:**  
That's the worst alteration you could ma~ke.   
  
**F：Nemo Professor:**  
If you prevented the explosion, that would erase the  
present Chaldea~   
  
**F：Nemo Professor:**  
When you jump to the past, you generally can't  
change anything that already happened.   
  
**F：Nemo Professor:**  
Or more accurately, WE can't change anything that  
already happened because we don't have any parallel  
world mobility.   
  
**F：Nemo Professor:**  
If you managed to infiltrate the 2015 Chaldea base  
and did something that didn't happen in the past,  
Marine...   
  
**F：Nemo Professor:**  
It's you who would be erased. Instantly.   
  
**F：Nemo Professor:**  
No altering, not appending. That's the rules for this  
mission.   
  
**C：Nemo Marine:**  
...I got it. Can we at least talk to someone?   
  
**C：Nemo Marine:**  
Even if I can't change their fate, at least saying thank  
you should be...   
  
**F：Nemo Professor:**  
...Not necessarily safe.   
  
**F：Nemo Professor:**  
Because an expression of gratitude would be an  
attitude that the subject can't understand the reason  
for, bearing a risk of changing their future actions.   
  
**F：Nemo Professor:**  
If you have to talk with someone, the conversation  
must be something that makes sense and won't stand  
out to the people at the Chaldea base of that time.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
You heard Professor. The infiltration will require  
utmost attention.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
The contact will swim solo through the sea of  
Imaginary Numbers, Zero Sail to Antarctica,  
and infiltrate the base.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Achieve the objective without being spotted by a soul.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I've obtain the Chaldea shift sheet for the day in  
question. We also have the route to the objective  
already mapped out.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
There's still a minor risk of coming across a staff  
member, but the route was chosen based on which of  
them would reasonably be where.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
The next step in the roadmap is creating the disguise  
apparatus to falsify the contact's appearance.  
There's still one last challenge:   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Convincingly playing the role of the individual the  
contact will be disguised as. But fortunately,  
this is a solved problem. Don't worry about it.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
That's the outline of the operation.  
Any questions?   
  
**O：Nemo Santa:**  
&mdash;Excellent.  
The vessel will now commence the special mission.   
  
**O：Nemo Santa:**  
Operation: 8 Years Snow Carol.   
  
**O：Nemo Santa:**  
I'm counting on every one of you. I swear on Santa  
Claus' name that we will deliver this package!   
  
**--BATTLE--**
  
**Merlin:**  
Aw, I only came here to give you some advice and you  
treat me like a nuisance. Am I really so annoying?   
  
**Merlin:**  
Be that as it may, I can't look past such a reckless  
waste of human resources. Chaldea's going to need you  
in the future.   
  
**Merlin:**  
Why not call it quits here, Nemo? Santa Claus is a  
one-day miracle. It'd be ridiculous to stake your life  
over it.   
  
**Merlin:**  
There's nothing to gain if you succeed, and no one to  
be disappointed if you don't.   
  
**Merlin:**  
Time travelling to the past is cheating, you know.  
This is especially unlike you.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Your insincere advice is well-recieved, Magus Merlin.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I'm honored that you would go out of your way to visit  
us during an Imaginary Numbers dive.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
&ndash;But what do you mean by that? I heard your  
words clearly, but I'd like to check just in case.   
  
**Merlin:**  
The part about “nothing to gain”, I take it?  
Yes, it's sad but true.   
  
**Merlin:**  
What it is you've all been struggling to send [♂ him /♀️ her]   
  
**Merlin:**  
is a smidgen of good luck at so small a trace that it  
will fail to tamper with the past.   
  
**Merlin:**  
A dreamcatcher, a talisman that repels bad luck so as  
not to meet with sorrow in battles to come.   
  
**Merlin:**  
The plan is to leave behind a Chaldea uniform with  
one woven in that nobody will notice.   
  
**Merlin:**  
Your references for approaching the past came from  
conversations with the fossil-digging lady and the man  
with Shiva's authority.   
  
**Merlin:**  
The seamstress fairy was commissioned to take on  
the part of perfectly reproducing the uniform.   
  
**Merlin:**  
The one you sought to teach teleportation theory  
unfortunately had nothing, but the Old Man of the  
Mountain, ever the softie, chose to turn you a blind eye.   
  
**Merlin:**  
However, your efforts will have no meaning even if you  
go the distance.   
  
**Merlin:**  
“Travel into the past and swap out the uniform with no  
one the wiser.”   
  
**Merlin:**  
“If Master wears it never knowing about the imparted  
gift, no conflicts in reality will occur.”   
  
**Merlin:**  
Sure. Doing it that way won't cause a time paradox.  
But it will also have practically no effect.   
  
**Merlin:**  
A charm can only be as effective as its owner believes  
it can be.   
  
**Merlin:**  
A talisman you don't even know you bear is hardly  
more than a little peace of mind.   
  
**Merlin:**  
The amount of luck you're adding is, let me see,  
enough to make a person who has regular nightmares  
wake up one second sooner.   
  
**Merlin:**  
Put simply, it does nothing. You understand?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I've known all this from the very start. Verifying it was  
the first thing I did.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
“Santa Claus is a one-day miracle. It'd be ridiculous to  
stake your life over it.”   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
If you truly mean that, we can go right back to fighting.  
I'll prove to you that it's no fool's errand.   
  
**Merlin:**  
Truly?   
  
**Merlin:**  
To go and risk tampering with the past, with a good  
chance of your erasure, all for the sake of some luck  
that may not even register as a margin of error?   
  
**Merlin:**  
With the risk of it never taking effect, never changing  
anything, even if you manage? It's not worth it at all.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Sure. Chaldea will get from there to here even if I  
don't do this. My actions will contribute nothing to their  
victories.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
But that isn't the point.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
It's not a question of someone late in arriving  
rewarding someone who's there already.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
The chance to gain any rewards or joy has passed us  
by. We never were able to make room for them as  
comrades.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Even then, she wanted to lend them aid. Calling the  
act itself its own reward with a smile.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
...That's right. Even if the difference is so insignificant  
that SHEBA can't observe it,   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I don't consider the extra bit meaningless. I admire  
the courage of people who leap into the storm for  
something unnecessary.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
...as this one summoner has in [♂ his /♀️ her] lifetime.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
So don't call the act of paying whatever I can to give  
them a measure of peace a fool's errand.   
  
**Merlin:**  
...Now I get it. My Clairvoyance only views the present.   
  
**Merlin:**  
I'd always assume the reason why you looked blurry  
in my eyes was because of the vampire, but it turns out  
it was something else.   
  
**Merlin:**  
Allow me to rephrase, with apologies.  
“Ridiculously marvelous.”   
  
**Merlin:**  
Huh. The real fool looks to be wearing my shoes.  
I should've known better than to think the Old Man  
misjudged.   
  
**Merlin:**  
Excuse me for trying to complicate a smooth journey,  
Heroic Spirit Nemo. I'll keep your wish well in mind.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Well, thanks. For my part, I'm grateful you came to  
offer advice.   
  
**Merlin:**  
Oh, right. Pass on my regards to the man if you find  
him there.   
  
**Merlin:**  
Call him an idiot for me. The two of you will probably  
hit it off well.   
  
## 8 Years Snow Carol
  
**Narration:**
When we are eight minutes from the destination,  
I leave the Nautilus through the hatch and go solo into  
the sea of Imaginary Numbers.   
  
**Narration:**
We can't approach further with the Nautilus.  
SHEBA would notice a submarine surfacing in the the  
Antarctic.   
  
**Narration:**
I'll be the only one going to the Chaldea base,  
and I'll have to do it with minimal equipment.   
  
**Narration:**
Because we're going backwards in time, a violent  
spatial current will try to push my body away the  
further I go.   
  
**Narration:**
I'll swap in my merman legs and swim this blender of  
a spatial torrent.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
&mdash;  
&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**
I'm confronted by sub-zero temperatures and the  
pressure of one wrong step erasing me.   
  
**Narration:**
I'm used to swimming in Imaginary Space, but things  
are different when you add movement through time.   
  
**Narration:**
The average Servant's Saint Graph can't endure it.  
It's exhausting just to stay still within the flow,  
let alone swim against it.   
  
**Narration:**
I can only survive for sixty seconds. I never felt one  
second feel so long under the water.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
&mdash;  
&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**
The vertigo blocks my sight.  
The fear blanks my mind.   
  
**Narration:**
My teeth clench intensely, forcibly dragging my  
shattered senses back to normality.   
  
**Narration:**
The distance until the target destination is seven hours.  
Will I really make it that far?   
  
**Narration:**
Before that, will my Saint Graph even survive the  
remaining real time? This operation has no room for  
error.   
  
**Narration:**
My Saint Graph will only last sixty seconds,  
which by chance is also the fastest estimated time to  
reach the destination.   
  
**Narration:**
No mistakes allowed.  
No loss of speed allowed.   
  
**Narration:**
If just my pinky slips out of the flow toward 2015,  
the mission fails and my body is dust.   
  
**Narration:**
I'd be literally swimming toward my death.  
No man, sane or otherwise, would carry out this  
mission.   
  
**Narration:**
The return you get out of it is not remotely  
comparable to the difficulty of the voyage.   
  
**Narration:**
Then, what do we gain out of this operation?   
  
**Merlin:**  
“Sure. Doing it that way won't cause a time paradox.  
But it will also have practically no effect.”   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
&mdash;  
&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**
The spatial current gets more violent.  
A white wall blocks my path.   
  
**Narration:**
There, I catch glimpses of someone's memory.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
But Master candidate isn't exactly the right word.  
Since originally, you were meant to be a plain  
candidate.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Hm? There's a comm.  
Hello?   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Kadoc woke up? He's in good health? That's great!  
Contact the control room as soon as possible.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Good news, Fujimaru! Kadoc has  
recovered!   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Now you can go back to being a spare! Navigation's  
gonna be so much easier for us too!   
  
**Meunière:**  
Huh? There's no need for that at all! Both your  
training and your mission are a thing of the past.   
  
**Meunière:**  
You're just a civilian with no accomplishments.  
You don't need to force yourself to work hard  
anymore.   
  
**Meunière:**  
Leave that stuff to us and go relax in your room.   
  
**Gordolf:**  
Don't go around listening to what the inhabitants of  
the Lostbelts have to say. In terms of heartbreak,  
we are far worse off than they are.   
  
**Gordolf:**  
We are the winners from Pan-Human History,  
the proper route. We cannot afford to fail... We cannot...   
  
**Gordolf:**  
But what can twelve people even do...? Restoration  
and prosperity have long since gone out the window!   
  
**Gordolf:**  
You know how doomed we are! Do they understand  
this loneliness, this pressure!?   
  
**Gordolf:**  
They are the ones who should concede!  
They are the ones who will disappear!   
  
**Gordolf:**  
Their suffering pales in comparison to ours!   
  
**Oberon:**  
Yeah. You are a peculiar one.   
  
**Oberon:**  
You've had many brushes with death, and fortune  
saved you each time.   
  
**Oberon:**  
You've abandoned the world many times, and each  
time saved in turn by misfortune.   
  
**Oberon:**  
You have forsaken many lives.  
You have killed many worlds.   
  
**Oberon:**  
To think you're still doing fine, even after all that?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
&mdash;Yes.   
  
**Merlin:**  
The amount of luck you're adding is, let me see,  
enough to make a person who has regular nightmares  
wake up one second sooner.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
That's enough of a recompense.   
  
**CHALDEAS:**  
&mdash;Base sequence: human genome confirmed  
&mdash;Alignment: Good-Neutral   
  
**CHALDEAS:**  
Welcome to the data center for the future of  
humankind.  
This is the Security Organization for the Preservation  
of Humanity, Chaldea.   
  
**CHALDEAS:**  
Fingerprint, voiceprint, and DNA authentication  
cleared.  
Magical Circuit assessment complete.   
  
**CHALDEAS:**  
Username matched.  
You are recognized as a member of the primates.   
  
**CHALDEAS:**  
Nice to meet you.  
You're our final visitor today.   
  
**CHALDEAS:**  
We hope you enjoy your time here.   
  
**Narration:**
That day, the 48th Master candidate entered Chaldea.  
[♂ He /♀️ She] was a common [♂ boy /♀️ girl] with no knowledge of  
magecraft,   
  
**Narration:**
but was scouted in a haste because [♂ his /♀️ her] extremely high  
Rayshift aptitude was discovered.   
  
**Narration:**
As a matter of fact, four teams were assembled for  
the first Singularity exploration via Rayshift,  
labelled from A through D.   
  
**Narration:**
However, no one would have bothered to take notice  
of the newly-arrived Master candidate,   
  
**Narration:**
who was scouted to fill the 48th Coffin.   
  
**Narration:**
Therefore, the manouevering went smoothly.   
  
**Narration:**
So, replace the Master uniform that'll be delivered  
upon the entrance inspection for the one I brought with  
me.   
  
**Narration:**
Chaldea's activity log reported a shortage of supplies  
later, meaning [♂ he /♀️ she] won't be provided a new uniform  
until January 2017 at the soonest.   
  
**Narration:**
After Chaldea returns to normal space, [♂ his /♀️ her] used  
clothes will be disposed of, but [♂ he /♀️ she] will use them in the  
meantime.   
  
**Elron:**  
Huh? What are you doing out in this section?   
  
**???:**  
Just on my way back after a nice cup of coffee in the  
break room. What got you to leave your post?   
  
**???:**  
You're sure you want to leave the entrance gate  
unattended?   
  
**Elron:**  
Any little thing that'll get me out of that chair.  
I figure a few minutes won't hurt, since there's no  
more visits slated today.   
  
**???:**  
I guess not. Most of the staff's assembled in the  
Command Room, so there's nothing to supervise.   
  
**Elron:**  
You're not joining them?   
  
**???:**  
Nah, I'm full-time in the warehouse. The Rayshift  
experiments are the last thing on my mind.   
  
**???:**  
I got fed up with magi screwing each other over.  
That's why I took this job at so remote a research  
facility.   
  
**???:**  
The squabbling over credit is sure to start the moment  
the Rayshift succeeds, no matter how the Masters fare.   
  
**???:**  
All that amounts to is a hassle. I want no part in the  
Clock Tower's faction nonsense.   
  
**Elron:**  
I suppose. The proprietary technology is mostly  
Animusphere's, but a little bit from every Department's  
gone into the minutiae.   
  
**Elron:**  
The other Lords must have spies dispatched here.  
I'd say that's not your element.   
  
**???:**  
No, ma'am. And it's why I'm going straight back to  
the warehouse. See you, Elron.   
  
**???:**  
...You probably shouldn't leave your post at the gate  
just because there's nothing to do. If the Director finds  
out, she'll raise hell again.   
  
**Elron:**  
Sure, sure. Thanks for the advice.   
  
**Narration:**
Our conversation ended naturally. Meeting her here  
was within the considered possibilities.   
  
**Narration:**
Perfectly as planned. Now to go somewhere no one  
will see me dive into Imaginary Space&mdash;   
  
**Cheery Voice:**  
Oh, hello. On your way back from the break room too?   
  
**???:**  
&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**
A small chill runs down my spine. This was an  
unforeseen encounter with an unexpected individual.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
It does lay on a burden, huh? Everyone in Chaldea's  
on pins and needles, feeling like the slightest mistake  
would be fatal.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
But there's really no helping that part. This is the day  
we all came here for.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
The Director's speech will start any time now,  
with all the Masters and staff gathered round.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
You people probably don't care much about this in the  
Neutral Faction, but you should put in an appearance.  
It'll make an impression with the Director.   
  
**???:**  
No, I'm going straight back to the Moonlight  
Room&ndash;slip of the tongue, to the warehouse.   
  
**???:**  
I don't like seeing the Director put in that spot.  
It's not how she normally acts in general.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
I couldn't agree more! You always do know how to put  
things frankly!   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
She never listens when I say anything. You should put  
it in writing for the suggestion box.   
  
**???:**  
Is it okay even to say that I don't like her?   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
I mean say she's not normally like that.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Director Olga Marie herself hates the “mid-speech  
Director” more than anyone.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
If she heard it from a staff member of your status,  
she might just warm to that side of her.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
...By the way, there's something I couldn't help but  
notice. Aren't you&mdash;   
  
**???:**  
A-am I what?   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Aren't you considerably fatigued? I don't know,  
you look as though you've circled the world on foot.   
  
**???:**  
I wouldn't go that far for a cup of coffee. Go on,  
check whether I'm showing the miles on my face.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
If you say so. Must've been my imagination...  
You had that look about you from behind.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Sorry. Diagnosing someone on impression alone is no  
way for a physician to behave...   
  
**???:**  
...That's nothing to feel bad about. You're not wrong.  
I am pretty tired.   
  
**???:**  
I'm just out on a real important task. Intense work  
isn't easy on anyone.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Okay. Thanks for putting in all you have.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Try not to overdo it again. Now that this is over,  
take on a lighter task next.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Work will always be painful and tiresome, but when  
it's unenjoyable, there's nothing else going for it.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
After a big task for everyone's good, I recommend a  
fun task for your own.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
If it can be done with close friends, all the better.  
For you and them alike.   
  
**???:**  
&mdash;Since when friends enter the conversation?   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Oh... Sorry, just a bad guess on my part. I might have  
misjudged you as someone who enjoyed being alone.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
But I can tell from our short chat that you're a rather  
responsible individual.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
I'm sure the people around you think highly of you.  
They'll give you a hand when you need it.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Cherish the opportunities to share favors and laughs  
as much as you can.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Come by the medical office if you have the time.  
It's fine to be in good health, but better safe than  
sorry.   
  
**Narration:**
I watched the man wave goodbye and walk away.  
Against my better judgement, I called to him.   
  
**???:**  
Excuse me. Can I ask you a quick question?   
  
**Narration:**
The man lazily turned turned around, waiting for the  
inquiry.   
  
**???:**  
There's this friend of mine, not me, that I heard this  
thing from...   
  
**Narration:**
  
Just a hypothetical.   
  
**Narration:**
  
What if two worlds, equal yet different, were  
competing for survival?   
  
**Narration:**
  
The question wasn't about the worlds themselves,   
  
**Narration:**
  
but about an outsider that witnessed the competition  
and could decide which world got to live.   
  
**Narration:**
  
Would the outsider be good or evil? I needed to know  
his opinion.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Hmm... Are you talking about some movie? Sorry,  
it's too complex for me to have an immediate opinion...   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Going by the set rules of the battle being inevitable  
and allowing only one survivor,   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
the question of whether the outsider is good or evil  
isn't relevant. Your question needs to be asked in  
different terms.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Every conflict between humans is a clash of values.  
You should be asking, “Was the outsider right or wrong?   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Pretty much everyone thinks they're right. You could  
even say people can only do what they believe to be  
right.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Therefore, no matter how just the opposition's cause  
may be, if they're choosing to be antagonistic,  
they are fundamentally wrong.   
  
**???:**  
...Everyone is invariably wrong.   
  
**???:**  
That goes both for them, your enemy; and for you,  
their enemy.   
  
**???:**  
In a battle for survival, the most good-natured person  
in the world still wouldn't be objectively right...   
  
**???:**  
Is that what you mean?   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Yeah. And you just gotta accept that.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
The worst thing you can do is believe your side has  
the one correct answer.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
The winner is not the one who is right. They're simply  
the ones who earn the right to see what comes next.   
  
**???:**  
So you think everyone is wrong when multiple peoples  
fight for survival. Then who is right? Are you saying  
being right is realistically impossible?   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Your heart is right, in this moment where you're  
asking these questions.   
  
**Narration:**
The man in a lab coat said that to be right is to  
meditate on the fact that you survived.   
  
**Narration:**
Looking at it from another angle, he wished for us to  
be like that.   
  
**Narration:**
It was a conventional answer. A conventional form of  
care. But his words were filled with the utmost  
conviction.   
  
**Narration:**
As if he was a sage living in the summit of a mountain.  
The one who watched many wars and conflicts.   
  
**???:**  
&mdash;It wasn't about me, okay? I was asking for a  
friend.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Oops, I forgot that part! Never mind me!   
  
**Narration:**
  
Why is he acting like he goofed up? He totally believes  
the question was about me.   
  
**Narration:**
  
...I can see how carrying out an year-long operation  
with this guy would give you an imperturbable peace of  
mind...   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Well, gotta go now. I'm the one in charge of the  
medical sector, somehow.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
The Director will probably me kick me out  
immediately, but I'm going to say hi at the Control  
Room.   
  
**???:**  
&mdash;Wait, please. I've got a, uh, weird request.   
  
**???:**  
Do you have a spare of something you're always  
carrying around? A pen, or something easily  
replaceable like that?   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Yeah, I walk with a few on hand. I never know when  
I'll be called to the field. Are these what you want?   
  
**???:**  
One more pair, if it's not too much. I could use some  
too in my warehouse work.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Of course, ask whenever you like! It's always great to  
see my professionalism appreciated!   
  
**???:**  
That was not about my opinion on your professionalis-  
m at all... With all due respect, you're an idiot.   
  
**???:**  
But I'll try to adopt your stupid way to see everything  
in a positive light.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Will you? Thanks. I was trying to cheer you up,  
and yet I'm the one hit with the best words of  
encouragement.   
  
**Man in Lab Coat:**  
Goodbye for real now.  
Have a nice day, Meunière.   
  
**Narration:**
&mdash;The lab coat fades into the distance.   
  
**Narration:**
My salute to this man I never truly met, will never meet,  
and don't even know the name of.   
  
**Narration:**
Nothing afterward changed.   
  
**Narration:**
He headed towards his own “moment of truth”,  
much like I did to reach here.   
  
**Narration:**
- 4:00 PM -  
- Fujimaru's Room, Day 7 -   
  
**Mash:**  
After what happened the other day, today we came  
back an hour earlier than usual.   
  
**Mash:**  
This way, we have plenty of time left to wait for the  
Nemos to return...   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Oh, you're early today. I didn't think you'd be back  
yet.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Uhh, back yet from what?  
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Nothing else needs to be said, is there? Pardon me  
for inquiring.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Good work out there, Nemo Santa.  
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
...Good to be back. Though my work isn't over quite  
yet.   
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
G-good work out there, Nemo Santa. You returned  
two hours ahead of your usual time.   
  
**Mash:**  
Did something unusual happen?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I suppose so. I can't elaborate, for various reasons.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
...   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
...  
...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Nemo?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Santa?  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
No, this is no time to act embarrassed. I'm going to  
say it out loud, like a leader ought to!   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
The truth is, I couldn't deliver a single gift all day  
today. Something I consider a very un-Santa gaffe.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
...Though that's a small issue altogether. I know this  
subject is coming up a bit too late, but...   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I'd been dismissing you two when you were Santa  
Clauses of a different kind, Fujimaru, Mash.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I'd like to right that wrong...um, if there is still time to  
do so.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
There are still presents left over, you see. Would you  
like to come along for the deliveries?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Certainly!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
We've had more than enough downtime!  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Glad to hear it, you two. There isn't much time,  
so let's get right back to delivering.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
It's going to occupy us past midnight. Be sure to dress  
for the cold and pack a late-night snack.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
I'm prepared, naturally. I'm in need of some enjoyable  
work, you see?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
As soon as the last gift is away, I've got a small  
present to give to both of you.   
  
**Mash:**  
A present for us? That should be fun. What sort of gift  
will it be?   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
The fun is in the waiting. The memories of a one-time  
holy night like this can be a gift in themselves.   
  
**Nemo Santa:**  
Just a little something I found while playing  
warehouseman, and that both of you should be able to  
appreciate more now.
