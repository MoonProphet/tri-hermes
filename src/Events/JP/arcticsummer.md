**Narration:**   
A bleached white Earth.  
  
**Narration:**   
A bleaching of humanity.  
  
**Narration:**   
Indeed, everything on the surface has been bleached.  
  
**Narration:**   
“Oh?”  
  
**Narration:**   
“Even a place such as this was bleached?”  
  
**Narration:**   
There is no color on a blank slate Earth, and there’s no life moving on it either.  
  
**Narration:**   
It’s a horizon of pure white as far as the eye can see.  
No matter where you looked in the world&mdash;no matter what place you even see&mdash;there’s not much of a difference.  
  
**Narration:**   
“I thought perhaps maybe in the far north.”  
  
**Narration:**   
“Hmm.”  
  
**Narration:**   
“It really is all white.”  
  
**Narration:**   
“The Arctic Circle... The Arctic Ocean.”  
  
**Narration:**   
The place that she was looking at&mdash;originally&mdash;should have been a sea covered in an endless amount of dense ice.  
  
**Narration:**   
It has been bleached to a blank slate; the very land itself was bleached.  
  
**Narration:**   
I see. So the bleaching of humanity is not as simple as land mass conversion.  
  
**Narration:**   
If that’s the case, does it depend on some kind of mystery—---?   
  
**Narration:**   
“Empty as far as the eye can see.”  
  
**Narration:**   
“Excellent.”  
  
**Narration:**   
“With the way this is, then it’s doable.”  
  
**Narration:**   
“&mdash;Precisely. Hey, isn’t this a great place?”  
  
**Narration:**   
She laughs at the whitened land.   
  
**Narration:**   
It wasn’t a smile you could call human.

**Scathach-Skadi:**   
The time has come...  
  
**Scathach-Skadi:**   
In my hand is the Holy Grail, and before me is the whitened land.  
  
**Scathach-Skadi:**   
Fufufu......  
  
**Scathach-Skadi:**   
Fufu, fufufufufufufufufufufufu.  
If I, Skadi, can stop this, then I shall!  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/2G3h02k.png)  
  
**Thrud:**   
Please stop this at once, Skadi-sama!  
  
  
**Thrud:**   
To get away this far from Chaldea......  
Why would you be doing this?!  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/Z4kOtBZ.png)  
  
**Hildr:**   
She’s right, this isn’t like you at all, Skadi-sama!  
Let’s go home and eat some ice cream!  
  
**Ortlinde:**   
That’s right...  
Master will be saddened too!  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/baanmLA.png)  
  
**Ortlinde:**   
Even if you’re using Primordial Runes, it’ll be a burden doing this all alone, long-term.  
  
**Ortlinde:**   
Come, let’s go back.  
  
**Scathach-Skadi:**   
Hmm.....  
  
**Scathach-Skadi:**   
Master, huh?  
  
**Hildr:**   
(Twitch!)  
  
**Hildr:**   
Yes, yes, Master--!  
They’ll be sad to hear if you went out of line and brought out a Holy Grail!  
  
**Thrud:**   
Where did you even get one of those to begin with?! That Holy Grail!  
  
**Thrud:**   
The underground vaults are currently sealed and managed under tight security. If that’s true, then...  
  
**Ortlinde:**   
...That’s a brand new Holy Grail.  
Is that the case, Skadi-sama?!  
  
**Scathach-Skadi:**   
...Fu.  
  
**Scathach-Skadi:**   
Fufufufufufufufufufu.  
That’s right, you could say in a way that’s how I got this Holy Grail.  
  
**Scathach-Skadi:**   
No one can stand in my way. Yes, not even if it’s Master.  
  
**Scathach-Skadi:**   
Behold&mdash;

**Scathach-Skadi:**   
Fufu... What do you think?  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/2G3h02k.png)  
  
**Thrud:**   
# A Swimsuit Saint Graph?!  
  
**Thrud:**   
W-Wait, if you wanted to just change your Saint Graph, you could have just used your Runes...  
  
**Hildr:**   
But to use the Holy Grail for just something like that...  
  
**Ortlinde:**   
It can’t be!  
  
**Scathach-Skadi:**   
It is what you suspect. But you’ve realized it too late, Ortlinde.  
  
  
**Scathach-Skadi:**   
With all my love, here in the very Arctic&mdash;  
I will paint a new Singularity.   
  
**3 Sisters:**   
!!  
  
**--ARROW--**

**Valkyrie?:**  
I’ve found one of them.  
  
**Valkyrie?:**  
Hey, can you spare one second?  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/BvP3PU3.png)  
  
**Erice:**   
Sure?  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/BjZRVi3.png)  
  
**Valkyrie??:**  
You two over there, can you spare a moment?

**Jeanne Alter:**   
Heh, what do the Valkyries of Scandinavia want with us-----?  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
H-Huh?   
Isn’t your Saint Graph a bit different than the norm?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
Well, well it’s fine! They could be Swimsuit Saint Graphs, no?!  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Swimsuit Saint Graphs~?  
  
**Valkyrie??:**  
(Grin)  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/EB1SjNZ.png)  
  
**Valkyrie???:**  
&mdash;。  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/AqLkS73.png)  
  
**Sei Shōnagon:**   
Hnghh~ That’s uber cute! Valkyrie’s Swimsuit Saint Graph is too cute~!  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/MaC9wdG.png)  
  
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I get it. How fascinating.  
Um, wait one second.  
  
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Is that what I think it is?  
Could this be a midsummer military style?  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/NYSlXw0.png)  
  
**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**   
Well, that’s what it looks like to me.  
It looks lovely and come to think of it,  
  
**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**   
It reminds me of the Summer Saint Graph of Osakebehime’s.  
It suits you well. Um... what was your name again----?  
  
**Sei Shōnagon:**   
Huh?  
  
**Sei Shōnagon:**   
It isn't <ruby>Thrud<rt>S u r u r i n</rt></ruby> or <ruby>Hildr<rt>Hirurin</rt></ruby> or <ruby>Ortlinde<rt>Orurin</rt></ruby> ...  
  
**Sei Shōnagon:**   
Where did this girl even come from?  
  
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
?!  
  
**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**   
Indeed, they’re not any of them, yet they have the same scent.  
If that’s the case&mdash;what do we call you?  
  
**Valkyrie???:**  
I wonder if I should say they’re spot on.  
  
**Valkyrie???:**  
All of the Valkyrie Saint Graphs should be exactly the same, but they saw through me so accurately.  
  
**Valkyrie???:**  
Nice to meet you, Chaldean Heroic Spirits.  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/EB1SjNZ.png)  
  
**Valkyrie???:**  
My name is Ers,. The formal name is Gerskögul.  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/IZoNGRP.png)  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/CzZ5yMs.png)  
  
**Valkyrie?:**  
The name of this particular unit is Rindr. Nice to meet you.  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/JUgZlkp.png)  
  
**Valkyrie??:**  
Orun. Ah, but my official name is Ölrún!  
Pleased to make your acquaintance!   
  
**Örun:**   
We’re the new three Valkyrie sisters.  
  
**Örun:**   
We are the freshly summoned Valkyries, different from our big sisters.  
  
**Jeanne:**   
I see. I understand now.  
I saw that you had a good shot----Are you an Archer?  
  
**Jeanne:**   
No... judging from how your presence was concealed, are you an Assassin?  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Ooh, a new Servant, huh?  
Didn’t hear anything from Master about this, though?  
  
**D：Örun:**   
You’re sharp!  
  
**D：Örun:**   
You’re right, we’re not Chaldean Servants.  
  
**D：Örun:**   
We’re the Valkyrie sisters, summoned by the North Pole Queen, Scathach = Skadi!  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Skadi~?  
  
**D：Örun:**。  
Oh, we’re Servants of Pan-Human History. Make no mistake about it.  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZXf1PR4.png)  
  
**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**   
So&mdash;  
  
**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**   
On what business is a Servant outside of Chaldea here for?  
Scathach = Skadi is one of us...  
  
**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**   
Surely you’re not suggesting a rebellion are you?  
  
**C：Ers:**   
...  
  
**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**   
If you dare turn against Chaldea and Master, I’ll cleave that Saint Graph of yours on the spot&mdash;  
  
**Sei Shōnagon:**   
That’s a rather quick judgment call?!  
  
**Sei Shōnagon:**   
Hey listen, Rico-pin, they’ve got firearms.  
Shouldn’t we be hearing them out first?  
  
**Sei Shōnagon:**   
If they wanted to have a brawl, they would’ve done it already long ago.  
  
**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**   
Fufu, I guess that’s true.  
I was rather quick to judge.  
  
**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**   
It is that time of year, you know. Never could know what prohibited Saint Graphs would start rebelling.  
  
**Minamoto no Yorimitsu:**   
So as a mother&mdash;or rather&mdash;as Chairman of the Shadow Disciplinary Committee, I have to steel my mind…  
  
**Sei Shōnagon:**   
True, it’s already summer before we had even realized it...  
We should get our swimsuits ready soon too---  
  
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Um, the current matter is not really about swimsuits...  
  
  
**C：Ers:**   
Oh, that! Yes, that!  
  
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Y-Yes to what?  
  
**C：Ers:**   
Swimsuits! That’s us sisters&mdash;  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/CzZ5yMs.png)  
  
**D：Rindr:**   
We’re the Three Sisters, the Three Valkyrie Sisters with Swimsuit Saint Graphs!  
  
**Erice:**   
Three Valkyrie Sisters with Swimsuit Saint Graphs...?  
  
**D：Rindr:**   
Yeah, you got it. Understand?  
  
**Erice:**   
I underst...  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/xCGHiZx.png)  
  
**Erice:**   
......  
  
**Erice:**   
.........??  
  
**Erice:**   
Nono, I don't. I don’t get it at all! What even is a Swimsuit Saint Graph to begin with?!  
  
  
**Erice:**   
Sure, when it's summer...  
There were Servants who had their Saint Graphs modified,  
  
**Erice:**   
But I haven’t heard the specifics, and I’ve never even got to ask Master myself...  
  
**Erice:**   
I don’t actually know&mdash;  
  
**D：Rindr:**   
Ohh, so that’s the fuss.  
It’s not a problem!   
  
**D：Rindr:**   
Not only do we need those who had experience with Swimsuit Saint Graphs, we also need new Servants too!  
  
**D：Rindr:**   
I choose you! Come, let’s go!  
  
**Erice:**   
Go where...?  
  
**D：Rindr:**   
O Primordial Rune!  
Grant her a Summer Get-up, right here!

**Both:**   
!  
  
**A：Jeanne:**   
We’ve changed to our Swimsuit Saint Graphs, haven’t we...?  
  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You could’ve avoided that! The hell did you grab my arm so quickly for?  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
*I* could’ve avoided that!!  
  
**A：Jeanne:**   
She said Summer Getup---In other words, no danger.  
  
**A：Jeanne:**   
And on the bright side, look!  
  
**A：Jeanne:**   
We’ve changed into the two sisters in a swimsuit!  
Please, don’t you think it’s a little bit nice?  
  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hell no I don’t!  
You pretending to be a Big Sis this year too?!  
  
  
**A：Jeanne:**   
I’m not pretending. I **am** a Big Sis.  
I have [♂ three sisters and a little brother / ♀️ I have four little sisters]!  
  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
As usual, your intelligence plummets when you don that swimsuit, you octo-saint!
