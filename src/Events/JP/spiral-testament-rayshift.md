# Spiral Testimonial World - Lilim Harlot  
  
::: danger Unrefined Script Dump  
There are many miniscule changes in the script in the beginning and end depending on whether the player has finished Traum or LB7, or if they haven't.   
They are largely unimportant and only in the beginning or end, so please excuse the repeating dialogue if you encounter any. It will be refined at a later update.

## Prologue (Opening)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fujimaru reporting in!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's going on!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Kadoc:**   
Kadoc Zemlupus, reporting in! Please brief me on the situation!   
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai! Kadoc!   
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai!   
  
**Fou:**   
Foufou!   
  
**Sion:**   
Good, we've been waiting for you. There's not a lot of time, so I'll get straight to the point.   
  
**Sion:**   
There's an enemy attack. As we speak, Chaldea is under assault.   
  
**Gordolf:**   
A-an enemy attack!? Wh-who is the assailant!?   
  
**Gordolf:**   
First things first, prepare to counter-attack! Is the magical energy barrier holding up still!?   
  
**Nemo:**   
That's irrelevant. The attack is not coming from the outside.   
  
**Gordolf:**   
What are you saying...?   
  
**Da Vinci:**   
An unexpected reaction of large amounts of magical energy has been detected within Chaldea! The magical energy contamination is spreading rapidly!   
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Furthermore, Sion...this Saint Graph pattern...!   
  
**Sion:**   
Both TRISMEGISTUS II and the Observation Lens SHEBA have come to the same conclusion.   
  
**Sion:**   
Well, if I'm being honest, it's a real doozy!   
  
**Sion:**   
At present, a hostile existence is encroaching on Chaldea. Its true nature is&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Beast!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Nemo Professor:**   
Yuup! We've tried all sorts of things, but we can't stop the encroachmeeent.   
  
**Nemo Professor:**   
This is pretty dang bad!   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**   
This is Engine speaking! Hey! The contamination has spread all the way here!   
  
**Nemo Engineer:**   
If this place goes, we're all toast! You get that, don't you!?   
  
**Nemo Marine:**   
Waah, make it stop! It's going to swallow us whole!   
  
**Nemo Marine:**   
Evacuate! Evacuate!   
  
**Meunière:**   
Whoa, these guys are in serious trouble! What are we gonna do!?   
  
**Kadoc:**   
With the way things are, we have no choice but to counter-attack.   
  
**Kadoc:**   
Fujimaru, we need to strike at the source.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Roger!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'd better go!  
  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Well put. No need to discuss it further. In that case, I have some more bad news.   
  
**Da Vinci:**   
While we took readings throughout the ship, severe magical energy contamination was detected inside the coffins as well.   
  
**Mash:**   
What!? That means...the Beast got its hands on the Rayshift system...!   
  
**Kadoc:**   
Tch...! This is reeaaally really bad!   
  
**Holmes:**   
We have no choice but to mount a counter-attack. But these are anything but good circumstances.   
  
**Holmes:**   
Da Vinci. I wish to determine the extent of the facility's contamination. If my conjecture is correct&mdash;   
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Nothing sure gets by you. It's just as you fear, Holmes.   
  
**Da Vinci:**   
While checking for the same, severe magical energy contamination was detected inside the coffins as well.   
  
**Mash:**   
What!? That means...the Beast got its hands on the Rayshift system...!   
  
**Holmes:**   
As expected... Then our enemy is one familiar with Rayshifting?   
  
**Sion:**   
The current whereabouts of the Beast have been determined from the range of contamination.   
  
**Sion:**   
It goes without saying that Rayshifting is vital to our operations here in Chaldea.   
  
**Sion:**   
If you will, please repel the Beast. Whatever the cost!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Nodding furiously)  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Fujimaru, heading out!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fou:**   
Foouu...!   
  
**Gordolf:**   
Whoa!? What the blazes!?   
  
**Gordolf:**   
You mean to say someone as surly as our hazardous Bacon Eater has anything to fear!?   
  
**Gordolf:**   
This is no time to be rowdy! I'll share my emergency bacon with you if you just calm down!   
  
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry, Senpai, but it'll take some time to prepare the Ortenaus!   
  
**Mash:**   
Until then, please...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Leave it to me!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Worst case, I'll use a Command Spell!  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes! Senpai, Kadoc, best of luck!   
  
**Kadoc:**   
It's up ahead... Get ready!   
  
**Kadoc:**   
Our enemy is a Beast. Letting down your guard for even an instant could prove fatal...but I don't need to tell you that, do I?   
  
**Kadoc:**   
After all, you're probably the magus who has by far fought the most Beasts in all of human history!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll be fine!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm counting on you!  
  
  
---  
  
**Kadoc:**   
I never ever expected you to rely on me like that, but that's the kind of situation this is, I guess!   
  
**Kadoc:**   
What the...!? Speak of the devil!   
  
**Kadoc:**   
Something's coming...!   
  
**Mash:**   
Yes! Senpai, best of luck!   
  
**Da Vinci:**   
It's just up ahead! Be careful!   
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Your enemy is a Beast. You never know what trick they might pull...   
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Aah! Speak of the devil!   
  
**M：???:**  
&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This feeling...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
From where  
  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
The Saint Graph pattern is a perfect match! This is...!   
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Fujimaru! They might look very different, but the one in front of you now is&mdash;   
  
**M：???:**  
&mdash;!   
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Tiamat&mdash;the Divine Spirit manifested as a Beast in the Seventh Singularity!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Tiamat...!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She's pretty small now, though...  
  
  
---  
  
**O：Meunière:**   
Why is a Beast we defeated back all of a sudden!? How's that even possible!?   
  
**P：Sion:**   
No, that's not quite it. She isn't a Beast!   
  
**P：Sion:**   
Tiamat's Class has now been identified. Her class is... Alter Ego!   
  
**P：Sion:**   
That means the Beast is still afoot!   
  
**Kadoc:**   
Wh&mdash;   
  
**O：Meunière:**   
W-what are you even talking about!?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Do not loiter about so absent-mindedly, children!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did she just protect me?  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
Lift yourselves! The sixth Beast—Sodom's Beast— approaches!   
  
**Kadoc:**   
Hey, this is...!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Lift yourselves! The sixth Beast—Sodom's Beast— approaches!   
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Haa, what's this!?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A Demon God Pillar!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But something's different?  
  
  
---  
  
**Kadoc:**   
I've only seen the records in Chaldea's database, but yeah, it does seem to have taken a different form here.   
  
**Kadoc:**   
So what's up with this thing? Is it really a Demon God Pillar?   
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Not quite, the Saint Graph pattern is totally different from a Demon God Pillar! That thing is mimicking the Pillars, but is something else entirely!   
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Not quite, the Saint Graph pattern is totally different from a Demon God Pillar! That thing is mimicking the Pillars, but is something else entirely!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Oh no, you don't!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She protected me again!  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
Listen well. I am an alter ego of the Beast which you once defeated.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
There is no way I would allow you, who defeated me, to be beaten by another Beast.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Mother will not allow allow such slander as saying, “The second Beast is no match for the others”.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Another you elsewhere gained victory over Beast VI... but if you lose here, it will all have been in vain! Hmph!   
  
**Kadoc:**   
I have no idea what you're talking about, but... are you saying you're on our side now?   
  
**Kadoc:**   
No, that doesn't matter! Now's our chance, Fujimaru!   
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I don't really understand what she's trying to say, but regardless, it seems Tiamat isn't our enemy right now.   
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Mash is currently en route! Do your best until then!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Nodding)  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm counting on you all!  
  
  
---  
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Tiamat:**   
Know your place. A mother is very powerful.   
  
**Kadoc:**   
It's not nearly as strong as the Demon God Pillars in the records...   
  
**Kadoc:**   
Is it because it's a fake? Or&mdash;is it weakened?   
  
**Meunière:**   
That didn't seem as strong as the real Demon God Pillars, did it? Is it just because it's a fake?   
  
**Holmes:**   
Or perhaps&mdash;it is weakened?   
  
**Demon Pillar?:**  
Ca..... En.....   
  
**Tiamat:**   
...! Here it comes!   
  
**Demon Pillar?:**  
&mdash;It caNnot enD now! Not hEre!   
  
**Demon Pillar?:**  
It cannot end here! It cannot end like this!   
  
**Demon Pillar?:**  
At the bottom of that lifeless place&mdash; with no one attending my deathbed!   
  
**Kadoc:**   
Tch...! What the hell is happening!?   
  
**Da Vinci:**   
The magical energy signature is increasing!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There's a lot of Pillars!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But they still look wrong!  
  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, rather than a Demon God Pillar, they're more like... dragon heads&mdash;   
  
**Tiamat:**   
&mdash;Demon Beast Incarnadines! The underlings of Sodom's Beast!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
They have crossed over from the Testament World, into this Chaldea!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
They really don't know when to give up!   
  
**Demon Pillar?:**  
Fujimaru! If only... If we could only seize you...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh hell...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This won't end well!  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Senpai!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thanks, you saved me!  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes, sorry for keeping you! Mash Kyrielight, initiating combat!   
  
**Kadoc:**   
I'll pitch in with reinforcement magecraft. It might just provide peace of mind, but it's better than nothing!   
  
**Mash:**   
Thank you, Kadoc! Moreover, the one over there...   
  
**Mash:**   
Moreover, the one over there...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Mother.   
  
**Mash:**   
Huh?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Mother.   
  
**Mash:**   
Uhm...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Long time no see, Mash. Mother has come to help Chaldea out of trouble.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
An old enemy turning into an ally must be quite the unexpected development, no? Bolstering your odds, I guess one could call it.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's pretty common, actually.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Happens all the time.  
  
  
---  
  
**Kadoc:**   
(All the jokes aside, Tiamat is here to help Chaldea out of a crisis?)   
  
**Kadoc:**   
(Going by the records of the Seventh Singularity, you'd expect nothing less than her holding a grudge, to say the least...)   
  
**Mash:**   
Uhm...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Hmph. Typical Chaldea. Have you no concept of principle? You're too slovenly.   
  
**Mash:**   
Is that...Tiamat? The Tiamat we fought in the seventh Singularity? That Tiamat...?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Mash, watch yourself!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
There is much to talk about, but right now we must deal with the Demon Beast Incarnadines.   
  
**Mash:**   
S-sorry! I'll focus on the fight!   
  
**Demon Pillar?:**  
You will not escape, Fujimaru! You will not&mdash;   
  
**Mash:**   
I won't let you!   
  
**Demon Pillar?:**  
Not to escape! I am taking you with me!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Not happening...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Demon Beast Incarnadines&mdash;  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There's one more...!  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai&mdash;!   
  
## Ephemeral Landscape, Nameless Solitude  
  
**Narration:**   
No one is applauding. Because your deathbed has no audience.   
  
**Narration:**   
The people die one by one, burned by the flames of war. The soldiers on the battlefield collapse one by one.   
  
**Narration:**   
Some drowned swallowed by the stormy sea. Some died like dogs amidst the trash in a back alley.   
  
**Narration:**   
Rotting lives on dirty sickbeds. Lives reaped in the name of justice.   
  
**Narration:**   
Mankind prospers through the consumption of lives. Civilization, cities, are built upon piles of corpses.   
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;Atop many nameless deaths with no one present to watch their deathbeds.   
  
**Narration:**   
The city-eating Beast asks one question: “When all of creation disappears, who will be there to witness that end?”   
  
**Narration:**   
The city-eating Beast delivers one answer: “It is I, who feeds on civilization, the one capable of attending the world's deathbed.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“And at the very end, in a barren, lifeless void, I shall proclaim to myself, 'What a wonderful meal.'”   
  
**Narration:**   
This is surely evil, but also surely love.   
  
**Narration:**   
But in that event&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**   
Who will be there to attend the deathbed of the one girl left alone after the end of the world?   
  
## Section 1: Under the Depths of an Ancient Limbo  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I&mdash;  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Was attacked by the Pillar...  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where am I...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The ruins of a city...  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Communications aren't working.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Chaldea must be fine...  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They're hot...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Like something calling out to me...  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A theater...?  
  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
&mdash;Good grief. For me to do such a thing. My drive to survive makes me irredeemably vulgar.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Someone's there.  
  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
However, now you have no choice but to partake in the journey.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nero...?  
  
**A：Nero?:**  
Yours truly. That said, it is a name not appropriate for me right now.   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A kiddy Nero.  
  
**A：Nero?:**  
I was looked down on; treated like nothing more than a little girl. But that is simply the way of things.   
  
**A：Nero?:**  
As is clear to see, this is a larval body. Furthermore, it is one relegated to death. How unsightly; how shameful.   
  
  
---  
  
**A：Nero?:**  
I am the sixth of my kind: Beast VI/S. Call me Draco, should it please you.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Draco...  
  
**Draco:**   
It is a false name. Nevertheless, a convenient one.   
  
**Draco:**   
At last, I can see you firsthand. Would it be appropriate to say here is where we first meet? Heheh.   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So you're a Beast?  
  
**Draco:**   
My...do not tell me you have not conjectured the course of things here. You are an unexpectedly dull one, are you not?   
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
I am the perpetrator behind the assault on Chaldea, and the reason you were dragged to the lowest level of this limbo.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Sodom's Beast. That is my true nature, final Master of humanity.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...! (Put your guard up)  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are you going to do with me?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Do not frighten so. You'll make me snap at you out of reflex.   
  
**Draco:**   
I have sustained grave wounds. In this state, I could not so much as bully a babe, let alone kill one.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Seems so...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
By the looks of it...  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
The seven heads of the Demon Beast Incarnadines. That is the last remaining strength in Sodom's Beast within their final moments. I have no other course afforded to me than to wait for death...   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;At least, until just now. For it seems now that my misfortune has run its course.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait, what!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are those cheers? Or battle cries?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Peer outside. It should be a scene most familiar to you.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hold up, that flag...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why are they all...!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne d'Arc?:**  
Hear me! Heroic Spirits, mighty warriors who have gathered here!   
  
**Jeanne d'Arc?:**  
Though we may be rivals, or from completely different eras, we must stand together now!   
  
**Jeanne d'Arc?:**  
Not to prevent the Incineration of the Human Order, but to cut off the path for the Beast's contractor!   
  
**Jeanne d'Arc?:**  
My True Name is Jeanne d'Arc! In the name of the Lord, I shall become your shield!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Draco:**   
Those insufferable shadows. That they would go so far for a single Beast on the verge of death.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Servants in droves...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's just like in the Temple of Time.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Yes, you know it well. A miracle that all the same occurred in your Chaldea.   
  
**Draco:**   
Heroic Spirits gathered under the banner of a single Master. The wish to “save the world” made manifest.   
  
**Draco:**   
By feeding on a savior's desires, I was able to attain my true form as Sodom's Beast, but the end result is as you see.   
  
**Draco:**   
I was defeated by Chaldea&mdash; My power as a Beast was lost, and I was driven to take refuge in this very place.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Defeated by Chaldea?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Just so. A you different from yourself. A Chaldea different from your own.   
  
**Draco:**   
You need not comprehend. More important matters await.   
  
**Draco:**   
They will break through before long...   
  
**Kiyohime?:**  
Uncle! Uncle Vlad, please go easy now, umm!   
  
**Vlad III?:**  
I have every intention of holding back&mdash;   
  
**Vlad III?:**  
But you're doing a fine job evading my Noble Phantasm. Keep it up.   
  
**Kiyohime?:**  
Uncle!?   
  
**Elisabeth?:**  
Wow, uncle Vlad's merciless! Wowowowowow.   
  
**Elisabeth?:**  
Won't he end up Bey'ing us too? Are you sure this is ok?   
  
**Carmilla?:**  
There is no way Lord Vlad would blunder like that.   
  
**Carmilla?:**  
More importantly, we should provide support. We will exterminate the first Demon Beast Incarnadine here.   
  
**Elisabeth?:**  
Fine, fine! Let's do this&mdash;La~!   
  
**Draco:**   
Ghah...! Kh, the shell of an Incarnadine alone cannot do as much as halt their march...!   
  
**Jeanne d'Arc?:**  
Yes... This is undoubtedly a miracle.   
  
**Jeanne d'Arc?:**  
What you see before you are “Heroic Spirits” as they should have been!   
  
**Jeanne d'Arc?:**  
Now that we are free from the yoke of the Holy Grail's distortion and curse!   
  
**Jeanne d'Arc?:**  
We shall unite our forces to defeat you, Beast VI!   
  
**Marie?:**  
Yes, yes! This time, we can all get along and have a party!   
  
**Marie?:**  
Vive la France, Master of the Beast!   
  
**Marie?:**  
I'm glad I finally got the chance to greet you!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jeanne, and Marie...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But, something about them  
  
  
---  
  
**Martha?:**  
Rather rowdy for a party... Oh, I see. So that's how it is.   
  
**Martha?:**  
We are to hold a grand banquet on this triumphant day!   
  
**d'Eon?:**  
As you command, Your Highness! I shall bear the banner of the royal family's fleur-de-lis at this party!   
  
**d'Eon?:**  
O inauspicious red flower of evil. You have no place in the banquet of the Human Order!   
  
**Phantom?:**  
Dance, dance, Demon Beast Incarnadine. Dance the Danse Macabre before us&mdash;   
  
**Amadeus?:**  
Oh, the Phantom appears to be in good spirits. Now there's a rare sight!   
  
**Amadeus?:**  
And Maria appears much the same to me. Is there even a need to take this seriously then?   
  
**Jeanne Alter?:**  
I'm here too, you know...? Why am I on your side?   
  
**Gilles de Rais?:**  
Oh, Jeanne. Puffing up those beautiful cheeks of hers... could it be that she is sulking?   
  
**Jeanne Alter?:**  
Shut it! I'll immolate you!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Even Jeanne Alter...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They're all here to defeat a Beast?  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Guh...!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne Alter?:**  
   
  
**Draco:**   
No point in trying. You cannot converse with them.   
  
**Draco:**   
They are mere shadows. A reenactment of a battle already passed—a refrain.   
  
**Draco:**   
If it's for the sake of a dying Beast, shadows are more than sufficient. It is a case of bad taste without rival.   
  
**Draco:**   
Moreover, regard yourself. Should you not take this seriously, you will most likely simply...die.    
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're surrounded...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So much bloodlust...!  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
They approach! Summon your Servants!   
  
**Jeanne d'Arc?:**  
&mdash;!   
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Draco:**   
You have done well in making it thus far. Fine work, indeed.   
  
**Draco:**   
What? Your expression tells me you still do not realize why I have refrained from attacking you myself. How dull can you be?   
  
**Draco:**   
Look. Focus your senses. Truly feel it. Realize just what fate you are bound by.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
... (Focus your consciousness)  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This means...!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm connected to Draco!  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Ahahahaha! And so the last horse finally crosses the finish line! Well, you know how the classic line goes!   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;I answer you. You are this Beast's Master.   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Draco:**   
You and I were joined in a contract at the time of your abduction from Chaldea.   
  
**Draco:**   
And so, you are currently a Master with a Beast-class Servant at their disposal.   
  
**Draco:**   
To forge a contract with a Beast, even one reduced to a mere Alter Ego...   
  
**Draco:**   
You are quite something, are you not? Well, I guess humanity's final Master should be able to achieve as much! Hehe...ahahahahaha!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You just did that on your own!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So why did you abduct me...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Thanks to you, I was barely able to cling to life... Your magical energy was just enough to sustain me.   
  
**Draco:**   
However, it will not suffice. This is a temporary contract, so to speak.   
  
**Draco:**   
I require more energy from you. Should you indulge me, I can evict the Heroic Spirits gathering here.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nobody asked for that...!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And you think this helps me...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
You have no choice. As my contractor, they will hunt you, as well.   
  
**Draco:**   
What support you received from Chaldea has gone; your summons will only take you so far. Your only means of survival is to command this Beast of yours.   
  
**Draco:**   
Oh&mdash;and attempting to kill me would prove pointless. You are the Master of a Beast, recognized as part of the Evils of Humanity by the Heroic Spirits.   
  
**Draco:**   
The ones gathered here act purely on instinct. Even should I vanish, they shall continue to fight until they strike down the root of evil—you.   
  
**Draco:**   
Tch. We dawdled for too long, and now the second batch has turned up. Furthermore&mdash;   
  
**Boudica?:**  
&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
Boudica...   
  
**Boudica?:**  
Looks like it. I was your enemy once upon a time, but some things happened and, well, y'know. Now, take a look.   
  
**Boudica?:**  
The greatest allied army in history awaits your command, and so do the generals leading it!   
  
**Caesar?:**  
Hah hah hah hah! Julius Caesar has come to conquer! Rejoice, all of you!   
  
**Caligula?:**  
Ooooooooh...!! Rome...immortal...Demon Beast Incarnadine...DESTROY...!   
  
**Caligula?:**  
DESTROOOOOOY!!   
  
**Draco:**   
Uncle... And Caesar, too.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Everyone from the Second Singularity...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Even the Roman Army!  
  
  
---  
  
**Caesar?:**  
And we are not alone! O Heroic Spirits who have devoted yourselves to the training of the Divine Ancestor!   
  
**Caesar?:**  
Come forth!   
  
**Leonidas I?:**  
Nwaaaaaaaaaah! My body is rejuvenated through the strength of your war cries!   
  
**Leonidas I?:**  
Lancer, Leonidas I! Reporting for duty!   
  
**Draco:**   
Guh...! My head is splitting... This is unbearable...!   
  
**Draco:**   
Alliance and Imperial soldiers alike are pouring in. Will you be able to survive on your own?   
  
**Draco:**   
I would prefer you managed to avoid death. We are in this together, after all...!   
  
**Roman Army:**   
UUUUUUUURAAAAAAH! HAIL THE DIVINE ANCESTOR! HAIL THE EMPEROR!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We just barely got away somehow...!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But there's too many of them!  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Barely, indeed... Needless to say, your fortune is not about to turn for the better.   
  
**Draco:**   
As I said, you have no choice but to have me fight. You must make a decision.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Seems like you're right, Draco...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If this keeps up...  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
...!? Fujimaru!   
  
**Altera?:**  
&mdash;   
  
**El-Melloi II?:**  
This power is the same as the thing that caused my apprentice to lose control of her Holy Lance...   
  
**El-Melloi II?:**  
Certainly, you've endured it well.   
  
**Altera?:**  
Rome has spoken. All of you are good civilization.   
  
**Altera?:**  
And ![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png). Emperor ![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png). You...   
  
**Altera?:**  
Because you were kind to me under that distant sky...   
  
**Altera?:**  
This time, I shall protect... The me here and now shall destroy the Demon Beast Incarnadine.   
  
**Draco:**   
Ggh...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Draco!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You protected me!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Guh...! What...is the matter with you...!?   
  
**Draco:**   
You...are not someone who should meet their end here!   
  
**Draco:**   
Are you truly a Master of Chaldea, then&mdash;take one of the Beasts as your mount.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...!  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Fujimaru!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
&mdash;By my Command Spell, I order you!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Rise, Draco!  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Hehehe....! Hahahahahahahhahaha!   
  
**Draco:**   
That you would go so far as to exhaust a Command Spell! But lo and behold! Fujimaru!   
  
**Draco:**   
Come, a feast awaits! A terrible platter of rotten food, but I shall not demand extravagance here!   
  
**Draco:**   
The devourer of cities, Draco! I shall swallow it all!   
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Draco:**   
Phew...my migraine has died down. I feel a little better now.   
  
**Draco:**   
Now then, let me introduce myself once more.   
  
**Draco:**   
My name is Draco, the Beast of Sodom. My class&mdash;is Beast.   
  
**Draco:**   
For now, I am your Servant. Do take care of me&mdash;Master?   
  
**Draco:**   
Heh heh. Don't look so upset. It's unbecoming.   
  
**Draco:**   
I may be a tyrant, but I am a magnanimous one. If you have something to say, I will listen.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What exactly are you going to do...?  
  
**Draco:**   
Hmm. Well, that is the quandary. What should I do?   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thanks, I guess.  
  
**Draco:**   
Heh...there's no need for thanks. This is just how a Master and Servant work together, isn't it?   
  
**Draco:**   
But your consideration is commendable. I may be the Beast of Depravity, but I appreciate your honesty. Let us continue to work in good faith.   
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Thanks to you, I have recovered enough to be able to fight. But we're not out of danger yet.   
  
**Draco:**   
This body is still a larval one. And it's still a bit troublesome to deal with all the Heroic Spirits here while I'm still recovering.   
  
**Draco:**   
  
...How cheap.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
**Draco:**   
Do not stare at me so. That expression disgusts me.   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And you were acting so cocky...  
  
**Draco:**   
It's no boast...   
  
**Draco:**   
Had I the true form of the Beast, I would devour this entire area and everything in it.   
  
**Draco:**   
My defeat was by Chaldea's hands&mdash;not to these mere shadows of history.   
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Anyway! Now we break through the enemy's encirclement. This is where the real work begins, so get ready.   
  
**Draco:**   
After all, life-or-death battles are your stock in trade, aren't they? I look forward to seeing what you can accomplish, contractor.   
  
## Section 2: You are the Beast on the Battlefield (1/2)  
  
**Drake?:**  
Gold! Riches! I can't very well ignore those now, can I?   
  
**Drake?:**  
In all ages and cultures, such straightforward treasures have always been pillaged.   
  
**Drake?:**  
In other words, this is our forté. You're gonna have to hand it all over, your life included, got it?   
  
**Drake?:**  
I am fully aware of how impudent I'm being here, having just arrived and all. But it is what it is, no? After all, we're pirates!   
  
**Blackbeard?:**  
Alright, boyos! Keep pace with the hag&ndash; Drake's ship!   
  
**Blackbeard?:**  
Bold of you to steal a pirate's treasure! I don't care whether you're a demonic beast or a devil&ndash;   
  
**Blackbeard?:**  
Go and regret in hell ever having laid hands on this great pirate Blackbeard's treasure!   
  
**Drake?:**  
Well, well, looks like that oaf's all fired up! Listen up, boys, don't you dare fall behind!   
  
**Drake?:**  
If we end up crashing and burning before him, you lot are gonna be scrubbing the head in hell for a lifetime!   
  
**Drake?:**  
Cannons on the ready, Golden Hind!   
  
**Blackbeard?:**  
Prep those cannons, Queen Anne's Revenge!   
  
**Both:**   
Fireeeeeeee&mdash;!!!   
  
**Draco:**   
You dare fire on me!?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The false Demon God Pillar!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What were they called? Demon Beast Incarnadines!  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
It merely appears that way! It's nothing but an imitation devoid of soul! But&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
It still has solid substance! Hit it!   
  
**Blackbeard?:**  
Owieeee!   
  
**Atalante?:**  
Steer properly! We just rammed that pillar of flesh!   
  
**Blackbeard?:**  
Fine, fine! Cat-ears here has a rough way of treating her captain!   
  
**Draco:**   
We'll board them from here!   
  
**Draco:**   
Part of being a Beast is an insatiable hunger for riches. However, I am also a statesmen. Consequently...   
  
**Draco:**   
I will make an impromptu ruling. Piracy is to be punished with the hangman's noose!   
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Draco:**   
The successive battles are taking their toll... Looks like you're getting winded.   
  
**Draco:**   
Fortunately, this is an open area with no shortage of places to hide. Recover what magical energy you can.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Still, if this continues, we're going to be in trouble...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We've broken through, but what do we do now?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
We have to get out of this space somehow, but the exact method still eludes me.   
  
**Draco:**   
I was already beaten long ago. I struggled pathetically, and only made it this far by clinging to the thread of your existence.   
  
**Draco:**   
Ever since, I've been ad-libbing without a script. For now, we just keep up this pointless struggle.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
If this is a Singularity, then there has to be a Grail.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If we can get that, then  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Are you referring to this? Well, that's too bad.   
  
**Draco:**   
Your understanding is not exactly wrong, but not correct either.   
  
**Draco:**   
This is a world I created. A Testament World imitating the Incineration of the Human Order by Beast I.   
  
**Draco:**   
In this space, I recreated the seven Singularities and drew in the Chaldeas of many parallel worlds.   
  
**Draco:**   
And as Sodom's Beast, I drunk deep from the Holy Grail brimming with their collected “wishes”.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Chaldeas of parallel universes...  
  
**Draco:**   
Yes, that's right. My Authority is that of Nega-Messiah. The one who scorns, kills, and devours saviours.   
  
**Draco:**   
The Chaldea who defeated Beast I in this world. Its Master. The victors of many other worlds.   
  
**Draco:**   
The only “desires” potent enough to nurture my horns are the wishes to save the world.   
  
**Draco:**   
That is why this Singularity exists. That is the reason for this Holy Grail War. Your battles were most delectable.   
  
**Draco:**   
All Chaldeas and Masters fought splendidly, enough to sate my appetite. You should be proud.   
  
**Draco:**   
And finally, the last one falls into my maw. You bare your fangs, stepping over the husks of so many other Chaldeas.   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Imitating the Incineration of the Human Order?  
  
**Draco:**   
Yes, that's right. My Authority is that of Nega-Messiah. The one who scorns, kills, and devours the Saviour.   
  
**Draco:**   
The only “desires” potent enough to nurture my horns are the wishes to save the world.   
  
**Draco:**   
Therefore, I imitated you, and your battle against Beast I.   
  
**Draco:**   
The countless Holy Grail Wars waged by versions of you “Chaldeans” in this Testament World&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
But this little arcade is wholly based on you and the Chaldea you come from. Be proud of that.   
  
**Draco:**   
Yet in the last scene of the climax, I was struck by the Deus ex Machina. Hence my current pathetic state.   
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
I was laid low by Chaldea and lost my Authority as a Beast. Unfortunately, I no longer possess the Grail.   
  
**Draco:**   
The thing I hold in my hands will no longer grant wishes. It's nothing now but an empty chalice.   
  
**Draco:**   
This place is no longer a theatre or a dining hall. It is the twisted, distorted corpse of the Testament World.   
  
**Draco:**   
A garden where Heroic Spirits hunt down a Beast&mdash;A square for a public execution.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Stare at Draco)  
  
**Draco:**   
I like the look in your eyes. Correct. I wholly deserve to be hunted.   
  
**Draco:**   
But it cannot end here. I will once again rebloom into the form of Sodom's Beast.   
  
**Draco:**   
And you will be at my side when I do&mdash;but fear not. I will be sure to devour you whole.   
  
**Draco:**   
After all, I have to give due respect to the source material.   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Brood over that)  
  
**Draco:**   
Does it make you think? Then allow me to offer a suggestion.   
  
**Draco:**   
Regarding the Grail&mdash;this Testament World may be broken, but so long as it retains its form, it still serves as a source of magical energy.   
  
**Draco:**   
That holds true whether this is a Singularity or a Testament World. Therefore, someone besides me holds the Holy Grail.   
  
**Draco:**   
I suppose that's only natural. Perhaps it's one of the Heroic Spirits here to slay me. Either way the result is the same.   
  
**Draco:**   
You and I must make successive offerings of the Heroic Spirits, and take back the Holy Grail together. Hehe, I'll be relying on you.   
  
**Draco:**   
Do put your best foot forward for me. If you do well, I may see fit to grant you the Grail when this is over.   
  
**Draco:**   
My subjects are justly rewarded for their efforts, as I am a benevolent tyrant.   
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Does it anger you? Or perhaps I frighten you? Worry not, for I am your Servant. Your fangs.   
  
**Draco:**   
Whatever threats there may be, I vow to protect you from them. I may be a ferocious Beast, but I am also a noble one, no?   
  
**Draco:**   
Now let us go together, my Master&mdash;until the time when I rebloom into an Evil of Humanity.   
  
**Draco:**   
Time to go. We should avoid any unnecessary combat, but we may have to force our way through. I will let you decide.   
  
**Draco:**   
At least if you have a hand to progress with... No, it's nothing. Let's go.   
  
## Section 2: You are the Beast on the Battlefield (2/2)  
  
**Draco:**   
Hah...hah...hah... I am...exhausted...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hah...hah...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This is gruelling...  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
It seems like...now you finally know... how it feels...to suffer a raid...   
  
**Draco:**   
Still...we've broken through their encirclement for the time being. They probably won't be able to catch up with us for a time.   
  
**Draco:**   
We have to find a way up and out of this area while we still can&mdash;   
  
**B：???:**  
Nope, not happening. You're going down here.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They've caught up...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Doesn't he look kind of familiar?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
You...   
  
**B：???:**  
What...? That's harsh, I'm not a kid, y'know.   
  
**B：???:**  
Welp, we're just doin' our job. Guess luck just wasn't on your side!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But you are just a kid.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Though I don't think I'm really one to throw stones...  
  
  
---  
  
**B：???:**  
Hey, shut it! You're not that much older, ya know!   
  
**B：???:**  
Actually... You're a teenager, aren't you?   
  
**B：???:**  
No, you feel a little older. What exactly is your age?   
  
**Draco:**   
Boy... Where did you come from? You're not one of the shades here.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Really?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He definitely feels different from the others...  
  
  
---  
  
**B：???:**  
Calling me a kid again...but you're right. Well, if you get that, then you should know the answer, eh?   
  
**B：???:**  
I am Setanta! Servant of Chaldea!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're from Chaldea?  
  
**Setanta:**   
Not yours, but a different one. Weren't you told that?   
  
**Setanta:**   
I'm a Servant summoned by another Chaldea. Good to meet you, other Master!   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wait, wasn't Setanta...  
  
**Setanta:**   
Well, you probably know me better as Cú Chulainn...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Though it's a bit early for me to be the “Hound of Culann” or “The great hero of Ulster”.   
  
**Setanta:**   
So right now I'm just plain old Setanta!   
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Setanta...the childhood name of Cú Chulainn, was it?   
  
**Draco:**   
There was indeed a Servant by that name in the past.   
  
**Draco:**   
But I do not understand. Your Chaldea has already bested my attempt to destroy the Human Order.   
  
**Draco:**   
This broken Testament World should have no connection to your Chaldea. How are you here?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Yeah, about that...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
You may be able to escape the children, but there is no escaping your mother!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Beast II is here to punish Beast VI! Don't make a scene, now!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Alter Ego Tiamat!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
From back when Chaldea was attacked!  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
Fujimaru! Oh thank goodness you're safe. Mother is so relieved.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Just be a little more patient. I will fix everything by defeating the evil Beast.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Come, Setanta, my rambunctious child. Do your best with Mother.   
  
**Setanta:**   
I just got caught up in this! She forced me to come along!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Aww, my child is all raring to go right, even against a Beast! Mother is so proud of you~.   
  
**Setanta:**   
I'm mad at you! And I don't remember ever being brought up by you at all!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Oh boo, he's at his rebellious age. But all children go through this, after all, so I won't get mad at you.   
  
**Draco:**   
You're a former Beast, but you just do whatever you want, don't you...?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Eh?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you really one to talk?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Of course.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
&ndash;Beautiful eyes with no hesitation in them.  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
I actually don't have a problem with it. She may be weakened, but your partner there is still a Beast.   
  
**Setanta:**   
It's a Heroic Spirit's duty to slay them. I'm gonna have to take her head.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Hurry up and come here, Fujimaru.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Just leave everything to Mother.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But I'm contracted to Draco...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Taking Draco out won't fix things here.  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
It's true... This child does not carry the Grail.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Defeating Beast VI now will not bring this world to its end. So long as the contractor lives, her resurrection is a possibility.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Fujimaru will continue to be a target. Mmrgh...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
But don't worry. Mother will protect you.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Isn't that a little slapdash...?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
A mother is strong, you know.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Either way I can't say I disagree with her. We'll help you get back to Chaldea, and cross that bridge when we get to it.   
  
**Setanta:**   
That Beast is the most important thing right now. We can't just leave her be.   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Tiamat's right...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But still...  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;This is ridiculous.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Draco's claws...on my throat...!  
  
  
---  
  
**F：Draco:**   
I told you, you're coming with me.   
  
**G：Tiamat:**   
Get away from Fujimaru!   
  
**H：Setanta:**   
Just what I'd expect from you...   
  
**F：Draco:**   
Stop there, boy&mdash;or would you rather see if your sword is faster than my talons, hm?   
  
**H：Setanta:**   
That's a bit cliche, don't you think?   
  
**F：Draco:**   
Blame your being summoned with an immature Saint Graph. Things would be different if you had access to your cursed, causality-reversing spear.   
  
**G：Tiamat:**   
&mdash;Beast VI. Are you trying to upset me?   
  
**F：Draco:**   
When I regain my true form, I'll play with you as much as you like, Beast II.   
  
**G：Tiamat:**   
&mdash;   
  
**F：Draco:**   
....Tch.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Draco...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Trembling...)  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
Gh... What now!?   
  
**Sakata Kintoki?:**  
I'm gonna have to be an electric blade. I can hear the voices calling me.   
  
**Sakata Kintoki?:**  
“There's too much bitterness to bear.” That's what countless voices shouted the moment the world was burned.   
  
**Sakata Kintoki?:**  
I wonder how many things they would've wanted to do? A mom making dinner, a kid who wanted to play the day after.   
  
**Sakata Kintoki?:**  
I've got no idea... It's enough to make me grind my teeth.   
  
**Sakata Kintoki?:**  
I don't know what's between the ears of whoever doesn't get how important all those things are!   
  
**Sakata Kintoki?:**  
Before you start talking about humanity's future, Draco, I'm gonna smash your stupid nature back to normalcy!   
  
**Sakata Kintoki?:**  
For every day that's gone to waste since this place was burned to ash,   
  
**Sakata Kintoki?:**  
I'm gonna kick your ass for everyone that couldn't make the most of them!   
  
**Sakata Kintoki?:**  
I'm Kintoki, Sakata Kintoki. One of Raikou's Four Heavenly Kings who heard those sounds!   
  
**Lancelot?:**  
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)!   
  
**Draco:**   
The shadows caught up with us! Now, of all times...!   
  
**Sakata Kintoki?:**  
Let's go, buddy! Restrain the demons and smash the rakshasas!   
  
**Sakata Kintoki?:**  
Split the heaven and earth, tearing up space and Demon Beast Incarnadines with it! Hell yeah, now here's the treasured blade of fiery lightning coming to kill you dead!   
  
**Sakata Kintoki?:**  
&mdash;The one and only Golden Spark!   
  
**Draco:**   
Get back, Fujimaru!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Draco!  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Ggh...! Dispersing sparks&mdash;I want to praise the flavor, but...!   
  
**Draco:**   
Nothing but a pale imitation! There's no bite to them, the fools!   
  
**Setanta:**   
(Did she just protect the Master...?)   
  
**Sakata Kintoki?:**  
OOOOooooOOH!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Kintoki! Any more of this, and Mother will get mad at you!   
  
**Sakata Kintoki?:**  
&mdash;   
  
**Lancelot?:**  
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)!   
  
**Draco:**   
There's no reasoning with these shades! You must fight!   
  
**Draco:**   
You don't want Master to die, do you!?   
  
**Setanta:**   
What the heck are you talkin' about!? ...Shit, guess we gotta do this!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Naughty children are to be punished!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Setanta:**   
Okay, they're out, for now.   
  
**Jeanne d'Arc?:**  
&mdash;   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Ugh... We're trapped...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We got surrounded again...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are they respawning?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
The shadows' numbers do not decrease... Damned be them. I shan't fall here...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Fujimaru! Come with your mother!   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Draco...  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's been protecting me...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
at every turn here.  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
What are you hesitating for! Hurry!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Hey! I won't last forever here!   
  
**Draco:**   
...Fujimaru.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
My Command Spells are heating up again...  
  
  
---  
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;Look above.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Whose voice was that?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
To the stars...  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
What the hell?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
A madder glow&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;The sky's ladder.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
&mdash;Twilight Ladder.  
  
  
---  
  
**D：???:**  
Wryaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Buzz off, cannon fodder! Eat some poison mushrooms!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's throwing mushrooms with great intensity?!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can't see! It's all mushroom spores everywhere!  
  
  
---  
  
**D：???:**  
PRINCEPS, PRINCEPS, PRINCEPS! Hurry, hurry, hurry! Up the ladder!   
  
**Draco:**   
You're...Locusta!?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Yes! Poison maker to you, Emperor Nero! I've manifested here under the Assassin class!   
  
**Locusta:**   
We must escape to the upper levels! We don't have much time! EAT THOSE MUSHROOMS, WRAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!   
  
**Setanta:**   
WHAAAH!? Watch out not to hit us too!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Shut up! You're with the enemy, bonehead! Swallow a toxic mushroom and die!   
  
**Draco:**   
Fujimaru! Come with us!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Draco...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Nod)  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
Huh? Fujimaru!? Why!?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Ugh! You ain't running from me!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Setanta!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Kh&ndash;UOOOOOH!   
  
**Draco:**   
Fine! Go!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Attention, please! Taking off!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's rising...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
to the stars  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
I made it in time... But what's going on? I'm so lost.   
  
**Locusta:**   
I've been inside this thing since I got summoned here... But, but, nothing makes me happier than seeing the Princeps safe and sound!   
  
**Draco:**   
The Twilight Ladder...?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeps...?   
  
**Draco:**   
Fujimaru, we've found our path to the stars. Seven Imitation Singularities await us.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Seven Singularities...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Just like in Goetia's Incineration of the Human Order...  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
This broken Testament World is a spiral staircase made piling the seven Imitation Singularities atop each other...   
  
**Draco:**   
We shall climb this spiraling Testament World together&mdash;so I may rebloom as a Beast once more.   
  
## Section 3: Tracing a Path with Endless Skies  
  
**Locusta:**   
Sorry for keeping you waiting, Princeps! Here's Locusta's special mushroom dish!   
  
**Draco:**   
Hm. My thanks.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's a lot of mushrooms.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are these safe to eat?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Well, poison doesn't work on you anyway.   
  
**Draco:**   
Mushrooms are to be offered to the gods. Be grateful and weep at this great honor.   
  
**Locusta:**   
You are Emperor Nero's Master, after all! That makes you hugely important to me!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Please, eat as much as you want! Go ahead and eat them all!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Mushrooms are quite good for you. They're low in calories, but rich in vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber.   
  
**Locusta:**   
They also have ingredients like this or that which expand your awareness and uplift you to a state of enlightenment.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Whoa...the colors are so backlit and vibrant... It's like I'm being embraced by the universe and becoming part of something amazing...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are these really safe to eat...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Master is a friend, a pal, a chum, a “Hey bro, whazzup” kinda [♂ guy /♀️ gal], so [♂ he /♀️ she]'s welcome...   
  
**Locusta:**   
But what the heck do YOU think you're doing, showing your face here! Go on, scram!   
  
**B：Setanta:**   
...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hard to believe he held on to the Ladder...  
  
  
---  
  
**B：Setanta:**   
I'm trying my best to not get thrown off my game here... It was actually pretty good training.   
  
**B：Setanta:**   
I said I wasn't going to let the Beast get away from me. Besides, my job is to keep you safe, Master.   
  
**E：Locusta:**   
Princeps, let me throw him out with the rest of the trash!   
  
**B：Setanta:**   
Shut the hell up, Shrooms.   
  
**E：Locusta:**   
I don't have any mushrooms for you. Go find another dog to eat, doggo.   
  
**B：Setanta:**   
Oh, now you've really gone and said it.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Now, now...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Whoa there...  
  
  
---  
  
**F：Draco:**   
Stop this. We're in the middle of a meal.   
  
**H：Locusta:**   
Ah, Princeps! Please, have some more!   
  
**I：Setanta:**   
You're being awfully carefree, Beast VI...   
  
**Draco:**   
Nom nom... Setanta, was it? If you want to save Master, then you have no choice but to assist me.   
  
**I：Setanta:**   
...You're still on about that?   
  
**Draco:**   
Just listen. You too, Fujimaru.   
  
**Draco:**   
As you are aware, Fujimaru and myself are currently bound by contract.   
  
**Draco:**   
So long as you are contracted to a Beast, the Heroic Spirits gathered in this Testament World will keep coming after you.   
  
**Draco:**   
But&mdash;I am willing to break this contract.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What do you mean?  
  
  
---  
  
**I：Setanta:**   
You can do that? Then hurry up and get on with it!   
  
**Draco:**   
I told you to listen. Don't make me repeat myself... you're giving me a migraine.   
  
**Draco:**   
This contract is a rather special one. If anything, it is closer to a curse. Right now, we are bound to each other.   
  
**Draco:**   
I cannot break it of my own volition&ndash;at least, not if things remain as they are.   
  
**I：Setanta:**   
What is that supposed to mean...?   
  
**Draco:**   
It would require a Beast's special trait of Independent Manifestation. After all, a Beast is essentially something that can manifest itself without support.   
  
**Draco:**   
I can sever our contract through use of this power. Not a bad idea, if I do say so myself.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But in order to do that...  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Indeed. I would have to regain my power as a Beast.   
  
**I：Setanta:**   
So we're right back to square one!   
  
**Draco:**   
How can you say that? My objective is clear now. This is the most amount of progress so far.   
  
**Draco:**   
When I once again awaken as Sodom's Beast, there will be nothing more to bind us together.   
  
**Draco:**   
All that will be left is for the two of us to settle our differences. I planned to devour [♂ him /♀️ her] from the start anyway.   
  
**I：Setanta:**   
This is a load of bull... You've been manipulating us from the start, haven't you?   
  
**I：Setanta:**   
Master...if you're all right with it, I can end this right here and now.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Haah? There's no way I'll let you do that.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Stand down, Setanta.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're not going to fight here.  
  
  
---  
  
**I：Setanta:**   
...You're really going to just go along with what a Beast says? There's no way we can be sure she won't stab us in the back.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe, but...  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't think Draco will break her word.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She's got a strong sense of responsibility.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
**Setanta:**   
(I don't get it... She's definitely serious about keeping Master safe.)   
  
**Setanta:**   
(But shouldn't that be obvious, since she's getting all her magical energy from [♂ him /♀️ her] anyway...?)   
  
**Setanta:**   
(And yet...she's somehow acting like a respectable Servant&mdash;)   
  
**Setanta:**   
(Sigh)   
  
**Setanta:**   
Trusting anyone you come across, hero or antihero... You really are just like that other Master.   
  
**Setanta:**   
You're gonna get burned by that one day.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Well, I'll follow your lead here, Master.   
  
**Setanta:**   
I may be from another Chaldea, but I'm your Servant now. Feel free to tell me anything.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nice to be working with you, Setanta.  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Uh...are you done talking now?   
  
**L：Locusta:**   
# Excellent. # Now do battle with me.   
  
**M：Setanta:**   
Wait, what now!?   
  
**L：Locusta:**   
Oh right, I haven't introduced myself... I'm Locusta.   
  
**L：Locusta:**   
Now then, let's start the Locusta Trial Quest.   
  
**M：Setanta:**   
Don't just take things in the direction you want!   
  
**L：Locusta:**   
You and I are enemies now.   
  
**M：Setanta=spot:**   
Don't we normally become friends at this point!?   
  
**Draco:**   
You'll make too much of a ruckus here. Go do it in the next room.   
  
**Locusta:**   
All right, Master! Let's have a cook-off!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Setanta:**   
She really went and poisoned me, that wench... Damn it, I'm still reeling...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you alright?  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
I just wish you'd have stopped it!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I got caught up in the flow and all.  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Pleased to make your acquaintance, I am Locusta! My Class is Assassin. In life, I was a poisoner in the service of Emperor Nero!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A poisoner...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And in the service of Nero...  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
You can hardly imagine that from the Nero Claudius you know, yes. But she speaks the truth. The royal court is dyed in conspiracies.   
  
**Draco:**   
Many such enemies were killed.   
  
**Draco:**   
The splendorous life of the Emperor was, in fact, colored by blood and poison.   
  
**Draco:**   
Locusta served me well. I can hardly claim to know anyone who befits the image of a poisoner more than she.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Woo-hoo! The Princeps has praised me... I am awash with delight!   
  
**Locusta:**   
So as long as you remain the Master of Emperor Nero, I shall serve you with all my being! I look forward to doing so!   
  
**Setanta:**   
About that obsession with mushrooms, though...   
  
**Draco:**   
Oh...that would be because mushrooms are a favorite food of mine. I'll have you know they are a divine delicacy.   
  
**Draco:**   
Well, my foster father&mdash;the late Emperor Claudius wasn't too fond of them. Haha.   
  
**Locusta=spot:**   
E-hee-hee-he...   
  
**E：Setanta:**   
Wasn't too fond of 'em, huh... Give me a break, such wiles aren't really my thing.   
  
**E：Setanta:**   
...Never mind. More importantly, we should discuss what comes next.   
  
**E：Setanta=spot:**   
You say you'll revert to your true form as a Beast, but how exactly are you planning on doing that?   
  
**F：Draco:**   
Oh, that's what this journey is all about.   
  
**F：Draco=spot:**   
We will traverse the seven Simulated Singularities piled up in a spiral&mdash;this Spiral Testament World&mdash;and recover the Demon Beast Incarnadines.   
  
**E：Setanta=spot:**   
Demon Beast Incarnadines? Weren't you using them in battle?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It was only appearing that way...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's what she said, along those lines.  
  
  
---  
  
**F：Draco:**   
The Demon Beast Incarnadines I wield in battle now are merely husks lacking any essence.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
The real Incarnadines were sealed within the seven Simulated Singularities, right after they snatched you from Chaldea.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
The seven-headed, ten-horned beast described in the Apocalypse is none other than I. And the Incarnadines themselves are the heads of Sodom's Beast.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
The release of the Demon Beast Incarnadines is necessary for me to rebloom into Sodom's Beast.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
And these Demon Beast Incarnadines are sealed?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who the heck did that?  
  
  
---  
  
**F：Draco:**   
Needless to say, it's the handiwork of the Heroic Spirits summoned to hunt me. However, they are no mere shadows like what we encountered earlier.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
They are the Servants who guard the seals of the Demon Beast Incarnadines, the ones who lord over each floor of the Simulated Singularities.   
  
**F：Draco=spot:**   
Well... I suppose we ought to call them Floor Guardians.   
  
**E：Setanta=spot:**   
So you want us to beat them and free the Demon Beast Incarnadines? I'm not really feeling it... but I guess we've got no other choice.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
Right now, the Ladder is pointing us to the Seventh Imitation Singularity.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
From your perspective, Fujimaru, we'd be travelling the seven Singularities in reverse.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
From the Seventh Singularity&mdash;  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So we're repeating the battle from Babylonia...  
  
  
---  
  
**F：Draco:**   
The Seventh Imitation Singularity is different from the one you're familiar with. As if I'd ever let another Beast manifest.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
The Seventh Imitation Singularity is&mdash;the Golden City of Babylon. A supercivilization that has reached the zenith of its splendour, one unlike any other in human history.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
In which case, the Floor Guardian would be the King of Babylon&mdash;Nebuchadnezzar II.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nebuchadnezzar II?  
  
**F：Draco:**   
He was the King of Babylon sometime around 7th century BC, and&mdash;someone who does not exist in 27th century BC.   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's the one from the Babylonian captivity, right?  
  
**F：Draco:**   
So you DO know a little of him. Indeed, he was the King of Babylon during the 7th century BC.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
He's someone who's not supposed to exist in the 27th century BC&mdash;in the Seventh Singularity, that is.   
  
  
---  
  
**F：Draco:**   
He is the result of Nebuchadnezzar II's soul being implanted into a clone of the King of Heroes, Gilgamesh.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
He truly is the Super Babylonian Uruk. That's the true nature of Nebuchadnezzar II.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
And he's also the consort of yours truly, Bewitching Queen Draco.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Super...Babylonian?  
  
**F：Draco:**   
Needless to say, he's produced by yours truly. Babylon is a Singularity I built with my own hands.   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Husband!?  
  
**F：Draco:**   
Well, more of a sham marriage. The Seventh Singularity was one I produced with my own hands.   
  
  
---  
  
**F：Draco:**   
And it was by Nebuchadnezzar II's hands that it turned into a golden city, overflowing with greed.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
You would do well to enjoy it. This fruit worthy of a platter on my table, that is.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
This city which stands peerless in human history at the zenith of its prosperity.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The zenith of its prosperity...  
  
**F：Draco:**   
That's right. For that is the dish that I&ndash;the city-eating beast, Sodom's Beast, will feast upon.   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I mean, Olympus was amazing and all, but...  
  
**F：Draco:**   
You mean that Lostbelt? How ridiculous. Don't lump this in with the likes of that.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
A city built by the gods&mdash;I see, that must have been beautiful indeed. All the more so if Venus herself was present.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
But even if it did reach the zenith of prosperity, it is still nothing more than amusement for the gods. Playing house is all they're doing there.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
The embodiment of humanity's desires. That is the true nature of a city.   
  
**F：Draco:**   
A soulless city, bereft of desire&mdash;is nothing more than an empty temple.   
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The zenith of prosperity...  
  
**F：Draco:**   
That's right. For that is the dish that I&mdash;the city-devouring beast, Sodom's Beast, will feast upon.   
  
  
---  
  
**F：Draco:**   
I wonder what Nebuchadnezzar II would feel if he stood in my path?   
  
**F：Draco:**   
Perhaps the hatred of having his flesh and soul toyed with? Or perhaps the lamentation of having failed to reach godhood?   
  
**F：Draco:**   
Surely he wouldn't burn with righteous indignation like one of those Heroic Spirits, would he?   
  
**F：Draco:**   
That is fine, I shall forgive it. I shall at least proffer laughter at the sight of that.   
  
**Setanta:**   
The Ladder stopped...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Emperor Nero, we have arrived!   
  
**Draco:**   
Now feast your eyes upon this Imitation Singularity, this emulated hell. The Floor Guardian awaits us.   
  
**Draco:**   
It is by smiting him and releasing the Demon Beast Incarnadines that we will reach the higher levels&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
What is this...?   
  
**Draco:**   
# This isn't how it's meant to be!   
  
## Section 4: Critical Tourist City: Babylon (1/2)  
  
**Locusta:**   
What a magnificent city...! Truly one of the Princeps' masterpieces...!   
  
**Draco:**   
It is not one of mine.   
  
**Setanta:**   
It was kinda surprising...   
  
**Draco:**   
No, it's no surprise.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's like Luluhawa or Vegas.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Those kind of places.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Do you want me to start crying!? Is that it!? I'm really a handful when I'm in a bad mood!   
  
**Setanta:**   
You're always a handful.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Aaah! Emperor Nero's tantrums are one of her greatest charm points, you philistine!   
  
**Setanta:**   
And now the fan club starts up again!   
  
**Setanta:**   
But seriously, what is this? Why did the Seventh Singularity turn into a tourist trap?   
  
**Draco:**   
Now that I think about it...it's probably the Floor Guardian's fault.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You mean Nebuchadnezzar II?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's that much of a prankster?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
What the hell is this rip-off!? Is this supposed to be mocking me!?   
  
**Draco:**   
I will see just reprobation for this jest! I'll tear that Floor Guardian to shreds!   
  
**Locusta:**   
But where exactly is this...Floor Guardian, Princeps?   
  
**Draco:**   
If he really is the king of Babylon, then he should be on the throne of that gigantic ziggurat...   
  
**E：Locusta:**   
Over there?   
  
**D：Setanta:**   
...That's it.   
  
**Draco:**   
You continue to mock me...! Attend me, Fujimaru!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait up!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Aaah, here we go!  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Yeah, a raid! Throw the bastard who destroyed our territory into the Gulf of Babylon and feed him to the sea monsters!   
  
**Babylonian Soldier:**   
Welcome to the Ziggurat Hotel.   
  
**Babylonian Soldier:**   
I am very sorry, but presently, our hotel is fully booked&mdash;   
  
**M：Draco:**   
Who constructed this city!?   
  
**Babylonian Soldier:**   
Gyah!   
  
**Babylonian Soldier:**   
Please keep your voices down! You are disturbing our other guests!   
  
**N：Locusta:**   
Hahahaha! I'll turn this place into a mushroom plot!   
  
**Babylonian Soldier:**   
Please calm down, Miss! Miss!?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Whoa... You really don't hold back, Shrooms.   
  
**J：Babylonian Soldier:**   
Waaah, it's a customer complaint from hell! Form up, quick!   
  
**Setanta:**   
They're coming out in droves! Goddammit, let's get this over with, Master!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**???:**  
&mdash;What's with all this noise? What are you doing?   
  
**Babylonian Soldier:**   
Mr. Owner!   
  
**Draco:**   
So you're the Floor Guardian...   
  
**???:**  
Good grief... Today's supposed to be my day off.   
  
**Draco:**   
You're&mdash;not Nebuchadnezzar II. You're...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
King Gilgamesh!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Gorgeous-P!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
So you've arrived, Chaldeans. I see you're sticking your nose in trouble as usual.   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
But I won't be helping you. While you aren't to blame for this, it is still a fact that this all started with you.   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Even if this is the work of another Chaldea, it's only natural that you see it through to the end yourself.   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
But, well, don't act so formal. At the end of the day, this is just your usual chaotic merrymaking. Just act the fool as you usually do.   
  
**Draco:**   
Gilgamesh, you say...? What happened to Nebuchadnezzar II?   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hah. He may be a hopelessly foolish king, but even he won't play along with this kind of farce. After all, he's not that shameless.   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
It is out of spite that I assumed the role of this so-called Floor Guardian. Normally, it falls to the shepherd to take care of a beast.   
  
**Draco:**   
This ridiculous state that Babylon is in... Are you mocking me!?   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
# Of course I am, you fool!   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
What's this farce all about, Beast!? Do you intend on killing me with second-hand embarrassment?   
  
**Draco:**   
Wha... Wha...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
...   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
It is only natural that I respond in kind to a farce &mdash;Fujimaru!   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
If you wish to free the Demon Beast Incarnadine, you must first complete the missions I have in mind for you!   
  
**Setanta:**   
...Missions?   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Needless to say, there's no deeper meaning behind it! I'm just messing with you!   
  
**Setanta:**   
He just said the quiet part out loud...   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
This should at least rid me of my boredom. Even if I have to play along with this buffoonery in his stead.   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
And if you call yourself a Master, why don't you teach that Beast there a trick or two! End of story!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We got the bum's rush...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He said something about missions.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Hey...she's gone totally quiet on us for a while now. What's the matter?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Is it another headache? Would you like to have some mushrooms, Princeps?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Do mushrooms even help with headaches...?   
  
**Locusta:**   
I looked it up on social media.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Check your facts.   
  
**Draco:**   
Enough...don't kick up a fuss. I'm simply too angry for words, that's all.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Hey...the Servants here banded together to take you out, didn't they?   
  
**Setanta:**   
So what's with this attitude? You really don't seem interested in taking this seriously at all.   
  
**Draco:**   
As if I know! I'd like to ask that myself!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's Gorgeous-P's handiwork, after all.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(He seemed to know something...)  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
But as long as he's the Floor Guardian, the rules he's made are laws.   
  
**Draco:**   
It doesn't look like we'll be able to avoid completing the missions.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Does a Floor Guardian hold that much juice? Where are they getting their magical energy resources from?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Since it's a Singularity, I'm guessing a Holy Grail?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
The Spiral Testament World is vast. If there's something other than a Holy Grail capable of supporting the world itself...well, I could venture a guess or two.   
  
**Draco:**   
It would be the sealed Demon Beast Incarnadines. They would be used as resources for the Singularity while, at the same time, diminishing the power of Sodom's Beast&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
Vexing as that may be, it does add up. It would be difficult to free the Demon Beast Incarnadine without abiding by his rules.   
  
**Locusta:**   
But what exactly are we supposed to do in this mission? He didn't really tell us anything.   
  
**???:**  
&mdash;Hehe. That's where I come in!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Hm? And you are...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Heya, long time no see, Big [♂ Bro /♀️ Sis]! I'm everyone's little sister, Lady Avalon.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
LA!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Merlin's little sister!  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
What are YOU doing here...?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Hmm?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Sorry, but I think you've got the wrong person. This is our first time meeting each other.   
  
**Setanta:**   
What are you on about? I saw you at that other Chaldea, Mer&ndash;   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
It's Lady Avalon.   
  
**Setanta:**   
No, you're Mer&ndash;   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
I'm Lady Avalon. Your big sis from paradise, and everyone's little sister.   
  
**Setanta:**   
...What??   
  
**Setanta:**   
Ah, I don't really give a crap anymore... I'll leave the rest to you, Master...   
  
**Locusta:**   
You seem tired. Would you like to have a poisonous mushroom?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Why would I?   
  
**Locusta:**   
I figured living would be a pain.   
  
**Setanta:**   
If that's the case, then it's your fault.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Death is salvation... Now, accept my toxic love...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Are you some kind of villain with shoddy character development?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
The king has made an unreasonable demand of you, no? That's what the looks on your faces is telling me.   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Oh dear, that lady over there is a rather quiet one, isn't she? I wonder if she's shy?   
  
**Draco:**   
What are you doing here...Beast of the Planet?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Hmm? I have no idea what you're talking about.   
  
**Draco:**   
So you intend to mock me too?   
  
**Draco:**   
&ndash;Where's the Beast-hunting Holy Swordsman? He must be here too, no? To slay me, that is.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Nope. I didn't call him this time. I mean, using the Holy Sword on a powerless Beast? Overkill much?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Even I am just a bystander now, I only reached this Singularity just before you did.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
But let's see, I can at least give you a tour. Alright now, come over here.   
  
**Draco:**   
Hey! Don't go deciding things on your own volition!   
  
**Draco:**   
I have no time to play games with you. I need to end this farce as swiftly as possible...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
&mdash;Draco, you shouldn't rush things like that.   
  
**Draco:**   
What are you talking about...?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
The ending is still a long way off.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
We can afford to enjoy this ephemeral dream, can't we?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Well, in my case, there's no significant difference between dreams and reality!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are you even saying?  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Just that I'm glad you're my companion on this journey, Big [♂ Bro /♀️ Sis]!   
  
## Section 4: Critical Tourist City: Babylon (2/2)  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Great job, team. We completed the King's missions!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Everyone... Cheers!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Cheeeers!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No alcohol, most of us are minors.  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
Well, I'm awfully tired.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Already? Want a poison mushroom to put an end to it?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Do you hate me or something? Because I do hate you.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
How did you like the hijinks, Draco? Not bad, right?   
  
**Draco:**   
I detest futility... This is not a place I desire.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
What a troublesome girl. I'd expect the Beast of Depravity to know how to let loose.   
  
**Draco:**   
I told you before that we are incompatible existences. Our tastes are fatally discordant.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
I agree. Because I want these dreamlike moments to last forever.   
  
**Draco:**   
Your dreams are indolent. They appetize me not.   
  
**Draco:**   
The theater's curtains are long since lowered, and there is no one left in the audience&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
It'd be miserable to find an actor refusing to leave the stage under such circumstances.   
  
**Draco:**   
And for a play so cheap as to rely on a deus ex machina, no less.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
You really are a&mdash;   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Well, you're just a specific facet of a person, so there's no way around it. Yeah.   
  
**Draco:**   
You should be allied with my slayers. Do you intend to let Fujimaru die from your inaction?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Didn't I just tell you I'm only an onlooker? I'm just here to see where this story goes.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Proceed as you desire. I really hope the spiral takes you to the conclusion you wish for.   
  
**Draco:**   
Hmph, nonsense. ...Fujimaru.   
  
**Draco:**   
Be not distracted by all the merrymaking. Our duel with the Floor Guardian is at hand.   
  
**Draco:**   
Gorgeous-P, I shall sink your mockery of a city to the bottom of the ocean!   
  
## Section 5: Both the Focal Point and the Tuning are Out of Alignment  
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fuahahaha! Well done conquering the 99 floors of Ziggurat Hotel and making it here! I commend you!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Haah...haah...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Climbing all 99 floors by stairs...  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
You're just making it harder than it needs to be...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Haha... I guess physical labor is a bit outside my wheelhouse too...   
  
**Locusta:**   
H-Have some of these energy-boosting poisonous mushrooms... They'll push you right over the edge...   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
You do a decent impression of clowns. For your reward, I'll give you your judgement personally.   
  
**Draco:**   
So you look down on us to the last...   
  
**Draco:**   
Now, cry in pain and beg for forgiveness. Moan in despair and pray for salvation in death.   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hmph. You really are just a dumb beast if you still don't comprehend my hotel's boundless hospitality.   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
I shall break you like the beast you are. Come and fight!   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;!   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
WHAAAAAAAT&mdash;!?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, who is it now!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
# YOUR MOTHER!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I've finally caught up to you! Now think about what you've done, Beast VI!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Tiamat!?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Setanta! What are you doing with Beast VI!?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
You had better explain yourself, young man!   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Wait a second... You, fun-sized Tiamat.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Ah. Gilgamesh the 2.5th.   
  
**Locusta:**   
2.5th?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
2.5th?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Huh?  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
Ah yeah... It's a little complicated...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Actually...back in the Seventh Singularity, Nebuchadnezzar II called himself GIlgamesh II.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
He turned out to be a clone of Gilgamesh. He wasn't a successor, so “II” couldn't really&mdash;   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Ahaha! It really is convoluted, isn't it!   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Tiamat! You're doing this on purpose, aren't you!   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fine... Wait, no. It's not fine.   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
But I'm willing to put that aside for the moment.   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Tiamat, what manner of jest is this? Why involve yourself in this nonsense?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Hm? Mother only wants to save her child from the nasty Beast.   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Astounding... Do you really think this is going to spiral into an actual crisis for Chaldea?   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
There is a limit to how absurd a farce can become. It ceases to be amusing when you take it this far.   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
I've lost all interest in this. Do whatever you please from now on.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
...??? Thank you...?   
  
**Draco:**   
Gilgamesh! Tiamat! You...!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Now, Fujimaru, come to Mother!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
There there, there's nothing to worry about anymore. Come let Mother hug it all away.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Tiamat...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I appreciate you trying to help me.  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
You're welcome...?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But&mdash;  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm going with Draco.  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
...!?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
B-But...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Even if we end up on opposing sides&mdash;  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I feel like I have to see this through.  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
...   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Setanta:**   
And that's how it is, Tiamat. This Master's a stubborn one too.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Just sit this one out, okay? I promise I'll take care of things from now on.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
... (Sniff)   
  
**Setanta:**   
Tiamat...?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
# Waaaaaaaah!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Wh...!?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Gyaagh!?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Waaaaaaaaaaaaah! My poor child's becoming a delinqueeeeeeeeent!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Ahahaha! Well, this turned out pretty bad!   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Ugh! Will you not calm yourself, fool?   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
This is why gods are more trouble than they're worth! She's just throwing a tantrum!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
[♂ He /♀️ She]'s been seduced by the wicked Beeeeeeeast! WAAAAAAHHHHH!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Hic... Hic... Boo-hoo-hoo...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I-Is she calmed down...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
Dammit...now what do we do?   
  
**Locusta:**   
This is all your fault, Master.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Seriously...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm not so sure about that...  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
Mother...is having...a bad time... My brain...is in pieces...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
My child is beset with nasty beasts...nasty bugs? Oh, I'll kill them all...!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Hmm, I wonder if there's any use in hoping this blows over sooner rather than later?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Don't act like you thought otherwise!   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
This work is outside the scope of my contract, damn you! Prepare to be charged an additional fee!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's just stop this here!  
  
**Locusta:**   
Wooaah, O divinity! Put your restlessness to an end!   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You too, Draco, please?  
  
**Draco:**   
I hear you. Lower your volume. It echoes in my head.   
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Why...? Why must this be happening?   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Where have I gone wrong?   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Tiamat:**   
Mother doesn't approve of you keeping that Beast company!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Waaaaaaaahh! Don't you forget that!   
  
**Setanta:**   
And off she goes...   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Ugh, after all the rampaging she did! Nothing good ever comes from associating with a goddess after all!   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
I've completely lost interest... You lot would do best to make yourselves scarce quickly too. You're dismissed.   
  
**Draco:**   
I've had enough of you...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry, but we can't leave yet.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We still haven't gotten our completion reward.  
  
  
---  
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Oh...the Demon Beast Incarnadine, you mean? Here you go.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just like that!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
It is but a trivial gift that never belonged in my treasury to begin with. I'd gladly give it away.   
  
**Draco:**   
You're the Floor Guardian, yet you would turn your back upon me, a Beast...!?   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
I have no interest in having dialogue with you, mongrel.   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
I only have one thing to say to you. &mdash;Take this seriously.   
  
**Draco:**   
...!   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Should you ascend this spiral, you will have to face what lies within you, whether you like it or not.   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
There is no humiliation quite like having that secret garden of flowers be trampled upon. Just you tremble and wait.   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Which is why you must ask yourself this. &mdash;Why are you going up?   
  
**Draco:**   
I...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeps...   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
But I suppose your companion of choice isn't so bad. I wouldn't exactly call it the greatest, but it's the best it could be.   
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
And that's it for the chit-chat. Here comes your ride.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Twilight Ladder...  
  
  
---  
  
**Gilgamesh:**   
Hurry along now. This is it for the Seventh Imitation Singularity.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Right. This is goodbye for now then. Take care now.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Aren't you coming with us, LA?  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
I'd like to follow up with Tiamat, you see. But don't worry, we might just run into each other again in due time.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
May the flowers bless the path upon which you walk!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Woah. I can feel a great power emanating from Emperor Nero!   
  
**Draco:**   
Hmm. This is&mdash;Luxuria.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Luxuria?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's the name of the Demon Beast Incarnadine?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
It's the one who seized you back in Chaldea.   
  
**Draco:**   
Each of the Demon Beast Incarnadines have been given false names based on the Demon God Pillars, but they each have their own True Names.   
  
**Draco:**   
Avaritia. Superbia. Acedia. Gula. Invidia. Ira. And Luxuria.   
  
**Setanta:**   
We're finally 1/7th of the way through... We've still got a long way to go.   
  
**Draco:**   
The Sixth Imitation Singularity is our next destination. In which case, the sealed Demon Beast Incarnadine would be&mdash;Ira.   
  
**Draco:**   
It's the Demon Beast Incarnadine that imitates the Gazing Death Star, Allocer.   
  
**Draco:**   
Take care now. The Seventh Singularity was... well, you witnessed it yourselves. But we're in for a harsh journey in the Sixth Singularity.   
  
**Draco:**   
The Sixth Imitation Singularity is a pilgrimage of death that leads to the Holy Land&mdash;the lost Holy City that is now but a grave.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Lost Jerusalem.   
  
## Section 6: Festival of Cravings Expedition: Lost Jerusalem  
  
**Narration:**   
That which was familiar and that which has become commonplace, lying side by side.   
  
**Narration:**   
The coldness of it makes one shudder. The chill of “death” making the blood run cold.   
  
**Narration:**   
Followed by&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**   
In this hazy scenery lies several earth-colored mounds. They number a mountain of corpses.   
  
**Narration:**   
The mounds stacked repeatedly with untimely ends, deaths gone unattended, deaths, and even more deaths.   
  
**Narration:**   
Mine is one of them. To have come so far and be put to death with no kind of resistance.   
  
**Narration:**   
I fear the sizzling pain. I fear the feeling of being lost.   
  
**Narration:**   
I fear becoming just another of those corpses. I fear dying a meaningless death.   
  
**Narration:**   
At the bottom of a desolate limbo&mdash; and in nobody's care.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A dream...  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
And again...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
my Command Spells are burning.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
...Are you awake?   
  
**Draco:**   
The Sixth Imitation Singularity is close. Make ready.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Bacon, eggs and mushrooms... Miso soup with seaweed and mushrooms...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Grilled mushrooms and mushrooms... And a full order of mushrooms, mushrooms, mushrooms, cabbage and mushrooms...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Good day and good appetites, jerkasseees! Get your food oooon!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Ain't nothing but mushrooms... Yeah, save your breath. I know the gag.   
  
**Draco:**   
Frolick in moderation. We are soon to arrive at the Sixth Imitation Singularity.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Sixth Singularity&mdash;  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Ruled by the Lion King, in my version.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
In the Sixth Imitation Singularity, the Knights of the Round Table had no means to interfere.   
  
**Draco:**   
Instead, the Holy City is ruled by the last grand master of the Knights Templar&mdash;Jacques de Molay.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jacques de Molay is, um...?  
  
**Draco:**   
Yes, a man worth pitying. His disgrace unjustified and faith unrequited.   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think Black Magic figured in somewhere...  
  
**Draco:**   
Ah, you know him well. A pitiful man falsely charged with heresies and burnt at the stake for them.   
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
The Knights Templar were a military order charged with the mission of protecting pilgrims to the Holy Land.   
  
**Draco:**   
Their influence spread throughout Europe while possessing wealth on par with a country. They must thusly have been subject to great envy.   
  
**Draco:**   
For what purpose was he defeated as a knight, besmirched as a priest, and deposed as a grand master?   
  
**Draco:**   
The hell that such a man produced in the Sixth Singularity had, I shall say, an adequate taste.   
  
**Draco:**   
I would not call the design by which he painted the blood-splattered pilgrim's road with reverent prayer inferior to the Lion King's Holy Selection.   
  
**Draco:**   
Have you anything to say? Are you reminded once again that I am a wicked Beast&ndash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait, Molay was a man?  
  
**Draco:**   
What are you talking about...? Ah, wait. I see what it is you mean.   
  
**Draco:**   
The emperor Nero was told of to later generations as a man. It's said that famed King of Knights lied about her own gender during her life.   
  
**Draco:**   
I am sure many such Servants must be recorded in Chaldea.   
  
**Draco:**   
So it is understandable how that would catch your attention. But make no mistake, Jacques de Molay is a man.   
  
**Draco:**   
And he is most likely the Floor Guardian for the Sixth Imitation Singularity.   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Molay is the Floor Guardian?  
  
**Draco:**   
That should be the safe assumption. And this time, he's likely to be swinging a holy sword to fell the beast.   
  
**Draco:**   
Whilst offering pure prayers bordering the pathetic. All in order to find atonement for having raised a false Holy Grail.   
  
**Draco:**   
And from hereon, you and I shall be trampling on such dignified faith. Ahahahaha!   
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Ladies and gentlemen, our craft has now arrived at the Sixth Imitation Singularity. Please take care not to forget your belongings upon departure!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Thank you for flying today with Twilight Ladder Airlines!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Stay behind me as much as you can, Master.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Leaving aside the matter of the Seventh Singularity... Truth is, the other Chaldea had a harsh go of it.   
  
**Setanta:**   
If this is the same Sixth Singularity as theirs&mdash;it'll be a scene of carnage.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Not to mention, the enemies will be on all sides. Music to my ears... However much warrior's luck I have to spend.   
  
**Draco:**   
The Testament World slipped through my fingers, turning the Singularity into a field for hunting beasts.   
  
**Draco:**   
What we need to do is plain. Find and defeat the Floor Guardian in order to free the Demon Beast Incarnadine.   
  
**Draco:**   
Now come with me, Master. The time to return to hell is finally here.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This is some sandstorm...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We can't see a thing.  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
Stay by me, master. It'll be bothersome if I lose sight of you.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Blech! It's getting in my mouth! So damn gritty!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeps! The wind looks to be stopping!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Tsk... About time the surroundings came into view...   
  
**Setanta:**   
But what the hell is this...?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Graves, huh...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A multitude of graves lining the main road.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But this is...  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Wha&ndash; Wha-wha-wha...!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Uhh... Same punchline as the Seventh Singularity?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I get it...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Halloween comes next...  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
# And what is Halloween!?   
  
**Draco:**   
Elisabeth, you say? That mere antihero? Explain the connection, because I can't see it.   
  
**Draco:**   
A pyramid...flipped over? And how did the Japanese castle come into play? Wait, be still. You must be babbling.   
  
**Draco:**   
After all, I know nothing of this. So rare and so strange an event never occurred in the other Chaldea.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It must be peaceful...  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
What kind of crap's going on in your Chaldea...?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Okay, but...what's the Master's crazy festival doing being held again in the Sixth Singularity to our critical acclaim?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I suppose it's Jacques de Molay's doing.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
As we saw in the seventh, the Floor Guardian has the power to distort their Singularity. It makes sense.   
  
**Draco:**   
But there's another reason to assert that, is there not?   
  
**Setanta:**   
That's enough chit-chat. The enemy's here.   
  
**Draco:**   
Not exactly...Knights of the Pilgrimage Road, however hard I squint.   
  
**Setanta:**   
So they're pumpkins, huh...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Contrary to their looks, they're honest about being hostile. Let's get 'em, Master.   
  
**Locusta:**   
I'm gonna twist their heads off and plant mushrooms down the stumps!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Setanta:**   
Either way, looks like we've got no choice but to follow this road to this so-called Lost Jerusalem...   
  
**Setanta:**   
But the Seventh Singularity, and then THIS? What's your problem? Are you messing around? Don't you know what being the last boss means?   
  
**Draco:**   
# It's not my fault!   
  
**Setanta:**   
You're breaking character...   
  
**Setanta:**   
You weren't like this when we fought back at that other Chaldea.   
  
**Setanta:**   
(It's really throwing me off my game...)   
  
**Draco:**   
Now, this is strange indeed... What is happening in this Testament World?   
  
**Draco:**   
Fujimaru, you say this is the handiwork of Jacques de Molay, no?   
  
**Draco:**   
Why do you think so? What do you know?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Molay here is probably&mdash;  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Not the Molay you're familiar with, Draco.  
  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
Hehehehe. This was inevitable. It was inevitable, right?   
  
**???:**  
Since I've been summoned in this Saint Graph, I had no choice but to become an Innocent Monster, right?   
  
**Molay:**   
Witches ought to be like witches. Demons ought to be like demons. I need to spread this curse all over the world.   
  
**Molay:**   
For the Human Order's sake? The Beast? To hell with them.   
  
**Molay:**   
But was I really summoned for the Human Order's sake...? Doesn't sound right to me.   
  
**Molay:**   
Bon, d'accord! This time around, there's something more to my liking than the Holy Grail!   
  
**Molay:**   
Demon Beast Incarnadine&mdash;The Beast of the Apocalypse. Now that befits a demon, no?   
  
**Draco:**   
So she's an Innocent Monster&mdash;a Jacques de Molay that manifested as a demon-worshipping witch?   
  
**Setanta:**   
They're messing around like it's Halloween and all... Isn't that in bad taste?   
  
**Draco:**   
Foreigners, their very existence is like a bad joke.   
  
**Draco:**   
We shouldn't take them seriously. But foolish as it may be, this is poor form indeed.   
  
**Draco:**   
Why was such a being summoned? My comprehension lessens by the minute...   
  
**Setanta:**   
She's deep in thought again, huh...   
  
**Locusta:**   
...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Let's be off, Master. We've got a long journey ahead of us. Be careful not to exhaust yourself.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Lord Master, I've got something that'll help with fatigue! A mushroom makes the exhaustion go poof!   
  
**Setanta:**   
I'm starting to wonder if they're mushrooms at all...   
  
**Locusta:**   
It's Vitamin B1! What sort of dangerous things are you imagining, you lecherous bonehead!   
  
**Setanta:**   
It's too late to act like you're any sensible! Oh, never mind that, let's just go!   
  
## Section 7: Destroying the Holy Land We've Conquered (1/2)  
  
**Setanta:**   
We've covered quite a bit of ground... Are you alright, Master?   
  
**Setanta:**   
It must've been pretty rough for you, considering we were fighting our way through all that...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Haa...haa...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm starting to miss the Sphinx...  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
That's a buggy Da Vinci made, no? So you've got her in your Chaldea too, huh?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yep...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She's a reliable friend of mine.  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
Sounds great, having a friend you can entrust your back to, that is. That's the most valuable thing of them all.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Just a little bit more. Looks like we've finally made it.   
  
**Locusta:**   
So that's the Holy City. Not too shabby.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Hold on. Someone's there.   
  
**Georgios:**   
&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Georgios!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If he's here, then that means...  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
How perceptive of you. You're exactly right, he'll be taking on the role of the knight Gawain you encountered in the Sixth Singularity.   
  
**Draco:**   
As far as being unassailable goes, he's just as good of a knight.   
  
**Setanta:**   
In other words, he's a formidable foe.   
  
**Draco:**   
Plus he's a dragon-slaying saint. So he's especially good against the Beast of the Apocalypse&mdash; the red dragon that is I.   
  
**Draco:**   
Leaving Jacques de Molay aside, he's certainly a Heroic Spirit summoned to vanquish me.   
  
**Georgios:**   
Hmm. Sodom's Beast and her contractor.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Pumpkin knights coming out the gate, one by one!  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
So reinforcements are here. And they're raring to go...!   
  
**Georgios:**   
!   
  
**Setanta:**   
...Huh?   
  
**Locusta:**   
That knight just got rid of those pumpkins?   
  
**Georgios:**   
I must apologize. I have my hands full right now.   
  
**Georgios:**   
If you have business with me, would you kindly shelve it for later?   
  
**Draco:**   
......   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He seems busy...  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
So, Master...what'll it be?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Help him out for now...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
If that's what you want to do, I don't mind...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Woohoo! Those damn pumpkins are going to choke with poisonous mushrooms stuck down their throats!   
  
**Setanta:**   
You don't even need poison for that!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Georgios:**   
&mdash;Thank you for your help. You did me a favor there, Contractor of the Beast.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The name's Fujimaru.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What happened here?  
  
  
---  
  
**Georgios:**   
I am Georgios; a Rider. A Servant summoned to this Sixth Imitation Singularity.   
  
**Draco:**   
You must be the Heroic Spirit summoned to vanquish me. So what are you doing?   
  
**Georgios:**   
Yes, it is as you say, O larval Sodom's Beast.   
  
**Georgios:**   
I was summoned alongside the Floor Guardian, Jacques de Molay, to intercept the Beast.   
  
**Georgios:**   
However, Jacques de Molay has been altered. No longer a pious friar but rather a demon-worshipping witch.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I knew it...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's the Foreigner version of Molay.  
  
  
---  
  
**Georgios:**   
Jacques de Molay is planning on summoning the Holy Mother of the Abyss, a fictitious and malevolent deity that she worships.   
  
**Georgios:**   
In all likelihood, she intends to use the Demon Beast Incarnadine as its vessel.   
  
**Draco:**   
What did you say!? She intends to use my Incarnadine for something as wretched as that...!?   
  
**Locusta:**   
We really shouldn't be playing along with this, but the situation seems pretty bad...   
  
**Setanta:**   
There's no telling what malice will be unleashed if that thing manifests, even if it's within a Singularity.   
  
**Georgios:**   
And thus I have a proposal for you...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, likewise.  
  
**Georgios:**   
Yes, I see... So we're both thinking the same thing.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Huh, huh, huh? Who's thinking what?   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What is it?  
  
**Georgios:**   
Well, it's not something I should be saying, but...   
  
  
---  
  
**F：Georgios:**   
Why don't we join forces?   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;You must be joking, dragon slayer.   
  
**Georgios:**   
Jokes are not my forte. I am well and truly serious.   
  
**Georgios:**   
This choice benefits both sides. I cannot allow Jacques de Molay to go on a rampage.   
  
**Georgios:**   
And you people seek to stop the Demon Beast Incarnadine from being misused.   
  
**Georgios:**   
Our goals align. In which case, we should be able to join forces.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I look forward to doing so.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Don't decide that on your own...!   
  
**Setanta:**   
No, it's only natural. Since we aren't being attacked, there's no reason why Master should antagonize him.   
  
**Setanta:**   
My Master's enemy is you and you alone. Don't get the wrong idea, Sodom's Beast.   
  
**Draco:**   
Tch...   
  
**Setanta:**   
O Knight Georgios, we shall entrust our backs to one another until we defeat Jacques de Molay.   
  
**Georgios:**   
Thank you, young warrior of the Ulster. I am honored to fight alongside you.   
  
**Georgios:**   
Let us be off then. Jacques de Molay has stationed many enemies within the Holy City.   
  
**Georgios:**   
I shall be your guide. Let us proceed along the path of least resistance.   
  
## 	Section 7: Destroying the Holy Land We've Conquered (2/2)  
  
**Georgios:**   
We've reached the throne. However...   
  
**Locusta:**   
The Unnamable is all over the place.   
  
**K：Molay:**   
Ooh la la. You shouldn't be sneaking around, guys. You're neither ghouls nor rats.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jacques de Molay!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The Foreigner version!  
  
  
---  
  
**K：Molay:**   
The Foreigner version... Who told you anything about any other?   
  
**K：Molay:**   
You wouldn't think there's some Lawful Good Saber me out there, would you? Ahaha, that would be ridiculous.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Actually...   
  
**Georgios:**   
Sir Jacques, put a stop to this tomfoolery.   
  
**Molay:**   
Tomfoolery? Ahahahaha. C'est vrai! Tomfoolery is the right word for it. Can't argue against that.   
  
**Molay:**   
I got Innocent Monster'd by some pulp novelist's tirades. Whoever came up with this must have had a serious humiliation kink.   
  
**Molay:**   
Still... Since I was summoned as living tomfoolery, what else am I supposed to do?   
  
**Molay:**   
I don't need to destroy the world. As long as we have delusional occultists and cults of idiots who take their nonsense at face value, the world is set to destroy itself on its own&mdash;   
  
**Molay:**   
Have an extra dose of gore and grotesquerie! Here begins Long Halloween, the nightmare from which you'll never awaken!   
  
**Georgios:**   
As expected, dialogue was not the answer. Now everyone, we have a job to do!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Draco:**   
Such cheap drama has no place in my theater's programme. It tasted unbearable. I would sooner drink a cup of poison.   
  
**Draco:**   
How dare you treat anyone to such an unsightly dish? This is a capital offense.   
  
**Draco:**   
Not that it matters. I wouldn't have let you alive either way.   
  
**Molay:**   
Oh my goat! Your Majesty is giving me the heebie-jeebies. It's a shame that my meal didn't please your palates.   
  
**Molay:**   
Would you prefer a chèvre grilled with vegetables?   
  
**Molay:**   
I swear in the name of the mother, the child, and depravity,   
  
**Molay:**   
O Earth Mother of Darkness, bearer of fertility with a thousand young!   
  
**Georgios:**   
What an ominous aura! Could it be...   
  
**Molay:**   
Eloim, Essaim, Eloim, Essaim, frugativi et appellavi!   
  
**Georgios:**   
The devil Baphomet?   
  
**Molay:**   
Yeah, she's probably more Baphomet this time.   
  
**Molay:**   
This world may be tearing at its seams, but it's not ambiguous or absurd enough to the presence of a false god&mdash;   
  
**Molay:**   
And then there's the materials being used. That's should turn out a pretty textbook devil, don't you think?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeps, Princeps, doesn't this feel like...?   
  
**Draco:**   
Yes, it is inside.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Demon Beast Incarnadine Ira!   
  
**The Dark Young:**   
&mdash;!   
  
**Draco:**   
The nerve...   
  
**Locusta:**   
The damned goat is aiming only for Princeps!   
  
**Molay:**   
Makes sense she's attracted towards the main body, no?   
  
**Molay:**   
And her getting a better vessel would be très bien for me.   
  
**Molay:**   
If I can have the true Sodom's Beast with all remaining Incarnadines absorbed as her vessel&mdash;   
  
**Molay:**   
A sham Harlot is still a fallen goddess. Our mother Outer Goddess might genuinely grace us with her presence!   
  
**Draco:**   
Cease this debauchery. A madman's delirium does not a god make.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;What?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeps!?   
  
**Setanta:**   
What's with this sudden turn of events?!   
  
**Draco:**   
My body...cannot move...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Draco!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What did you do, Molay?  
  
  
---  
  
**Molay:**   
Huh? Who? What? Me? I didn't do anything, though...   
  
**Draco:**   
Luxuria...?   
  
**Draco:**   
Ghah...!?   
  
**I：The Dark Young:**   
...   
  
**Molay:**   
No idea what that was, but bonne chance! Dark Young, the larval Beast is ours!   
  
**The Dark Young:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Molay:**   
...Huh? Hello?   
  
**The Dark Young:**   
&mdash;!   
  
**Molay:**   
Kyaaaaaaaaaaaa!?   
  
**Setanta:**   
The goat blew up!?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Oooooh, splatter...   
  
**Georgios:**   
The devil is crumbling into mud! But its nefarious presence only grows!   
  
**Molay:**   
HHHHHEEEEELLLLLPPPPP!   
  
**Georgios:**   
Sir Jacques!   
  
**Setanta:**   
She got swallowed by the mud!   
  
**Georgios:**   
It seemed as if the mud had a mind of its own!?   
  
**Locusta:**   
GhAaaaaaaah?! IT'S COMING AFTER US TOO!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Hurry! We're getting away from here, Master!   
  
**Draco:**   
Ugh...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Draco will be left behind!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We've got to save her!  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
PRINCEEEEPS!   
  
**Setanta:**   
I wish we could just abandon her...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Argh! Ok, I get it! You don't have to look at me like that, Master!   
  
**Georgios:**   
That mud was made from the goat fiend.   
  
**Georgios:**   
I can't begin to imagine what calamity will ensue if the Beast is swallowed&mdash;   
  
**Setanta:**   
So I couldn't ignore it either way... Okay, let's get this over with quick. Hurry up, Master!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Draco, over here!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Grab my hand!  
  
  
---  
  
**O：Setanta:**   
Master! You were supposed to stay behind!   
  
**Draco:**   
Fool... You shouldn't risk yourself so...!   
  
**Georgios:**   
Stop right there!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I guess I screwed up...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where's Draco?  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
My consciousness...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A dream  
  
  
---  
  
**Narration:**   
Applaud it; this swell of splendor expansive enough to drive the stars from heaven.   
  
**Narration:**   
Indulge in it; in this honey and venom, this pinnacle of plenty expansive enough to fill the seas.   
  
**Narration:**   
Splendor, prosperity, progress, orgasm, arrogance, affluence, decay, glory, supremacy, ascend, ascend, ascend, ascend, ascend, ascend.   
  
**Narration:**   
Opulence, finery, luxury, lavishness, rapacity, extravagance, surfeit, putridity, satiation, consume, consume, consume, consume, consume, consume.   
  
**Narration:**   
Gluttony, lust, greed, sorrow, wrath, sloth, vanity, pride, envy, affirm it, approve it, allow it, permit it, exalt it, endorse it, extol it, celebrate it.   
  
**Narration:**   
All holiness, all wickedness, all purity, all salacity, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of everything, all of its entirety, all of it altogether, all.   
  
**Narration:**   
All, of this world's evil. All, of this world's good. All, of this world's desire. All, of this world's love.   
  
**Narration:**   
Grant it all, steal it all, devour it all, drink it all, offer it all, expend it all.   
  
**Narration:**   
All of it. All of it. All.   
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;Burn it all down.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's too hot...  
  
  
---  
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;It's cold.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I can't breathe...  
  
  
---  
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;I'm drowning.   
  
**Narration:**   
I am burned down by the red. I start sinking into the red.   
  
**Narration:**   
Painfully/futilely; my hands yearn for it/reach for it, for the cosmos above.   
  
**Narration:**   
Ahh&mdash;the filthy Crucible of Desire which covers all heaven.   
  
**Narration:**   
Nevertheless, at ends of my outstreched hands are&mdash;the all too clearly shining, and blinding starlight.   
  
**Narration:**   
It is so persistent, so pitiful... and yet, no&ndash; because of that, the gemlight, I...   
  
**???:**  
Fujimaru! Take my hand!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Tiamat!  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
It takes more than my annoyed child saying “Shut up, you hag!” to hurt a mother's love!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I never said that!  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
This mud puddle is nothing compared to I, the Chaos Tide!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
If you want Mother drowned, come back with enough mud to cover all of planet Earth!   
  
**Setanta:**   
(Cough) (Cough!) That was way too close for comfort!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Are you okay, Master!?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Tiamat saved us!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where's Draco?  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Master... Look!   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Setanta:**   
That's weird...   
  
**Setanta:**   
The mud is...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
PRINCEPS!?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Did the mud absorb her?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
That's the sixth Beast in its normal state, actually. It is the dragon continuing to sup the sewage from the golden cup.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Fujimaru. Listen to your mother.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Your mother is proud of how you don't find a Beast's hand unworthy of shaking.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I'm sure I too would be much worse off if you all weren't this earnest.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
But a Beast is still a Beast. An Evil of Humanity&ndash; Absolutely incompatible with humanity by the laws of the world.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
You should know it better than anyone.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
Chaldea can accept a former Beast, but only after it loses its Beast credentials and becomes a Servant like any other.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
As long as she tries to remain a Beast&mdash; humanity must crush her under its heel.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
You have to fight, Fujimaru. My strong, kind child.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
We'll beat her here and now. Before she recovers the Authority of Sodom's Beast.   
  
**Georgios:**   
...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I can't argue against that, Tiamat.  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
Master...   
  
**Locusta:**   
...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We should defeat Draco  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
but I think now is not the right time.  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
Fujimaru...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Otherwise, we'd be...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
averting our eyes to the evils of mankind.  
  
  
---  
  
**Georgios:**   
...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
U...ugh...!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
You bad child! You unfair child!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
S-Sorry?!  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
I'll help Sodom's Beast, but only this once!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
# Molay!   
  
**???:**  
&mdash;Understood, madame!   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;!?   
  
**Setanta:**   
The mud stopped moving!   
  
**???:**  
I used my Floor Guardian jurisdiction to seal the Demon Beast Incarnadine's power.   
  
**???:**  
I apologize for the inconvenience to all of you. Please give me the opportunity to clear my name.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Who might you be?!   
  
**Georgios:**   
Oh..! It's you!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wild guess, but Molay?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The male Jacques de Molay!  
  
  
---  
  
**Molay:**   
Yes. I am the knight Jacques de Molay. On a brief visit.   
  
**Molay:**   
The witch version of myself stole dominance over my body, leaving me only as a wandering mind until Madame Tiamat came to my rescue.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I dragged him along because I liked that fluffy sheep.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Is there anything you can't do?   
  
**Molay:**   
I'll be restraining the Incarnadine. You go after the Beast while I do!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Copy!  
  
  
---  
  
**Molay:**   
Now then&mdash;   
  
**Molay:**   
Ooh la la? What's happening to me?   
  
**N：Molay:**   
&mdash;Hey, witch. I'll be keeping you in line.   
  
**Molay:**   
Ghah, there's something inside me! What the heck?   
  
**N：Molay:**   
Look at the number you've done to my body. However, I shall no longer let you do as you please.   
  
**Molay:**   
No way! A male me? And chivalry-headed Saber, no less? Y-you're not me! I'll never accept it! Buzz off!   
  
**N：Molay:**   
Were our positions reversed, I'd also be driving you off! But I couldn't get the hang of this Foreigner Saint Graph on my own!   
  
**N：Molay:**   
So less whining and more fighting! I won't let myself go without reaping what I sowed!   
  
**Molay:**   
Wheeeeeeeeeeh!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Some funny stuff going on over there.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Go, rebellious children! Quickly, before your mother changes her mind!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you, Tiamat!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's stop Draco!  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Woah...(Hold her)  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She's out cold, but she seems fine otherwise.  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Oh, Princeps. Thank goodness...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Once again, Sodom's Beast has grown stronger...   
  
**Georgios:**   
In all likelihood...the Demon Beast Incarnadine we sealed, Allocer, now dwells within her.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Allocer...perhaps it's the Demon Beast Incarnadine Ira.   
  
**Setanta:**   
So...what'll you do now, knight Georgios?   
  
**Georgios:**   
Whatever do you mean by that...?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Your mission is to defeat Draco and my Master. If you insist on a battle now, I'll accept the challenge.   
  
**Georgios:**   
Oh...so that's what you meant.   
  
**Setanta:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Georgios:**   
Let's not do that... Sir Jacques is the one at fault in this case.   
  
**Molay:**   
Ugh... Pardonnez-moi...   
  
**Georgios:**   
Besides, I'm quite interested myself now. That is, of what conclusion you will reach on this journey, O Contractor of the Beast.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Georgios...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thank you.

**Georgios:**   
No need for that. But the other Heroic Spirits summoned to this Testament World aren't going to be like me.   
  
**Georgios:**   
It will be an uphill battle. Godspeed to you all.   
  
**Locusta:**   
The Ladder's here! Alright, let's hurry! Scoot, scurry!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go to the next level!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oh, and...  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Mother still doesn't approve of the company you keep.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I'll definitely make sure to take care of Sodom's Beast next time. But until then, I'll leave things to you, Setanta.   
  
**Setanta:**   
I know... Leave it to me.   
  
**K：Molay:**   
Are you really fine with this, Georgios?   
  
**Georgios:**   
My power is that of a dragon slayer's. The power to recognize an enemy as a dragon, and smite them.   
  
**Georgios:**   
Which is why I can tell the true nature of a dragon.   
  
**K：Molay:**   
The true nature of a dragon?   
  
**Georgios:**   
The Bewitching Queen Draco can no longer be called the Dragon of the Apocalypse.   
  
**K：Molay:**   
So...you're saying she can no longer return to her true form as a Beast?   
  
**Georgios:**   
Well, I wouldn't go that far...but there is something off about this Testament World.   
  
**Georgios:**   
&mdash;Lady Tiamat.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
...?   
  
**Georgios:**   
In order to ascertain the truth behind this Spiral Testament World, please watch over and help them on their journey.   
  
**Georgios:**   
That should lead to the salvation of the Beast's Contractor.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
You don't need to tell me that!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I'm everyone's mother. And a mother never abandons her children!   
  
**K：Molay:**   
And off she goes...   
  
**Georgios:**   
For some reason, the Sixth Imitation Singularity was warped. As for what this distortion means...   
  
**Georgios:**   
Beware, O Contractor of the Beast. For the Fifth Imitation Singularity is the North American continent. A land torn apart by warfare between Heroic Spirits.   
  
**Georgios:**   
There is no telling what changes have occurred in that Singularity.   
  
**Georgios:**   
Scores of Heroic Spirits and a distorted world. A battle where the many will assemble to hunt you down.   
  
**Georgios:**   
&mdash;For that land is the embodiment of E Pluribus Unum.   
  
## Section 8: North American Myth Massacre: E Pluribus Unum  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Silence. I needn't hear your screams.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Those damned Incarnadines never stay dead. There's no end to this battle.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
That is how disease is.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Ah, Nightingale.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
Pathogens will proliferate ceaselessly in an unsanitary environment.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
I see... No problem&mdash;   
  
**Scáthach:**   
If they will resurrect, I simply need to kill them again.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
Certainly. However, the best method to erradicate a disease is always to sever the root of impurity&mdash; to purge the whole environment.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
And by that you mean the main Beast VI. And the Master contracted to her.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
It seems this Beast VI and Master you mention have escaped the lower layers and reached our Fifth Imitation Singularity.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Good to hear.   
  
**D：Scáthach:**   
Time to kill, then.   
  
**Narration:**   
I think I've done what I could. Maybe this is a good place to end it.   
  
**Narration:**   
There was nothing I could do. My only option left is to wait for the inevitable end.   
  
**Narration:**   
Do I just close my eyes / Do I just curl up here?   
  
**Narration:**   
Maybe then, my sleep/end will come slowly/swiftly?   
  
**Narration:**   
Oh&ndash;but I can't allow myself that.   
  
**Narration:**   
I am appealing to myself. / My soul disavows it. / My heart demands me. / My life calls for it.   
  
**Narration:**   
Even if the day might come that my knees will bend / Even if there is nothing I can do to stop it.   
  
**Narration:**   
Even so, I have to stand / Even so, I cannot avert my eyes.   
  
**Narration:**   
I will grit my teeth against the burning pain/swallow the crushing feeling of powerlessness.   
  
**Narration:**   
I need to tell myself that my hands never stopped fighting&mdash; / I need to tell myself that my hands never let go&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;No matter how disgraced I become, I refuse to give in. No matter how far I might fall, I refuse to submit.   
  
**Narration:**   
Oh, how vile it is. Oh, how pathetic.   
  
**Narration:**   
And yet, that is mankind's true nature. That is the desire that births all evil.   
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;Wanting to live.   
  
**Narration:**   
Nay, it'd be insulting to call that a “desire”.   
  
**Narration:**   
It is a longing scream laying all to bare&ndash;an earnest prayer with the innocence of a newborn.   
  
**Narration:**   
Ergo, the all too banal beastliness of mankind.   
  
**Narration:**   
Yet in spite of that/because of that, it shines on for dear life amidst the filth&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Draco?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you awake?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
I...was swallowed by the mud... What happened after that?   
  
**Draco:**   
Where are we? The Ladder...?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you hurt?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You shouldn't force yourself.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
You needn't worry.   
  
**Draco:**   
If anything, I feel more powerful. I am in excellent tune.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Because you retrieved the Incarnadine?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's two out of seven.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Yes. First I retrieved Luxuria in the Seventh Singularity, and now the Incarnadine Ira has returned to me.   
  
**Draco:**   
The Fifth Imitation Singularity awaits us next. Horrid war grounds, as you know.   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Locusta:**   
Today's dish will be Porcini Tagliolini.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Woaaaaaaaaaaah! Some proper food at laaaaasst!?   
  
**Draco:**   
Stop fussing during a meal.   
  
**Draco:**   
We're about to reach the Fifth Imitation Singularity. Brace yourselves.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Ugh...but you know, we've seen how things have been so far, so it's probably going to be the same here too, no?   
  
**Draco:**   
Like I said, it's not my fault!   
  
**Draco:**   
I do admit I'm curious about the distortions that occurred in the Seventh and Sixth Imitation Singularities, though.   
  
**Draco:**   
The Testament World may be crumbling, but would that alter it to that extent?   
  
**Setanta:**   
I know, right...? We've been fooling around up until now, so it's easy to forget...but this isn't exactly a good situation we're in.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We can't let our guards down...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But our objective remains the same regardless.  
  
  
---  
  
**E：Draco:**   
Exactly. We shall retrieve the Demon Beast Incarnadine from the Floor Guardian.   
  
**E：Draco:**   
The Fifth Imitation Singularity, the North American continent.   
  
**E：Draco:**   
A war between the east and west, not for independence, but a Singularity perpetuated by the hands of Servants.   
  
**E：Draco:**   
The sealed Demon Beast Incarnadine is Invidia. It's the Incarnadine that posed as the Demon God Pillar Halphas.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Fifth Singularity I'm familiar with.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A war between the United States army and the Celts.  
  
  
---  
  
**E：Draco:**   
The Fifth Imitation Singularity is similar to the one you're familiar with. Except the mechanical army commanded by the Presi-king does not exist.   
  
**E：Draco:**   
The Allied Resistance is what opposes the Celtic forces.   
  
**E：Draco:**   
The Resistance is a small-scale army. The Celtic forces possess an overwhelming advantage.   
  
**E：Draco:**   
The situation that other Chaldea faced may have been even more dire than the one you did.   
  
**Setanta:**   
The Celtic forces, huh...?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Oh, can't find it in yourself to do this?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Nah, I'm good.   
  
**Locusta:**   
You damn Berserker.   
  
**Setanta:**   
I'm a Saber. Oh, but I see. The Floor Guardian this time is...   
  
**Draco:**   
It's probably the Mad King Cú Chulainn. The Berserker version of you.   
  
**Setanta:**   
To be more specific, it's the Alter version of me. But&mdash;it is interesting. Bring it on, I say.   
  
**Setanta:**   
I have no business being a hero if I can't even surpass myself.   
  
**Draco:**   
Of course, the Celtic forces aren't our only enemies.   
  
**Draco:**   
Since they've been summoned to vanquish Beast VI, the Resistance Army are also our enemies.   
  
**Setanta:**   
That is, unless things get all weird again.   
  
**Draco:**   
Don't even start.   
  
**Locusta:**   
We've arrived...   
  
**Draco:**   
The Fifth Imitation Singularity. The war-torn land where Heroic Spirits gather&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
What a desolate place this wilderness is...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Is that so? Not much different from the desert we were in just a while ago.   
  
**G：Setanta:**   
...Hm?   
  
**Setanta:**   
...!   
  
**Setanta:**   
# Run!!!   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Hold on, Fujimaru!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Woah!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Hold on tightly)  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Huh? What's going on?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Stop dilly-dallying!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Huh, is this sexual harassment? Are you ignoring compliance? You think you're going to pass an inspection like this?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Ack! I bit my tongue!!!   
  
**Draco:**   
Here it comes!   
  
**Draco:**   
Ungh...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
What's happening?   
  
**Setanta:**   
It's an attack! Those bastards ambushed us!   
  
**Karna:**   
I missed...   
  
**Arjuna:**   
We're just getting started. Commence all-out assault!   
  
**Celtic Warriors:**   
Ooooooohhhhhhhh!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Yikes! They're swarming us!   
  
**Draco:**   
Haha! This is more like it!   
  
**Setanta:**   
This is no time for laughs! Let's cut a path through them!   
  
**N：Karna:**   
It is inevitable that you have no choice but to die here.   
  
**O：Arjuna:**   
This is where your hell begins.   
  
**O：Arjuna:**   
O Sodom's Beast. O Contractor of the Beast! All evil shall be vanquished!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**N：Arjuna:**   
Expanding sacred domain. Domain secured. Divine punishment enforcement limits...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Not on my watch!   
  
**Arjuna:**   
Ngh...!   
  
**K：Karna:**   
Behind you.   
  
**I：Setanta:**   
Gwaaaah! Damn...!   
  
**Arjuna:**   
Youthful champion of Ulster, why do you side with the Beast?   
  
**I：Setanta:**   
I don't care about the Beast...but I can't let you kill my Master!   
  
**Arjuna:**   
Foolish. [♂ He /♀️ She] became an enemy of mankind the moment [♂ he /♀️ she] took the Beast under [♂ his /♀️ her] command.   
  
**Arjuna:**   
[♂ He /♀️ She] is not even the same Master you knew.   
  
**Setanta:**   
So what? That's not the point here!   
  
**Karna:**   
Ridiculous karma. Is it really worth risking your life?   
  
**Setanta:**   
What, chickening out already? A life is a cheap price to pay!   
  
**Karna:**   
I see how it is.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Kh...! This isn't gonna end well!   
  
**Arjuna:**   
Perish, then.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Oof, that's gonna be a killer!   
  
**Draco:**   
Fujimaru! Can you block it?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll try!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Come out!  
  
  
---  
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Setanta:**   
Do it now!   
  
**Draco:**   
Rot away!   
  
**Arjuna:**   
&mdash;How regrettable.   
  
**Karna:**   
Well played...   
  
**Setanta:**   
...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Ghaaah...! That was tough!   
  
**Locusta:**   
You were 100% giving it your maximum effort, after all...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Looks like this time, it's really gonna end in carnage...   
  
**Draco:**   
Indeed, this is where the real show begins.   
  
**Draco:**   
There's no time for rest. Let us advance before reinforcements arrive.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Ugh...this is such a pain...   
  
**Setanta:**   
I agree, but what do we do next? Where's the Demon Beast Incarnadine sealed?   
  
**Draco:**   
It's where the Floor Guardian&mdash; the Mad King Cú Chulainn resides.   
  
**Locusta:**   
In other words...?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Probably Washington.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The White House.  
  
  
---  
  
**Scáthach:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Nightingale:**   
I've received word from the scout unit that Karna and Arjuna have been defeated by Beast VI.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
I see.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
She may have lost her power, but our enemy remains a Beast. Do not underestimate her.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
Our enemy is the larval Sodom's Beast and her Contractor. And a woman who appears to be an Assassin.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
And&mdash;a Celtic warrior boy.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
...A boy? I see. So that's how it is.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
The fate of a Heroic Spirit is a very odd thing. Don't you agree, Cú Chulainn?   
  
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Scáthach:**   
As unfriendly as ever, I see. You didn't use to be that way.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
I will lead the alliance against Sodom's Beast. I entrust this place to you...   
  
**Scáthach:**   
No problem.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
In this Fifth Imitation Singularity... Nay, in this Spiral Testament World, neither the Resistance nor the Celtic army hold any meaning.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
All is for the sake of vanquishing Beast VI. We shall unite as one to do so.   
  
## Section 9: The Ailing Ones and the Connected Ones  
  
**Locusta:**   
We finally reached the city, but...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No one's here...  
  
**Draco:**   
Not quite...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Yeah, there's people hidden everywhere.   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I have a bad feeling about this.  
  
**Setanta:**   
Good eye, Master.   
  
**Draco:**   
Indeed, we are surrounded.   
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
How irksome...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Heh...!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Celtic warriors&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
And the Resistance.  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
They're teaming up against us?   
  
**???:**  
Yes. We are all united to slay the Beast.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nightingale...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I imagined you'd be here.  
  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale:**   
Have we met before? In that case...   
  
**Nightingale:**   
Please accept your treatment without resistance. I want to save all of you.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
I'll amputate the sections of you that are afflicted by the Beast.   
  
**Setanta:**   
I think I already know the answer, but how?   
  
**Nightingale:**   
The cause of the disease are the larval Sodom's Beast and the Beast's contractor. I'll completely sterilize them off the face of the Earth.   
  
**Locusta:**   
She's bonkers! She's gotta be high on some stuff!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Agreed, but you're no better.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
I will save you, even if I have to kill you in the process.   
  
**Draco:**   
Talking will get us nowhere. Come hither and I shall devour you.   
  
**Draco:**   
Your smell of pharmaceuticals is unbearable but certainly, if I think of it as medicinal cooking, I should be able to stomach it.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
Sodom's Beast. The Beast disease afflicting you is making you suffer.   
  
**Draco:**   
To be a Beast is not my illness. It is a chronic disease rotting away at mankind.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;There is no cure.   
  
**N：Nightingale:**   
No, no. You should know it better than I.   
  
**N：Nightingale:**   
What is the cause of the headaches tormenting you?   
  
**Draco:**   
...Gh!?   
  
**Draco:**   
Ugh... Ghh...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Draco...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're getting pale...  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Locusta:**   
# Hey.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
Yes? What is it?   
  
**Locusta:**   
A lowly attendant like you is undeserving of the Princeps' attention.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Hey, Shrooms? What's wrong with you?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Die. Drink poison and die. Die in agony drowning in poison.   
  
**Locusta:**   
I'll be sure to desecrate your dead body and make into a mushroom bed.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
Poison! Poison! Poison! Mold! Disease! No... no, no, no, no!   
  
**Nightingale:**   
I will abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous, and will not take or knowingly administer any harmful drug.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
With loyalty will I endeavor to aid the physician in his work, and devote myself to the welfare of those committed to my care.   
  
**Locusta:**   
SHUT UP! Get some poison in Apollo, Asclepius, Salus, and Panacea's throats!   
  
**Locusta:**   
DIE, die, diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeee!   
  
**Setanta:**   
What's got the dumbass so heated up?   
  
**Draco:**   
Ah... How bothersome. My head feels about to split in two.   
  
**Draco:**   
But Locusta needs us. Let us slaughter this riffraff!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Nightingale:**   
It's too late...for treatment... What a shame.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Real shame indeed~. Have a shameful, miserable, and painful death.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
I wasn't talking about myself.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
It's you...who need treatment...   
  
**Locusta:**   
You freaking madcap... You think you're sooo much better than us.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
I... was only trying to kill you...to save you from your illness...   
  
**Locusta:**   
You're more than a few mushrooms short of a batch.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
Yes, I agree. I'm trying to be righteous even if that makes me insane.   
  
**Nightingale:**   
But you... You are rightfully trying to be insane.   
  
**Locusta:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Nightingale:**   
The life you chose is...severely...painful to look at...   
  
**Setanta:**   
I'm pretty much done on my end too... Hey... Calmed down now, Shrooms?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Not the moment for jokes, doggo.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Look who's talking.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Locusta?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you alright...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Sorry for worrying you, Lord Master.   
  
**Locusta:**   
I'm afraid of needles, so these medical workers put me in a bad mental state!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Injections weren't invented yet in your era.   
  
**Locusta:**   
There's also the issues with phlebotomy...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Okay, now this is starting to sound believable.   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
**Draco:**   
Hurry ahead. The enemy has predicted our actions.   
  
**Draco:**   
We shall rush to Washington. A troop marches towards us. Let them hear our war cries.   
  
## Section 10: I Wish I Could Pierce Through That Chest Myself  
  
**Setanta:**   
We've entered Washington...   
  
**Locusta:**   
I didn't think it would be this easy.   
  
**Draco:**   
There's less resistance than I expected... A trap, perhaps?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Maybe. Or they have some unexpected problems on their end.   
  
**Setanta:**   
War never works out the way you think, y'know? Still, we should be careful.   
  
**Setanta:**   
We're probably gonna run into something worse than a million enemies.   
  
**Draco:**   
This...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The whole surface is covered in blood...  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Oooh... Genocide...   
  
**Setanta:**   
...So it's you?   
  
**Setanta:**   
&mdash;Scáthach.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Hm? Oh, you've arrived.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Yo, teach. Uh, I mean... Good day.   
  
**Setanta:**   
I'm Setanta. It's good to see you again... Is that what I say in this situation?   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Heh. What an odd thing to ask. You were already Cú Chulainn when you came to me.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Well, you're the one who kept calling me Setanta...   
  
**Setanta:**   
But the truth is that I really am Setanta... I haven't reached the point where I can call myself Cú Chulainn yet.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
How laudible. Well, I'd like to say I have a lesson for you after being away so long...   
  
**Scáthach:**   
But you've sided with the Beast. So, yes. I have to kill you.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Is she secretly a Berserker too!?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nope, that's just Scáthach...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How very Celtic of her...  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
Hey, it's not like we're best friends now or anything.   
  
**Setanta:**   
I just want to keep Master safe.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
They're one and the same, you fool.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Neither the Beast larva nor its contractor can be overlooked. They must be slaughtered.   
  
**Setanta:**   
...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Y'know, teach...[♂ he /♀️ she]'s shouldering something a lot worse than the destruction of the Human Order.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Maybe you get it more than I do...but isn't all of Pan-Human History on the line here?   
  
**Setanta:**   
If [♂ his /♀️ her] Chaldea screws this up, then it's all gone&mdash;   
  
**Setanta:**   
The others are one thing, but you wouldn't get that...   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Oh, that?   
  
**Scáthach:**   
&mdash;I just don't care.   
  
**Draco:**   
...Gh! You...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Whoa, whoa. What are you saying, teach...?   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Why are you even asking this?   
  
**Scáthach:**   
The downfall of Pan-Human History. The bleaching of the Earth. Of course those things matter.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(I knew it...)  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Of course she knew all about it.)  
  
  
---  
  
**Scáthach:**   
But Setanta. So what?   
  
**Setanta:**   
What...?   
  
**Scáthach:**   
It is a trial&mdash;one that the Beast's contractor and the others who live in that world must face.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Heroic Spirits&mdash;are as dreams of the deceased, but not a means to shoulder every burden.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
I was summoned to this Spiral Testament World as an instrument to slay Beast VI.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
The end of this story is not for me to know. That's what a Servant is.   
  
**Setanta:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Besides, Setanta.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
It's only the end of the world. This sort of thing isn't unusual.   
  
**Setanta:**   
I see... So that's how it is. You really are just a Servant, Scáthach.   
  
**Setanta:**   
It shouldn't even be possible for you to be a Servant in the first place.   
  
**Setanta:**   
You're definitely Scathach, yet you're not.   
  
**Setanta:**   
You're the same as the ones sprouting up down below... just another shadow.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
The same goes for you, my foolish apprentice.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
The fervor, the passion swelling within, the raging bloodlust; all that you harbor in this moment. Know that they are merely warped projections of bygone days.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Fail to do so, and you will set out upon a mistaken path. The ideals of the living shall be contaminated by the past brought about by the dead.   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
**Setanta:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Setanta:**   
...Haaaaaaah!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Setanta...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
I don't get any of this! She's an old hag, but I'm still just a kid!   
  
**Setanta:**   
“That's what a Servant is!?” “Who cares what happens next!?”   
  
**Setanta:**   
If that's the case, then why are Heroic Spirits even a thing!? We break the rules simply by existing!   
  
**Setanta:**   
I mean, why do they all gather under [♂ him /♀️ her]!?   
  
**Draco:**   
Setanta, you...   
  
**Setanta:**   
If I were nothing more than a Servant who couldn't go beyond the limitations of my vessel, then&mdash; I wouldn't be fit to call myself a hero!   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Exactly the sort of nonsense I'd expect from you...   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Still such an immature child. How can a brat like you rail against the way of things?   
  
**Scáthach:**   
You still need to learn the ways of the Celts, Setanta.   
  
**Locusta:**   
The ways...of the Celts...?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yep, that's Scáthach all right...  
  
**Locusta:**   
Scáthach of the Celts, huh...   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's kinda like the "ways of the Romans."  
  
**Draco & Locusta:**   
“Do not associate us with that.” “Don't lump us in with her.”   
  
  
---  
  
**Scáthach:**   
Still... Hm, I see.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
&mdash;How very like you, Setanta.   
  
**Draco:**   
Good grief. What a racket this is.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;It is exactly as you say, O Queen of the Land of Shadows.   
  
**Draco:**   
The end of the world has been brought up many times now. It's a rather mundane thing, albeit still delectable.   
  
**Setanta:**   
You know that's your fault, right...?   
  
**Draco:**   
Even so, I take umbrage with the idea of the dishes lining my dining table being made light of.   
  
**Draco:**   
In the first place, your opinion on the matter was not asked for. Keep your food reviews for an audience who wishes to hear them.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Cease your bravado, Sodom's Beast. You've long since lost your taste for these things.   
  
**Draco:**   
What are you saying...?   
  
**Scáthach:**   
That we are more alike than you think. We share the same desire, you and I...   
  
**Scáthach:**   
&mdash;A ■■■■■ ■■■■.   
  
**Draco:**   
...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What was that just now?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I couldn't really hear you that well...  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
...   
  
**Scáthach:**   
But if a dinner is what you seek, have a taste of my spear.   
  
**Draco:**   
What prattle...   
  
**Draco:**   
We face more than just your spear, do we not? Where is the Floor Guardian?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Yeah... He's here, isn't he? An Altered me, like a curruid from that crazy sea.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Ah... Well if that's how you'd rather have it. &mdash;He's been here the whole time.   
  
**Setanta:**   
&mdash;Guh!?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeps! Look!   
  
**Draco:**   
A Demon Beast Incarnadine!? When did it get here!?   
  
**Scáthach:**   
I suppose it is about time he came back.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The blood on the ground...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's gathering into the shape of a person!  
  
  
---  
  
**E：Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
Cú Chulainn... But why?   
  
**Draco:**   
Why do I sense a Demon Beast Incarnadine from you?   
  
**Scáthach:**   
&mdash;It broke the seal.   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
**Draco:**   
What...?   
  
**Scáthach:**   
We fought it with all our strength. But as long as Beast VI remains alive, the Demon Beast Incarnadine cannot die.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
The Mad King Cú Chulainn was swallowed up by the Incarnadine&mdash;   
  
**Scáthach:**   
But he used his power as a Floor Guardian to seal it inside himself.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
I have to keep killing him so it doesn't regain its power.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
But that all ends here. &mdash;Can you hear me, Mad King?   
  
**Scáthach:**   
We end this here and now.   
  
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&mdash;Yeah. I know, teach.   
  
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Either I slay her, or die by her hand&mdash; Either way, this comes to an end.   
  
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Let us slaughter each other. Leave not a speck of dust behind.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Well, he certainly smells like my Princeps...   
  
**Setanta:**   
He's another me&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
But at the same time, he's also the Demon Beast Invidia, huh?   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Come, Setanta. Your trial begins now.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Surpass your own shade with your inexperienced skills and your incomplete soul!   
  
**Setanta:**   
All right!   
  
**G：Setanta:**   
I'm not yet the Hound of Culann! So there's no way I'll lose to that spear!   
  
**G：Setanta:**   
My spirit may not be at its best yet, but I still tear my foes up with the best of 'em!   
  
**G：Setanta:**   
Now&mdash;I'll rip that heart right outta you!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&mdash;So this is as far as I go.   
  
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I'll be heading out first, Scáthach.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeps! What about the Demon Beast Incarnadine!?   
  
**Draco:**   
Yes, Invidia is back with me now.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;We have won.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
# Not yet!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...No!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Scáthach's using Gáe Bolg!  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
Nope! This...is the end!   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Setantaaaaa!   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm... I see, so this is...   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Being defeated by the Cú Chulainn version of you is one thing, but I never figured I'd be done in by you, Setanta.   
  
**Setanta:**   
I don't give a damn about Cú Chulainn. My future is my own.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Which is why&mdash;I'll kill the real you too someday.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Scáthach:**   
...Is that so?   
  
**Setanta:**   
...   
  
**Setanta:**   
It's over, Master.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well done...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thanks, Setanta.  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
You know, Master... It feels strange being a Servant.   
  
**Setanta:**   
I know that I'm Cú Chulainn.   
  
**Setanta:**   
I know how Cú Chulainn lived, and how he met his end.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Even this blade is one that the future me used.   
  
**Setanta:**   
&mdash;But you know, I still don't know anything. I still don't understand a thing.   
  
**Setanta:**   
After all, I haven't accomplished a single thing yet, haven't I?   
  
**Draco:**   
Do dreams of the dead speak of the future...?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Oh, I don't think of myself as a dead man at all.   
  
**Setanta:**   
In the first place, I wouldn't have gotten killed by that woman...Medb, was it?   
  
**Draco:**   
Hmm...   
  
**Locusta:**   
The Ladder has descended...   
  
**Draco:**   
Three Demon Beast Incarnadines. Luxuria, Ira, and Invidia have been reclaimed.   
  
**Draco:**   
The remaining four are&mdash;Gula, Acedia, Superbia, and Avaritia.   
  
**Locusta:**   
We're almost halfway through. Things are going well... I suppose? Though we keep getting stuck in life-threatening situations.   
  
**Draco:**   
Oh, but...   
  
**Draco:**   
(A Demon Beast Incarnadine had broken the seal? What is the meaning of this?)   
  
**Draco:**   
(It was the same in the Sixth Singularity too... What exactly is happening to the Incarnadines?)   
  
**Draco:**   
(A change that I'm unaware of&mdash;)   
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeps...?   
  
**Draco:**   
No...it's nothing. Get onto the Ladder. Let's head for the next level.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Next up is the Fourth Imitation Singularity.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A city in the midst of the Industrial Revolution.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;London.   
  
**Draco:**   
A city of death shrouded in demonic fog.   
  
## Section 11: The Death World in the City of ■■: London (1/2)  
  
**Narration:**   
Clean is dirty. Dirty is clean.   
  
**Narration:**   
Take a look at the world. This is where our prosperity has led us.   
  
**Narration:**   
Like a sweet, festering fruit. Like a flower blooming on a carcass.   
  
**Narration:**   
The world is&mdash;all too ugly. We know that well.   
  
**Narration:**   
And yet you still want to live? &mdash;There are no bounds to your sinfulness.   
  
**Narration:**   
Save her... Save my poor, tragically poor ■■■■■■■■...   
  
**Narration:**   
Save her... Help her... Take her hand...   
  
**Narration:**   
Someone, talk to her. Anyone. Ask her something.   
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;The thought of clinging on to life is absurd. &mdash;No matter how many times you throw it up, you'll never be satisfied.   
  
**Narration:**   
There is no hell here...   
  
**Narration:**   
This is purgatory. A dead end and naught more.   
  
**Narration:**   
“We” are the flame in her passion, the comets in her shower, the power in her empire.   
  
**Narration:**   
Bring here the poisoned cup. &mdash;Bring the golden grail.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Here's some yakasumba.   
  
**Setanta:**   
That ain't even food. It's some weird Asian medicine.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
London's coming up next.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What was the Imitation Singularity version like?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Up until the Fourth Singularity, the imitations were remarkably precise. Thus, you can imagine what's coming.   
  
**Draco:**   
Angrboda, the giant steam device in London's underground. Originally a gadget powered by the Holy Grail.   
  
**Draco:**   
In this Fourth Imitation Singularity, you should find the Incarnadine Gula installed as the power source.   
  
**Setanta:**   
And that's where the Floor Guardian will be?   
  
**Draco:**   
Yes. Most likely King Arthur's Alter variant. The King of Storms blessed by the Holy Spear and cursed by the Holy Grail.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Sure, but...that's assuming things won't go off-script again, right?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Nothing so far was the way you said it'd be. This next one is guaranteed to have a catch too.   
  
**Draco:**   
True... I cannot deny this Spiral Testament World is completely different from how I knew it.   
  
**Draco:**   
What awaits us is beyond my predictions. Be always vigilant.   
  
**Locusta:**   
We've arrived at the Fourth Imitation Singularity...!   
  
**Draco:**   
Let us set forth...   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;!?   
  
**Locusta:**   
My body...feels so...heavy... I can't...breathe...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Hey... I don't like where this is going...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, I don't feel so good...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is the Demonic Fog doing this?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Wait... Are you not immune to poison?   
  
**Draco:**   
You weren't affected by the Demonic Fog in the original Fourth Singularity...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeps... This isn't poison.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Well, it isn't not poison, either... There is poison mixed in, but it doesn't affect us...   
  
**Draco:**   
What are you saying? Not that I doubt your expertise...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Then what is it? Some curse or something of the sort...?   
  
**Locusta:**   
How should I know? Non-poisons are out of my field of expertise.   
  
**Locusta:**   
But if I were to gander a guess... It's something more, what's the word of it? Conceptual?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Someone's there.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A kid...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
No way there is. No person could survive in this.   
  
**D：???:**  
Help...   
  
**E：???:**  
Help... Help...   
  
**F：???:**  
Help...us...   
  
**???:**  
Helphelphelphelphelphelphelphelp helphelphelphelphelphelphelphelp&ndash;   
  
**Locusta:**   
Eek! Kazowie!   
  
**Draco:**   
Bleh...! What irksome timing...!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Quit the whining. No war is ever fought always in peak condition.   
  
**???:**  
Help...us...   
  
**???:**  
Save us...   
  
**???:**  
Take our hand...   
  
**Draco:**   
Ridiculous. Such wishes unbefit the word “desire”. It is like a flavorless drink.   
  
**Draco:**   
You waste your time... The likes of nameless stones by the roadside are beneath my attention.   
  
**Draco:**   
If salvation is what you want, seek a Saint or a Saviour.   
  
**???:**  
We don't wanna&mdash;   
  
**???:**  
We were at the river's mercy. It's dark and cold underwater.   
  
**???:**  
&ndash;Give us warmth&ndash;Give us light&ndash;   
  
**???:**  
Not love that consumes like a flame. Not passion that sears like heat.   
  
**???:**  
Softer. Tender. Please give us love like a soothing melody.   
  
**???:**  
Talk to us. Ask us something.   
  
**???:**  
Please, please, please&mdash;please love me.   
  
**???:**  
&mdash;Mummy.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;   
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Disappear, foul things.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Eeeeee... What were they? Those things that looked like the grudging curse of all sadists?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jack did that.  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
Jack the Ripper...? Are you sure?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Wow... She's certainly different outside of Chaldea.   
  
**Draco:**   
The real Jack will be after us. But... That would be...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Ugh... I'd super rather not be attacked in this moment in particular...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The fog probably can't enter buildings.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We should be safe indoors.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
That would be true for the original Fourth Singularity. We can only hope it is also the case here.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Let's make haste for Angrboda. We can figure out where's safe while we're at it.   
  
**Setanta:**   
How about here? Whew... Never a dull moment on this journey, huh!   
  
## Section 11: The Death World in the City of ■■: London (2/2)  
  
**Mordred:**   
Eat crimson lightning!   
  
**Mordred:**   
How you like that!?   
  
**Mordred:**   
Damn... Not enough to dust you?   
  
**Mordred:**   
Geez...what is it with this city? Is this pea soup really fog?   
  
**Mordred:**   
It's weighing down so heavy, my damn lungs feel like they're being crushed...!   
  
**Mordred:**   
Oh, hell... The Demon Beast Incarnadine is out...!   
  
**Mordred:**   
Ngh! Gaaaaah...!   
  
**Mordred:**   
Shit...!   
  
**Artoria:**   
All is swallowed by the fog. Nay... It better resembles a great cloud.   
  
**Artoria:**   
Now I see. The Fourth Imitation Singularity is positioned in the upper part of the Spiral Testament World.   
  
**Artoria:**   
Conceptually, this height is not far removed from the heavens.   
  
**Artoria:**   
Can the Demon Beast Incarnadine break the seal on Angrboda...?   
  
**Artoria:**   
It is gaining quickly in strength since coming here. Is it in proportion to Sodom's Beast&ndash;   
  
**Artoria:**   
But do not take me lightly, Incarnadine. If these be the heavens, then they are the domain of the King of Storms.   
  
**Artoria:**   
&mdash;Holy Lance, lift anchor.   
  
**Artoria:**   
Thrust and feast. Thirteen fangs&mdash;   
  
**Artoria:**   
&mdash;What?   
  
**Artoria:**   
Nkh...!   
  
**Artoria:**   
Why...? Why would you&mdash;   
  
**Artoria:**   
&mdash;Tsk!   
  
**Mordred:**   
Not this time, Incarnadine! I'll tear you apart, along with the Demonic Fog!   
  
**C：???:**  
How long... How long is it that you intend to play the knight?   
  
**Mordred:**   
...!?   
  
**C：???:**  
You are rightful son to King Arthur...the king's double, and duplicate of his living essence.   
  
**???:**  
Do you not agree...   
  
**Mother:**   
&mdash;Mordred, my child?   
  
**Mordred:**   
... Bringing out my mother, eh?   
  
**Mother:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Mordred:**   
Fine... I see what I'm up against. I know it's you, Jack the Ripper. You little bitch...!   
  
**Mordred:**   
Assassin scum! I'm the last one you want to play impressions with!   
  
**Mordred:**   
I'll turn you into a bloody smear! You've screwed with me for the last time, bitch!   
  
**Jack?:**  
&mdash;   
  
**Jack?:**  
&mdash;Yeah, that's true. Better to stop here.   
  
**Mordred:**   
...What!?   
  
**Mordred:**   
&mdash;Ugh! Above me!?   
  
**Mordred:**   
Forneus!? What's the Incarnadine sealed in the Third Singularity doing down here...!?   
  
**Mordred:**   
Damn it...!   
  
**Mordred:**   
Wha...   
  
**Artoria:**   
...   
  
**Mordred:**   
Father...?   
  
**Mordred:**   
Ah... Aah...?   
  
**Mordred:**   
Aaa&mdash; Aaaaaaaah...!   
  
**Mordred:**   
&mdash;This can't possibly be right! Father... King Arthur!   
  
**Mordred:**   
You've never spared the smallest thought for me! Not a trace of loving affection&mdash;or even contempt!   
  
**Mordred:**   
Isn't that what makes you you!? Then why!? How is it you're...!   
  
**Mordred:**   
This can't be... It can't be...any conduct befitting a king!!   
  
**Artoria:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Artoria:**   
I have no comprehension of your words, Sir Knight, as surely as I know not your name.   
  
**Artoria:**   
No longer am I Arthur. I utterly lack any capacity to hold sway over the people as king.   
  
**Artoria:**   
I am merely the raging storm. Ask not the storm for meaning, nor question its heart.   
  
**Artoria:**   
A storm merely pulverizes all in its sight. And now...   
  
**Artoria:**   
The demonic beast's head wriggles before me. That strange knight is out of my sights&ndash;   
  
**Artoria:**   
The Spear That Shines to the Ends of the Earth&mdash;Rhongomyniad!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Setanta:**   
This is bad... Everything's gone to hell.   
  
**Locusta:**   
There's nothing left here not reduced to ruins...   
  
**Setanta:**   
At a glance, a few buildings looked okay at face value... But sadly, the fog had penetrated.   
  
**Draco:**   
No place to take shelter from the fog, then?   
  
**Setanta:**   
So what's the plan? Should we stick strictly to finding our way underground?   
  
**Draco:**   
Fujimaru will not hold out down there.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But if we have no other options...  
  
**Draco:**   
I am not ruling out all other options, fool. Merely calling that one in particular unfeasible.   
  
**Draco:**   
Recklessness may be a heroic trait, but it comes off as slovenly once witnessed enough times.   
  
**Draco:**   
I have no love for such depravity.   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can tough it out if that's what it takes.  
  
**Setanta:**   
There's no toughing this out. Quit being a dumbass and face facts.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Where's this unfounded confidence coming from? Did you wake up a Celt this morning?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Even a demon boar would give a better account of crisis management. Get it together, idiot.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Lord Master... When the Celt, of all people, is telling you this...   
  
**Locusta:**   
And you'll find no argument from Locusta. However much fun a guy has with fungi, he must sober up eventually.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Use mushrooms responsibly by observing proper dosage and administration. Don't overdose. Ever.   
  
**Draco:**   
Both of you, leave it at that. You have [♂ him /♀️ her] on the verge of tears.   
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Ngh...!   
  
**Setanta:**   
There isn't much flexibility to scrutinize anyway...   
  
**Draco:**   
Some measure must be available...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Ugyaantioooooooch!?   
  
**Draco:**   
An extraordinarily powerful force... It's coming from&mdash;underground!   
  
**Setanta:**   
A force piercing the earth to strike at the heavens&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Rhongomyniad!  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Whaaaaa!? Who the hell's firing off a Noble Phantasm!?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Incarnadine came from underground...!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Uh, but, is that...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
If my eyes don't betray me, that's...Forneus?   
  
**Draco:**   
Ludicrous! How is this so!?   
  
**Draco:**   
What is the Demon Beast Incarnadine sealed in Okeanos, the Third Imitation Singularity, doing here?   
  
**Demonic Beast Forneus:**   
GAAAAAAAAAAAAA...!   
  
**Demonic Beast Forneus:**   
I&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
...!?   
  
**Demonic Beast Forneus:**   
I deny destruction. I reject the end's advent. I rebel against the setting sun.   
  
**Draco:**   
The Demon Beast Incarnadine... How can it&mdash;   
  
**D：???:**  
What are you looking for?   
  
**D：???:**  
&mdash;Over here.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Ah!?   
  
**Draco:**   
Nkh...! Jack the Ripper!   
  
**Jack:**   
...   
  
**Draco:**   
Poor prospects...   
  
**Draco:**   
Locusta! Are you nearby!? What of you, Setanta!?   
  
**Draco:**   
Fujimaru! If you are there, then answer!   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
**Draco:**   
Then I am isolated... The impudence of it, trapping me in the Demonic Fog.   
  
**???:**  
&mdash;Mummy.   
  
**Draco:**   
Away with you, gnats!   
  
**???:**  
Mummy...   
  
**???:**  
Mummy...   
  
**???:**  
...Mummy...               ...Mummy...   
  
**???:**  
MUUUUUUUUMMMMMYYYYYYYYYY!!!   
  
**Draco:**   
I'm telling you not to embrace me. There is no hope for your collective.   
  
**???:**  
You think so?    Maybe you're right.    We don't know, but&mdash;   
  
**Jack:**   
We don't wanna. We're still hungry!   
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Draco:**   
The fog...turned into...rain...?   
  
**Draco:**   
As I thought...changes beyond my awareness are occurring in the Imitation Singularities.   
  
**Draco:**   
Guh...! The pressure's...rising...!   
  
**Draco:**   
Locusta was right. This is not the poison of the Demonic Fog...!   
  
**Jack:**   
&mdash;This is London. The tinny city, London.   
  
**Jack:**   
The deluge of rain akin to tears. The surging tears are the flowing waters of the Thames.   
  
**Jack:**   
We were swept away. The bottom of that water was dark and cold.   
  
**Draco:**   
The remembrance of a fool...!   
  
**Draco:**   
Tch...!   
  
**Draco:**   
Guh...! Damn it... This is suffocating...!   
  
**???:**  
Offer some warmth... A light...   
  
**???:**  
Not that scorching love, not the passion that we yearn for.   
  
**???:**  
Tenderly and meagerly. Please offer love that resounds in the silence.   
  
**Draco:**   
Enough...!   
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;But I simply could not understand.   
  
**Draco:**   
My head...feels like it's going to split open...!   
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;I simply could not grasp the love they spoke of.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;   
  
## Section 12: The Death World in the City of ■■: London (1/2)  
  
**Narration:**   
Her life began at the sunrise. Not as an heir to the Empire but as a distant relative.   
  
**Narration:**   
The child of a weak patron with no prospect or ambition for the throne.   
  
**Narration:**   
But one first step set her life down the wrong path:   
  
**Narration:**   
“&mdash;I love you, Nero.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“I've decided to make you Emperor.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“And for that,”   
  
**Narration:**   
“I can and will do anything.”   
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;Agrippina. Her mother's corruptiveness.   
  
**Narration:**   
Nero's mother married Claudius, the previous emperor, and enacted all sorts of evil plots to make her child Emperor.   
  
**Narration:**   
She married Nero to Octavia, daughter of the previous emperor.   
  
**Narration:**   
This put Nero higher in line for the imperial laurel than her stepbrother Britannicus.   
  
**Narration:**   
And much more significantly&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**   
The Emperor was assassinated.   
  
**Narration:**   
The 4th Emperor Claudius was taken out by an unknown assailant and Nero took the throne as the 5th Emperor.   
  
**Narration:**   
Nero was pushed to the top of the Roman Empire at the young age of 17, by no movement herself willed.   
  
**Narration:**   
Perhaps due to the criticisms of her illegitimate ancestry, Nero loved outsiders more than she loved her family.   
  
**Narration:**   
She loved the nameless citizens more than she loved the famed nobles.   
  
**Narration:**   
She directly opposed the Senate's attempts to gain privilege, and the cesspool of self-interest that the whole political class had become.   
  
**Narration:**   
But she walked a thorny path in her reforms.   
  
**Narration:**   
“This person has done us a great service. &mdash;Pardon him, Nero.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“We hate this person. &mdash;Kill him, Nero.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Nero. My cute Nero. My flesh and blood, Nero. You are the Emperor. You stand atop of Rome. Atop the world.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“You shan't allow anything that doesn't go the way you want it to be.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Everything exists for you, Nero.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“I love you, Nero.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“You are my loved, my dearest.”   
  
**Narration:**   
Her mother's self-interested political interventions. Her conflict with the Senate. Reconciliation ever distant.   
  
**Narration:**   
What Nero's mother Agrippina did to her own daughter&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**   
“I don't understand... I truly don't know what you mean.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“I am not treating you as a person? Why would you say that now?”   
  
**Narration:**   
“That is how things always should, and have been, remember?”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Nero. My cute Nero. My flesh and blood, Nero. My loved, loved, loved Emperor&mdash;”   
  
**Narration:**   
“&mdash;My personal doll.”   
  
**Narration:**   
She never saw her daughter as anything more than a plot device to make herself the Emperor's mother.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
My Command Spells...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Whose dream...was that...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
Master! So that's where you were?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Good! Nice to see you're alright! Stay close to me!   
  
**Setanta:**   
That's some seriously nasty rain. My body has been...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Gh...my body is...heavy! This doesn't even compare to the fog...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Setanta, are you okay?  
  
**Setanta:**   
Worry about yourself first!   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This is definitely not good...  
  
**Setanta:**   
Any... Any solutions?   
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Hey, Shrooms... What's wrong with you? You're awfully pale.   
  
**Locusta:**   
...Princeps... Princeps... My apologies...   
  
**Setanta:**   
No response... She's not with us, mentally...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
And no sign of Draco...  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
Shit... We can't even search for the underground entrance like this.   
  
**???:**  
&mdash;Sorry, Mummy.   
  
**???:**  
&mdash;But we want back in.   
  
**???:**  
Return me home, return me home, return me home&mdash;   
  
**Setanta:**   
A threat coming at our lowest, huh...? That's the stuff that gets me fired up.   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Narration:**   
“Gg...grg...grgl... Nkh...”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Ne...ro...”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Mother. You may have your cup back.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“&ndash;This woman offered poison to the Emperor. Mother or not, treason is a capital crime.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“&mdash;Aah!”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Nero. Adorable Nero. My own Nero. What an egotistic emperor you are.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“You truly can't stop offering your love to those poor, unsightly people.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Oh&mdash;how tragic. My poor, sad Nero.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“You have nowhere to go. Because your home is where your mother is.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Your love won't reach them.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Because you are flame. All you know to do is burn. All in the world, its flowers and songs, feed the fire of your love.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“You call that love? No one can be this devoted. Not even the gods.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“You will never reach the stars.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Because you are a blood-colored rose, born with the sunrise and bound to shed your last petal with the setting sun.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“You are alone. And you will always be. You'll drown amidst your shivering loneliness and die.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“In the cold, barren edges of the land&mdash; with no one to attend your deathbed.”   
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Tiamat:**   
Can humans truly...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
...kill unborn children?   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Sodom's Beast...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I can defeat you now. I can put an end to this.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
But...   
  
**Draco:**   
Who...? Tiamat? Why? Why would you save me...?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
It wasn't for you. It's always for my child.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Still, you look awful, Sodom's Beast.   
  
**Draco:**   
It is just...a migraine... This rain...is worth more attention.   
  
**Draco:**   
Why is Forneus&mdash;Demon Beast Incarnadine Acedia here?   
  
**Draco:**   
The Third Imitation Singularity's Floor Guardian was presumably defeated.   
  
**Draco:**   
Acedia broke free and joined with Demon Beast Incarnadine Gula in the Fourth Singularity.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
And... What does that imply?   
  
**Draco:**   
The Third Imitation Singularity has already collapsed. This rain is&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;the Okeanos above us leaking from on high.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Come again...?   
  
**Draco:**   
No wonder it feels so heavy and suffocating in here. London is now conceptually the bottom of the ocean.   
  
**Draco:**   
Heh... The calamity comes out from the sea... How laughable.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;The cosmic ceiling of the Fourth Singularity will rupture.   
  
## Section 12: The Death World in the City of Grieving Rain: London (1/2)  
  
**Setanta:**   
Hey, hey, hey, hey!   
  
**Setanta:**   
What am I supposed to do about a deluge!?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Ohhh... Princeps...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Command Spells!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe they can...!  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
The Ladder's descending to us!? We haven't even cleared this floor yet!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Somebody's been going...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
out of their way to watch out for us.  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Master! I'm not a moment too soon!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
LA!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are you doing on the Ladder?  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
I made it to the Third Imitation Singularity ahead of you all, you see...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
It's all gone to pot up there. The Demon Beast Incarnadine got free and the Singularity collapsed.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Right about then, the Ladder started moving down on descent. I gave it a think and sure enough, hopped aboard!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Wah-wah-wah! Okay, the story can wait! Get on the Ladder, now!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Let's move, Master! You too, Shrooms.   
  
**Demonic Beast Forneus:**   
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Oh, come on! Why now!?   
  
**Demonic Beast Forneus:**   
I reject my demise. I refuse the curtain call. I rebel against the setting sun.   
  
**Demonic Beast Forneus:**   
We are the Beast's seven crowns. We are the dragon's seven heads. I, Demon Beast Incarnadine Acedia, shall in deluge of sloth subdue all!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Look out, Master!   
  
**Demonic Beast Forneus:**   
You shall not leave...   
  
**Setanta:**   
What's with this thing?   
  
**Demonic Beast Forneus:**   
You shall not leave, Fujimaru. You belong to me!   
  
**Setanta:**   
What the hell's this thing got in mind for Master!?   
  
**Draco:**   
Hurry!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
You don't have to tell me!   
  
**Jack:**   
You can't leave!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
You're a bad girl, Jack! Baah!   
  
**Jack:**   
Hey, don't leave us alone.   
  
**Jack:**   
Give us warmth.   
  
**Jack:**   
It's so cold here.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Ohh... It's so difficult watching your child cry.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Jack:**   
&mdash;Because we don't wanna die.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Ohhh...but...but...   
  
**Jack:**   
We&mdash;I...   
  
**Jack:**   
I reject my demise. I refuse the curtain call. I rebel against the setting sun.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
...! Do I smell Beast VI on that girl!?   
  
**Draco:**   
I thought as much...   
  
**Draco:**   
It may be that Jack the Ripper was invaded by the Incarnadine by way of the Demonic Fog spewing from Angrboda.   
  
**Jack:**   
We're hungry. We are hungry.   
  
**Jack:**   
We are&mdash;we are the Beast's seven crowns. We are the dragon's seven heads.   
  
**Draco:**   
She has already become an Incarnadine itself. In other words, having mimicked Barbatos&ndash;   
  
**Jack:**   
&mdash;I, Demon Beast Incarnadine Gula, shall in unending gluttony devour all!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
The child is becoming a Demon Beast Incarnadine...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
What could you possibly be thinking, Sodom's Beast...?   
  
**Draco:**   
About what?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Don't play innocent. The Demon Beast Incarnadines are your terminals. Their every movement is according to your will.   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Why is the Incarnadine attacking you?   
  
**Draco:**   
Things are different...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
What...?   
  
**Draco:**   
I had thought the same at first. That I, on the verge of dying, had unconsciously moved the Incarnadine.   
  
**Draco:**   
My unsightly refusal to die was enough to sicken me, but I considered the act as personally Nero as anything.   
  
**Draco:**   
However...things are different now.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
In what way, then...?   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;The Demon Beast Incarnadines are awakening to their own egos.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Come again...?   
  
**Draco:**   
Beast II.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Yes?   
  
**Draco:**   
Take care of things here. If you are able, go ahead and crush that thing.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
... ...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I came to help her, and she's bossing me aroooound!?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I knew Sodom's Beast was a wicked Beeeeaaaast!!   
  
**Draco:**   
You'll be overcome before long...! Your power is needed...!   
  
**Draco:**   
Call on me...Fujimaru! Call my name!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Setanta:**   
Shit! Give us a break!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Hey, Shrooms! Wake up and help me already!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Ugggggh, Princeps...   
  
**Setanta:**   
You're so useless!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Whaaaaaah! This is not looking good! Quick, hop on the Ladder!   
  
**Setanta:**   
I'm trying!   
  
**Setanta:**   
I just need the space for one more step&mdash;   
  
**F：???:**  
Okay, I'll give all the space you need and more.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Wha...!?   
  
**Demonic Beast Forneus:**   
&mdash;!?   
  
**K：Mordred:**   
You ain't getting away with your plans on my watch, Incarnadine!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mordred!?  
  
**Mordred:**   
Who's that? The Beast's Master?   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're helping us?  
  
**Mordred:**   
Hah? Are you crazy? You're the enemy.   
  
  
---  
  
**Mordred:**   
Eh, not that I care anymore. All that matters now is this Incarnadine!   
  
**Mordred:**   
You won't escape me! You stood before Mordred!   
  
**Mordred:**   
So I'll lay waste to everything you hold dear! Take my wicked sword&mdash;   
  
**Mordred:**   
Rebellion Against My Beautiful Father&mdash; Clarent Blood Arthur!   
  
**Demonic Beast Forneus:**   
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!?   
  
**Setanta:**   
&mdash;Master, now!   
  
**Mordred:**   
Tch... Was that it? Whatever you lot do next is none of my business&mdash;   
  
**Setanta:**   
We made it!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ouch...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I hit my nose on the jump...  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
M-Me too... But at least the shock brought me back to my senses.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Everybody on board? All right! Taking off!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Hold on right there! The Princeps is still down there!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's fine, probably!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Barring any surprises, she can handle herself!  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
...!? It's not over yet!   
  
**Demonic Beast Forneus:**   
GA...AAA...AAAAA...!   
  
**Demonic Beast Forneus:**   
YoU woN't... esCapE Me...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
GIVE UP ALREADYYYYYYYY!?   
  
**Demonic Beast Forneus:**   
My end... can't be here...! My end... can't be like this!   
  
**Demonic Beast Forneus:**   
Alone...with no one attending my deathbed&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I order you with my Command Spell!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Come to me, Draco!  
  
  
---  
  
**Demonic Beast Forneus:**   
&mdash;!?   
  
**Draco:**   
What a reckless act to rely on your Command Spells. This would have failed you with any ordinary Heroic Spirit.   
  
**Draco:**   
But you have my pardon! Well done calling upon my name, Fujimaru!   
  
**Locusta:**   
PRINCEEEEEEEEPS!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Amazing. Using a combo of a Chaldea Command Spell and the Independent Manifestation for ultra-fast movement isn't an idea I'd have expected to work!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Okay, now we finally got everyone here&mdash; blast off!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Alright, here we go!   
  
## Section 13: Ruptured Ends of the Distant Seas: Okeanos  
  
**Setanta:**   
Guh...! That was the worst ride ever!   
  
**Locusta:**   
My head's spinninnnnng!!!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Hold on tight, Master!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Got it!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I mean, woah-woah-woah!  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
Oh, come on! She just told you to hold on!   
  
**Draco:**   
Hold on, Fujimaru!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry, Setanta!  
  
**Setanta:**   
Hold on! Or else you'll get shaken off!   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Th-Thanks, Draco.  
  
**Draco:**   
Hmph, good for you. Not so bad, is it?   
  
**Draco:**   
Look at you, desperately clinging onto a child like me. How impressively unsightly. Heheh.   
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
We're about to leave the boundary of the Fourth Singularity!   
  
**Setanta:**   
So this is the Third Singularity?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
There is no longer any land remaining in this collapsed Third Imitation Singularity...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
The islands have been submerged, and the ever raging ocean is covering the world as far as the eye can see.   
  
**Draco:**   
Haha! It's akin to an apocalyptical scene, wouldn't you agree?   
  
**Locusta:**   
But we came all this way without retrieving the Demon Beast Incarnadine...   
  
**Locusta:**   
What will you do, Princeps? We could head back down if we really have to, but...   
  
**Draco:**   
Fret not, Locusta.   
  
**Draco:**   
For it is the Incarnadines who are relentlessly chasing us now.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;They approach. Steady yourselves.   
  
**Jack:**   
   
  
**Setanta:**   
It followed us from the Fourth Singularity...   
  
**Draco:**   
I asked her to handle it... Goodness. I should have known that Beast was not to be relied upon.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
That's slander! There was nothing I could do!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wow! What a surprise!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Tiamat! You came!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Tch...you're unscathed.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
The ocean is Mother's domain! A storm of this scale could not deter me!   
  
**Draco:**   
Very well then. Lend us your assistance. Confronting two Incarnadines at once will pose a great task.   
  
**Setanta:**   
I almost forgot we'd have both of them coming after us...   
  
**Setanta:**   
But why is that, Sodom's Beast? Why do the Demon Beast Incarnadines target you?   
  
**Draco:**   
That I do not know. At the very least, it appears the Incarnadines have awakened to their own egos.   
  
**Draco:**   
And it would seem that, in their elucidated state&mdash;they harbor no good will towards me.   
  
**Demonic Beast Barbatos:**   
   
  
**Demonic Beast Forneus:**   
Gru...aaaaa...!   
  
**Setanta:**   
The stormy ocean rages all around, no stable footing... Fighting this thing is gonna be a pain.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
...?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Ah, I see... It's a given you would do the same.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
LA?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are you talking about?  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Don't you worry, Master of Chaldea. The cavalry&mdash;no, the coast guard has arrived!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Huh!? There's something rising from the ocean floor!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Ukyaaaaaaaa!?   
  
**Setanta:**   
A ship just surfaced...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That ship...!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's the Golden Hind!  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Indeed! A parting gift from Francis Drake, who waged battle in this level until the very end!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Now, that sunken ship has had life breathed into it once more...!   
  
**Artoria:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
You had no magical energy left, and still you did something like that! Everyone by the name of King Arthur is so irresponsible!   
  
**Draco:**   
I see. They both most certainly lead the Wild Hunt.   
  
**Draco:**   
Most splendidly! In the authority vested in me by my position as Beast, I hereby commandeer this vessel!   
  
**Draco:**   
Demon Beast Incarnadine Gula and Acedia! Your time has run dry. Let the curtain close on this play of yours!   
  
**F：Jack:**   
   
  
**Draco:**   
Why you rebel against me, I will not inquire about&mdash;in the end, it matters not.   
  
**Draco:**   
Whether you have awakened to your own ego, whatever your intention is, it is of no relevance.   
  
**Draco:**   
Such a state is nothing more than an error... A Demon Beast Incarnadine is, after all, simply a part of me.   
  
**F：Jack?:**  
&mdash;That's exactly it, Nero.   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
**F：???:**  
Nero...you're a beloved, part of me, my doll...   
  
**Locusta:**   
...   
  
**Draco:**   
Begone... Return to my bosom at once!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Tiamat:**   
This settles it!   
  
**Jack?:**  
...   
  
**Jack?:**  
&mdash;We don't wanna die.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Silence.   
  
**Draco:**   
...Ow!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeps, are you alright?   
  
**Draco:**   
Fret not, Locusta. This pain is nothing.   
  
**Draco:**   
Two Demon Beast Incarnadines, Gula and Acedia, have returned to me.   
  
**Draco:**   
That makes finally five... Rejoice, Fujimaru.   
  
**Draco:**   
The rebloom of the True Beast is nearly upon you.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Only two Incarnadines remain.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
I know what you mean to say.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
This time, the Incarnadines were openly rebelling against their main body... you, Draco.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
No, they weren't the first.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
We had Ira in the Sixth Singularity trying to drown you in mud.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Then Invidia in the Fifth breaking out of his seal and corroding the Mad King from the inside.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Both cases of Incarnadines acting beyond your designs for them.   
  
**Draco:**   
You speak the truth, Beast of the Planet...   
  
**Draco:**   
The Incarnadines are, by their own will, opposing me.   
  
**Draco:**   
Their rebellion must be related to what has been distorting my Spiral Testament World beyond recognition.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Is this what Georgios and Sita were talking about?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Hmm... Maybe yes, maybe no.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Agh. I hate the way magi talk. So annoying.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Not the Mage of Flowers. I'm the younger sister.   
  
**Locusta:**   
...   
  
**Draco:**   
The Ladder is descending to us.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Are you sure you want to go, Princeps?   
  
**Draco:**   
What are you talking about?   
  
**Locusta:**   
About how...the next Singularity is...   
  
**Draco:**   
You needn't complete that sentence, Locusta.   
  
**Locusta:**   
MY APOLOGIES...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Next is the Second Imitation Singularity...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Ancient Rome.  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Yup. The city built atop Septem Montes. Your place, Draco.   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
And we can be sure an Incarnadine will be awaiting for you there. Deep within you. In the center of your heart.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Are you ready?   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;It matters not.   
  
**Draco:**   
I care nothing about the Incarnadines' rebellion or Septem. Once I devour all, my every problem will be digested with it.   
  
**Draco:**   
There are bigger concerns than I. You, Fujimaru.   
  
**Draco:**   
You are the one who needs to be ready. I am soon to rebloom as Sodom's Beast.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Draco...  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
That will be the end of our wretched contract. Your every effort and devotion shall be properly rewarded.   
  
**Draco:**   
But be at peace. I am a merciful ruler.   
  
**Draco:**   
I shall consume all there is from you and your Chaldea. Down to the marrow of every bone.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Rest assured that Sodom's Beast will keep you company at your deathbed.   
  
## Section 14: Eternal Madness Theater: Septem  
  
**Narration:**   
Her life began at the sunrise. Not as an heir to the Empire but as a distant relative.   
  
**Narration:**   
Perhaps due to the criticisms to her illegitimate ancestry, Nero loved outsiders more than she loved her family.   
  
**Narration:**   
She loved the nameless citizens more than she loved the famed nobles.   
  
**Narration:**   
But no one understood her on a personal level.   
  
**Narration:**   
Despite how she, in an amazing display of knowledge, extinguished a great fire in one night,   
  
**Narration:**   
the people only saw her as the heartless tyrant who executed her own mother.   
  
**Narration:**   
That was her life's second step down the wrong path.   
  
**Narration:**   
Octavia, the wife her mother forcibly married her to, committed suicide.   
  
**Narration:**   
Britannicus, her stepbrother, was assassinated to solidify her political position.   
  
**Narration:**   
And&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**   
“&mdash;My Emperor, you've come a long way.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Perhaps, in discovering your talents, this is also my responsibility.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Back then I saw you as a tiny gem shining laudably. Nowadays, I see only a malignant star.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“You became like a comet shower of calamity&mdash; an all-consuming flame.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“And I was fully aware of this when I reached out for the morning star shining alone in the sky.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“I shouldn't have offered you my hand...or maybe I should have released it from yours.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Not doing so was the most unsalvagably evil, truest act of love to come from within me.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“My teacher, Seneca, I cannot comprehend what you say.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“What infuriates you so?”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Well, no matter. I pardon. However many times it necessitates.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“I allow everything. For I am a tolerant Emperor.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“You do, Princeps? Then grant my request to leave my occupation.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“I shall go somewhere distant. Beyond your reach&mdash;”   
  
**Narration:**   
“...? I am Emperor of Rome. I govern the whole world.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Where is it that I cannot reach?”   
  
**Narration:**   
And so,   
  
**Narration:**   
she drove even the philosopher Seneca, her only teacher, someone she wholeheartedly trusted, to suicide.   
  
**Narration:**   
“Your love won't reach them.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Because you are flame. All you know to do is burn&mdash;”   
  
**Narration:**   
She was eventually ousted from the throne and branded a traitor.   
  
**Narration:**   
What followed that was her greatest miscalculation.   
  
**Narration:**   
She served her citizens, and they, in turn, were pleased with her policies.   
  
**Narration:**   
So she thought the masses would not permit her abdication&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**   
“But nothing happened. They did nothing.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Nothing&mdash;”   
  
**Narration:**   
“&mdash;It's over.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Here comes the setting sun...”   
  
**Narration:**   
“My tutor, I made it... I reached somewhere so distant that my hands can reach no one.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“No further applause. No one is here to attend my deathbed.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“So, Emperor Nero Claudius, what do you have for your epilogue?”   
  
**Draco:**   
Ah...that's what I figured. This is the scene I expected to see.   
  
**Draco:**   
The setting sun...   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Tiamat:**   
No signs of any human presence...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Indeed, it's quite the lonesome scenery...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Almost like a stage that everyone's forgotten.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Even ruins would be an improvement...   
  
**Setanta:**   
I guess ultimately, the two of you ended up coming with us.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Yeah. Considering how clearly rebellious the Incarnadines have gotten, there's no telling what irregularities are in store.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
This is no time for us to fight. Don't you agree, Tiamat?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Simply put, this is all to protect my beloved child, Fujimaru.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
There's no change in the long run with regards to getting rid of Sodom's Beast.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
It is I who shall defeat you. Is that clear, Beast VI!?   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
**Setanta:**   
She's not taking you seriously.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Ugah!   
  
**Setanta:**   
What are you mad at me for?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Where to even begin?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All that aside...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What should we do from this point?  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
We're smack dab in the middle of a plain. For now, I take it we're headed for Rome?   
  
**Draco:**   
Not at all.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Huh...?   
  
**Draco:**   
Not any city or country. This scenery itself is the Second Imitation Singularity.   
  
**Draco:**   
Merely the scenery of the setting sun, continuing without end&mdash;   
  
**Locusta:**   
Now I see...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Then this is the last view you took in, Princeps...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So that means this is...  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So that means this is...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
the place I came to before with Nero.  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
What do you mean? Explain in a way I can understand.   
  
**Draco:**   
This is the emperor Nero's resting place, where Nero Claudius stabbed herself in the throat.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I'm sorry.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Awfully honest...   
  
**Draco:**   
Pay it no mind... That story is of no worth.   
  
**Draco:**   
I see. You heard as much from my foolish self&mdash;the Nero of Chaldea.   
  
**Draco:**   
To think she would be exposing such shame of her own volition. Rather like sealing a bond, don't you agree?   
  
**Draco:**   
That's right. This is my resting place, where Nero Claudius stabbed herself in the throat.   
  
**Locusta:**   
...   
  
**Draco:**   
It was a disgraceful end.   
  
**Draco:**   
Hearing impossible sounds of applause and clinging to impossible hopes for salvation, she died miserably, covered in blood and tears.   
  
**Draco:**   
Therefore, this scenery has to be the place.   
  
**Draco:**   
Is the Demon Beast Incarnadine trying to get under my skin, much like in London...?   
  
**Draco:**   
An insufferable trick, but no longer effective. The same tactic will not work twice over.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
...!? It's coming...!   
  
**Demonic Beast Flauros:**   
AH... AAH, AAAAAAAAAAAH!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
An Incarnadine!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The Fake Demon God Pillar, Flauros!  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
It was waiting to come out, huh...?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Seems so. Let's make ourselves scarce quickly.   
  
**Demonic Beast Flauros:**   
aH... The pAIn... THE PaIIIIN...!   
  
**Demonic Beast Flauros:**   
My head feels as though...it's splitting apart...!   
  
**Setanta:**   
It doesn't even have a head to ache... What's it talking about?   
  
**Locusta:**   
...   
  
**Demonic Beast Flauros:**   
...Such flimsy seals... Such flimsy poison...is not enough to hold me back...!   
  
**Demonic Beast Flauros:**   
I&mdash;   
  
**Demonic Beast Flauros:**   
I reject my demise. I refuse the curtain call. I rebel against the setting sun.   
  
**Demonic Beast Flauros:**   
We are the Beast's seven crowns. We are the dragon's seven heads. I, Demon Beast Incarnadine Superbia, shall under heels of pride trample all!   
  
**Draco:**   
Hmph, how disagreeable. This is indeed what it's like to have one's hand bitten by a pet dog.   
  
**Draco:**   
I have no ears to hear you. Such futility is not to my liking.   
  
**Draco:**   
Heel before my feet, Superbia!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We defeated it...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Yes... I can confirm Superbia has returned to me.   
  
**Setanta:**   
This one felt like it was over before it started.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Speak for yourself. It was grueling hard.   
  
**Locusta:**   
You Celt muscleheads are always so inconsiderate.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
With Mother by your side, there is no enemy you can't take on. Hehe!   
  
**Draco:**   
The Demon Beast Incarnadines are ultimately parts of me. They are too predictable to be a threat.   
  
**Draco:**   
There is nothing left holding us to this unpleasant place.   
  
**Draco:**   
Let us move ahead. The next Singularity is the last, Orleans.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But the Ladder...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
isn't here yet.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
...!? MY HEAD...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Draco?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What happened?  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
&ndash;Ah...Ahh&mdash;  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Ah...gah...aaaaAaAaah!   
  
**Narration:**   
“My hands shake and my sight blurs.”   
  
**Draco:**   
Stop...   
  
**Narration:**   
“Someone... Will anyone attend my deathbed?”   
  
**Draco:**   
Make it stop...   
  
**Narration:**   
“Can't you see I am going to die...!?”   
  
**???:**  
&mdash;I must cut you down.   
  
**Draco:**   
You....   
  
**Nero:**   
Tyrant's dream roaming the wasteland! Flower of prosperity that forgot to wilt!   
  
**Nero:**   
Ghost of the Emperor Nero yet to accept the falling curtain, come forth and take up your sword!   
  
**Ghost:**   
&mdash;    
  
**Nero:**   
I might be a bit late&mdash;but I shall right my wrongs with my own sword!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**A：???:**  
It is here. I still remember the shape of the rocks, the sound of the wind, and the rotten color of the setting sun.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh...?  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What am I...?  
  
  
---  
  
**A：???:**  
I remember every detail of how an emperor lost her life in this wasteland.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nero...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No... I remember this...  
  
  
---  
  
**Nero:**   
Nero did not die so easily.   
  
**Nero:**   
She tried to, but couldn't... Her throat suffocated. Her heart hurt. Her eyes burned.   
  
**Nero:**   
Nero's pursuers couldn't find her until after the thrice-setting sun&mdash;   
  
**Ghost:**   
&mdash;    
  
**Nero:**   
The Fifth Emperor, Nero Claudius, implores you! My Master, Fujimaru!   
  
**Nero:**   
Lend me your strength! I might be a bit late, but I shall right my wrongs with my own sword!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't know what you're doing...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Explain yourself.  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Was that...a hallucination?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Or was it Draco's...  
  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
Dangnabbit.   
  
**Locusta:**   
I forgot Lord Master isn't affected by poison. Now that's a blunder.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Locusta?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What did you...  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
It is what it is. It's 100% not my style, but I'll have to do it by force.   
  
**Locusta:**   
&mdash;Lord Master,   
  
**Locusta:**   
I need you to die. Doesn't have to be by poison.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What&mdash;  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Hold up, I can't let that slide.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Ugh... Another one immune to poison?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Not exactly.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
It's more that dreams and hallucination just so happen to be my forte.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
LA!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can you handle this?  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Ahahaha... No, she got me good.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
So it'd be so nice if everyone regained their senses... about now.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Oh, you're an annoying one to deal with. Well, the poison is still inside them.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Hey...Shrooms...! What the hell was that all about?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Now that's a funny question. Weren't you the one telling me all the time I'm your enemy?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Uh... I don't feel too good...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Beast or not, you're using a deteriorated Saint Graph. My poison should be doing a big number on you.   
  
**Setanta:**   
What the hell.. This poison...is leagues beyond anything you used before...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Shouldn't be any surprise. The Septem Singularity is my home base, after all.   
  
**Locusta:**   
&mdash;That's how it is with Floor Guardian privileges.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Wh...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Locusta is the...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Floor Guardian?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
   
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeps... You won't have to bear the pain for much longer. All will be over in just a few moments.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
What are...you doing...?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Killing the Princeps, of course.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Okay... That's what I thought.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
You're a properly summoned Servant, aren't you?   
  
**Locusta:**   
I am. Assassin, Locusta. Floor Guardian of the Second Imitation Singularity&mdash;   
  
**Locusta:**   
A Servant summoned to the Spiral Testament World to exterminate Sodom's Beast.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
...! Fujimaru! Step away!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Oh, you don't have to... Personally, I don't care in the slightest about the Beast's contractor part.   
  
**Locusta:**   
That said, this Second Singularity's Incarnadine is another thing I never gave proper attention.   
  
**Locusta:**   
All that matters is Emperor Nero.   
  
**Locusta:**   
But just to make sure none of you will disturb my work...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Tsk, enemies...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Fight for your life while I finish this.   
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Setanta:**   
Ggh...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Hey, hey! What's with those shaky knees of yours?   
  
**Setanta:**   
You pest!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Locusta...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's with you all of a sudden?  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
I needed time to fulfill all the conditions.   
  
**Locusta:**   
The lock won't open anywhere other than Septem&mdash;Only here on the Second Imitation Singularity's wastelands, the site of the Princeps' end.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
A lock?   
  
**Locusta:**   
As I said.   
  
**Locusta:**   
A lock to the Princeps&mdash; To Sodom's Beast's Secret Garden&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...!?  
  
  
---  
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
SG...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It sounds kind of familiar...  
  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
SG...or Secret Garden. The secret hidden deep within Draco's heart.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
It really isn't something that should be opened in this manner, though.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
This is the Second Imitation Singularity. On top of that, we have the pecularities of the Spiral Testament World itself.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
And most importantly, Locusta, the special Floor Guardian&mdash;   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
It's the combination of these conditions that will now lead to the unearthing of this secret garden.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So why are you here, LA?  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
I am a succubus, you know. On the contrary, you're the outlier here.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
We're within Draco's mind&mdash;   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Right now, you are descending deeper and deeper into the depths of her heart.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
I don't know how you managed to enter Draco's mindscape, though.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Maybe it's because you've made a contract with Draco. Or maybe someone guided you here&ndash;   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So what does it mean exactly?  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
An SG is what a person wishes to keep concealed. For instance, a scarred mind. Or a unique interest or predilection.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
The revelation of these secrets will lead to the removal of the walls in her heart. A vulnerable heart will be laid bare.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
And now, we are diving into the depths of Draco's mind to find that secret.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
I don't know how you managed to enter Draco's mindscape, though.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Maybe it's because you've made a contract with Draco. Or maybe someone guided you here&ndash;   
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
I shall serve as this dream's navigator. Be sure not to leave my side, Big [♂ Bro /♀️ Sis].   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What happened with Locusta?  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
All the Servants in this Spiral Testament World were summoned to hunt Sodom's Beast.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
It just means that Locusta is no exception.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Let's hurry... She's headed into the depths of Draco's mind just like we are.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
She most likely intends to unleash her secret weapon there.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Her affection for Draco, though...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't think that was a lie.  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Yes&mdash;   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Locusta was a poisoner in the service of Emperor Nero. She was someone who knew the darkness within her.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
It must've been complicated in many ways... The only way to find out is to confront it.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
What Locusta has seen is, in other words, the half of Emperor Nero's life that was dyed in blood and poison.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Are you prepared, Master of Chaldea?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Nod vigorously)  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go meet the two of them.  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Nicely answered. Now then, hold on tight&mdash;   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Spiral drop, start! Just kidding...!   
  
## Section 15: Throw the Pain into the Fire, Throw the Affection into the Fire  
  
**A：???:**  
&mdash;Locusta.   
  
**Locusta:**   
...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Yes, Princeps. I am here.   
  
**Nero:**   
...Ah...ugh... My head feels...like it is splitting...   
  
**Nero:**   
Locusta... The medicine... Give it quickly...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
...   
  
**Nero:**   
Surely you are...able to make more...?   
  
**Nero:**   
The poison my mother...dosed with me with... I need more antidote...to stop the headaches...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
I... I am so sorry, Princeps.   
  
**Locusta:**   
It's already too late... You were made to drink that poison from too young an age.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Even with Lady Agrippina's antidote, the headaches can no longer be...   
  
**E：Nero:**   
Locusta...why...   
  
**Locusta:**   
I-I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I'm sorryyy...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
D-Defying her just wasn't possible...   
  
**Locusta:**   
I found...Lady Agrippina...just so terrifying...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Those muddy eyes...that seem to swallow up everything...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
So I...did what I was told...   
  
**???:**  
Emperor Nero suffered all of her life from headaches.   
  
**???:**  
People said that the cause was her preference for silver cups. Or that it was a chronic hysteria.   
  
**???:**  
But the truth is&mdash;   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Locusta&mdash;You were the one who administered the poison.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
On orders from Agrippina, Emperor Nero's mother.   
  
**Locusta:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeps. This is the only measure that remains to cease your torments.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A golden jewel box?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Its contents...  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Here in this place, her heart of hearts, all these conditions satisfied will finally make it appear.   
  
**Locusta:**   
My crowning achievement, yet my weakest Noble Phantasm&mdash;   
  
**Locusta:**   
Goodbye, Emperor I Loved Finis Venenum Nero.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
A medicinal poison, huh...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
And this poison is your secret weapon?  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
It's not that big a deal.   
  
**Locusta:**   
This is a poison that ends life without suffering. Nothing more than that, really; a powerless Noble Phantasm.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But one for euthanasia...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why would you have that?  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Come, Princeps. Take it&mdash;   
  
**E：Nero:**   
&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Stop, Locusta!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Snap out of it, Draco!  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Master, you mustn't!   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Ngh!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
...! Draco, are you...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why, Draco?  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Woah... That counts as sexual harassment, Lord Master.   
  
**Locusta:**   
This is a maiden's secret hidden and locked away. Isn't it obvious that she'd want our hands kept off?   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
You don't need to be frightened, Master of Chaldea.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
This building a wall around her heart means that she's seeking rescue in its deepest level.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
It's not enough to be gentle about it. Sometimes it requires the forceful approach.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Gyah! Again with the sexual harassment! Get your good sense a proper update!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Please...do not disturb us again, Lord Master.   
  
**Locusta:**   
It took me so much to seize this miracle. Our Deus ex Machina ending...   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
These are Draco's memories.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's...the other Chaldea.  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Then...the very act of competing for the Holy Grail resulted in Beast VI's growth...!?   
  
**Narration:**   
“&mdash;Correct. As a result, you lot have reached this realm.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“The graveyard of many prosperities. A banquet table adorned by the rot of many Human Orders.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“This realm isn't just 'the end of some history'. It prophesies the end of your human history.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“&ndash;In other words, this is a fate written in stone that your world will reach in a few years from now.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“I am the one who savors that end. For fruits are best savored when they are on the verge of rotting.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“You have no cause to defy me, given that you have beheld the future. O Earthlings, perish before my fangs.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“You have my gratitude too. You did well 'getting this far' once more.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Chaldea may have raised me, but it is an inevitability of the Human Order to beckon the apocalypse.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“For Beasts are weak, and alone they cannot scar the world.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Only you humans are capable of destroying the world.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“This repulsive scenery is what the masses desired.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“I am merely a Beast revelling in it. This outcome is one not even I can change.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“So hold your heads high. That desire has led to the completion of humanity's extermination here.”   
  
**Mash:**   
The desire of the masses... To find greater enjoyment. To live in greater comfort.   
  
**Mash:**   
Born from this inclination of humanity's is the self-ruination that lies at the end of prosperity.   
  
**Mash:**   
I understand that. It is an inevitability of life. So&mdash;that in itself is not evil.   
  
**Mash:**   
I understand that it's not evil.   
  
**Narration:**   
“&mdash;Is that so? Then what is evil to you?”   
  
**Mash:**   
People's lives. Their feelings. Their memories. The ones who ridicule these are evil.   
  
**Mash:**   
If this scenery lies at the end of the Human Order, then we shall continue to move forward, seeking it.   
  
**Mash:**   
However!   
  
**Mash:**   
I will not accept you, who treat those as mere amusements!   
  
**Mash:**   
Beast VI! Beast of Calamity!   
  
**Mash:**   
At a place elsewhere, at a Chaldea that is not our own,   
  
**Mash:**   
“someone” fought until the very end! To not lose to them, this “Chaldea” here will defeat you!   
  
**Narration:**   
“&mdash;”   
  
**???:**  
I've been informed of everything by Rider, Noah!   
  
**???:**  
I am one who hunts the Beast. The wanderer on a journey across the many worlds.   
  
**Arthur:**   
&mdash;My True Name is Arthur Pendragon!   
  
**Arthur:**   
When L and R are both present, so too will S and G manifest under either sky...   
  
**Arthur:**   
Know that the Holy Sword of the Planet will not let you escape&ndash;even if we are worlds apart.   
  
**Arthur:**   
That avarice! That pride!   
  
**Arthur:**   
I shall close the curtains on them on this very day, at this very moment, at this very place!   
  
**Arthur:**   
&mdash;Beast VI, Sodom's Beast!   
  
**First Hassan:**   
&mdash;   
  
**First Hassan:**   
O beast of depravity. O dragon who partakes of filth from the golden grail. The sound of that bell&mdash;   
  
**First Hassan:**   
Nay. The radiance of that star. Have you witnessed it once more? With those gleaming childlike eyes of yours.   
  
**Merlin:**   
Two Grand Heroic Spirits plus the Knight of the Holy Sword, a Beast slayer who traverses the worlds.   
  
**Merlin:**   
The end is in sight. The Chaldea that you have preyed upon so many times now,   
  
**Merlin:**   
will bare their fangs at you right at the very end! Go on, grumble and protest!   
  
**Mash:**   
T-then, you're...   
  
**Mash:**   
Out of curiosity&mdash;   
  
**Mash:**   
The world&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**   
“What an inelegant way of phrasing it. Here's how you put it into words beautifully:”   
  
**Narration:**   
# “Desire!!”   
  
**Mash:**   
Right... Right, Master! We have to stop her!   
  
**Mash:**   
Right here! Right now!   
  
**Narration:**   
“&mdash;Hah. Haha.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!”   
  
**Narration:**   
“That's what makes you so appetizing, mankind! The flesh of love that never rots&ndash;”   
  
**Narration:**   
I offer you all I have and steal all you have. Love to me is a blazing flame.   
  
**Narration:**   
All is accepted and all is permitted. I hear that love to others is healing.   
  
**Narration:**   
Like the warm rays of the midday sun&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**   
But I couldn't comprehend it no matter how I tried...   
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;The love they spoke of            never made sense to me&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
So I am alone&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
No one is applauding. No one is attending my deathbed.   
  
**Draco:**   
Ah&mdash;this reminds me of&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
The setting sun...   
  
**Narration:**   
The first setting sun&mdash;I opened my eyes upon hearing a voice call my name.   
  
**Narration:**   
The voice of one of my beloved citizens ovating their Emperor.   
  
**Narration:**   
The second setting sun&mdash;another auditory hallucination.   
  
**Narration:**   
I lifted my eyelids to find no one in the wastelands.   
  
**Narration:**   
And then, the third setting sun&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**   
“You will never reach the stars.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“Because you are a blood-colored rose, born with the sunrise and bound to shed your last petal with the setting sun.”   
  
**Nero:**   
My hands shake and my sight blurs.   
  
**Nero:**   
Someone... Will anyone attend my deathbed?   
  
**Nero:**   
Can't you see I am going to die...!?   
  
**Narration:**   
Ultimately, I reached the abyss of death without anyone loving me.   
  
**Narration:**   
Crying and crying again,   
  
**Narration:**   
I pressed the knife to my throat&mdash;   
  
**Nero:**   
Emperor Nero still... I still...don't...!   
  
**Nero:**   
want to d&ndash;   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Stop.   
  
**B：Draco:**   
The theater's curtains are long since lowered, and there is no one left in the audience.   
  
**B：Draco:**   
The actor cannot refuse to leave the stage under such circumstances.   
  
**B：Draco:**   
My Holy Grail...   
  
**B：Draco:**   
Grant me the epilogue I surely deserve&mdash;

**Fujimaru 1:**   
&mdash;(Suicidal urges)  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Draco was the one who summoned her enemies?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Locusta:**   
Correct...   
  
**Scáthach:**   
Cease your bravado, Sodom's Beast. You've long since lost your taste for these things.   
  
**Scáthach:**   
That we are more alike than you think. We share the same desire, you and I...   
  
**Scáthach:**   
&mdash;A ■■■■■ ■■■■.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
&mdash;A death wish.  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
We're not Servants summoned by the Human Order to defeat Beast VI.   
  
**Locusta:**   
We're Servants that Beast VI summoned to kill herself.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then why  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
am I being held hostage?  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
The Incarnadines did it... To everyone's surprise, they have their own egos.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Draco seemed to believe this was an subconscious act from the notoriously sore loser Nero.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
And she wasn't completely wrong. The Incarnadines are, in fact, extensions of her.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
But about you, Master, you're the factor that completely threw the plan off track.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
You were taken taken away from Chaldea and forced into a contract with the Beast.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
From the very start, Draco only followed through with this journey to save you after you were unnecessarily made part of this.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then what does she mean...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
when she talks about reblooming as a Beast?  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
She needs one of the Beast's Skills, Independent Manifestation, to annul her contract to you.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
She wasn't lying about it. She's not trying to regain her power and her true form, though.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Draco is planning to die. So she can put an end to her play.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But that's...  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
I will, without question, grant any wish Emperor Nero desires of me...   
  
**Locusta:**   
But... I can't take it happening like this...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
All alone in this Spiral Testament World! Hunted for sport like a filthy beast!   
  
**Locusta:**   
It would be no different...from the final moments of the thrice-setting sun...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
The Princeps is too beautiful to deserve such an atrocious ending!   
  
**Locusta:**   
I'm... I'm the only one who can end the Princeps' life the ideal way!   
  
**Locusta:**   
With my Noble Phantasm: Finis Venenum Nero&mdash;   
  
**Locusta:**   
A poison I made specifically for her. Meant only for the noblest lady in the entire world.   
  
**Locusta:**   
In the glorious rose's final moments&mdash; I will be granting her a peaceful slumber, tender as candlelight&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait, Locusta!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you sure that's what you want?  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
You have my apologies, Master, but I can't let this opportunity go to waste.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Now, accept this poison, Princeps.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
Oh&mdash;there you are, Locusta.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Yes... Yes... It's me. It's Locusta, always by your side.   
  
**Draco:**   
You were too late, but ah, such fidelity.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeps...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Draco! Locusta!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is this really...  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Ah... How warm... Wonderful, even...   
  
**Draco:**   
The zenith of poisons&mdash;one produced only out of care for Nero. Love of the highest purity.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;This supreme poison is the drink most appropriate to fill my golden chalice.   
  
**Locusta:**   
...Huh...?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Prin...ceps?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Master!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Tiamat:**   
Fujimaru! You're back!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm back outside!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's going on!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
That's my line. What the hell happened in there?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Prin...ceps...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Holy shit, Shrooms! You're in shambles!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Aaaaah! Let Mother handle this! I'll take care of my hurt baby!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Master, look over there.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's not acting normal.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And I'm feeling something  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Our chalice was once again filled with poison.   
  
**Draco:**   
The time for our birth as Sodom's Beast is upon us.   
  
**Draco:**   
Come, join us, Beast's contractor. Our Master.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
"Our"?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
not Draco, are you?  
  
  
---  
  
**A：Draco?:**  
We&mdash;   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Not on my watch!   
  
**A：Draco?:**  
We are the Beast's seven crowns. We are the dragon's seven heads. I, Demon Beast Incarnadine Luxuria shall in colors of lust dye all.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I don't like where this is going... I smell Beast VI but not Draco!   
  
**A：Draco?:**  
I, Demon Beast Incarnadine Ira&ndash;shall in flames of wrath scorch all!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Yup... It's exactly what you two thought it was.   
  
**A：Draco?:**  
I, Demon Beast Incarnadine Invidia&ndash;shall in crazes of envy madden all!   
  
**Setanta:**   
You don't think the guys inside her are...!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
It was a trap.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Demon Beast Incarnadines Luxuria, Ira, Invidia,   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Gula, Acedia, and Superbia&mdash;   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
The six Incarnadines she retrieved are rebelling from within.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Draco was supposed to be the main body of the Beast, but the Incarnadines hijacked her.   
  
**A：Demonic Beast Draco:**   
It cannot end here. It cannot end like this,   
  
**A：Demonic Beast Draco:**   
At the bottom of that lifeless place, with no one attending my deathbed.   
  
**A：Demonic Beast Draco:**   
I reject my demise. I refuse the curtain call. I&mdash;   
  
**A：Demonic Beast Draco:**   
We Demon Beast Incarnadines&mdash; rebel against the setting sun.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
&mdash;Fujimaru!   
  
**A：Demonic Beast Draco:**   
&mdash;We'll be waiting for you, Fujimaru.   
  
**A：Demonic Beast Draco:**   
In the First Imitation Singularity&mdash; The land of the beginning and the end, Orleans.   
  
## Section 16: ■■■■ War ■■■ Dragons: ■■■■■ (1/2)  
  
**Narration:**   
At the first setting sun, an impossible illusion had caused her nose to run.   
  
**Narration:**   
At the second setting sun, a call from voices unheard made her bite her lip.   
  
**Narration:**   
And then, at the third setting sun&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**   
What thought dwelled in her mind, as she was chased from Rome, only to succumb in the wilderness?   
  
**Narration:**   
Lamentations for her own dying days? Loathing for the rebels?   
  
**Narration:**   
Or perhaps&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**   
Did she curse the people she had done so much for, yet not one of whom had come to her aid?   
  
**Narration:**   
“&mdash;No, not that. What happened was unavoidable.”   
  
**Narration:**   
“There is sorrow, but I bear no grudges&mdash;”   
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;I am not ready to die. &mdash;I do not want to die.   
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;I have done nothing wrong.   
  
**Narration:**   
I remember; how crimson the setting sun dyed the wilderness.   
  
**Narration:**   
I remember; how crimson the blood flowed from my throat.   
  
**Narration:**   
I will not forget; the chill of the blade that slipped into my throat as I shook with dread.   
  
**Narration:**   
I will not forget; the heat of the blood as it poured out as though set ablaze.   
  
**Narration:**   
&mdash;How could I forgive this?   
  
**Narration:**   
It matters not if they would denounce us as a tyrant&mdash;or the Whore of Babylon.   
  
**Narration:**   
If that be so, we will be the Beast mankind wishes us to be.   
  
**Narration:**   
Every last thing. Far and wide. Anything and everything.   
  
**Narration:**   
&ndash;Every city, every trace of Rome, shall be razed wholly. Utterly. Fully. Completely.   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Ladder's descended.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where did Draco go?  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
I can't detect her... Though I am certain she's left the Second Singularity.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
There's no doubt that she's gone up to the next floor. To free the final Demon Beast Incarnadine, that is.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
It's what the Incarnadines have been waiting for all along. For a fatal gap to open up in Draco's heart.   
  
**Setanta:**   
And THIS is the result?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Flames all around...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Not just the Second Singularity. The entire Spiral Testament World is on fire.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
The Demon Beast Incarnadines are making an attempt at rebirth using the energy borne of burning a world.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
&mdash;As the new and true form of Sodom's Beast, replacing Draco.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This is why the Incarnadines rebelled?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
As I feared...  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Yes...because Draco intended on dying.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Consider Mother shocked. To think Beast VI was such a resolute Beast...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Quite the moody tyrant, that one...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
She's the Beast of Depravity, yet she despises sloth. She feeds on greed yet she despises corruption.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
But the Demon Beast Incarnadines could not let that slide&mdash;   
  
**Setanta:**   
No wonder there were so many irregularities.   
  
**Setanta:**   
I mean, the Incarnadines were hostile towards us in every Singularity.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Locusta was the final trigger.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
The poison meant to euthanize Emperor Nero. The love crafted solely with Emperor Nero in mind.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
A masterpiece of a poison&mdash;the perfect feast for the Beast with a poisoned grail.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Draco was put to sleep by the poison, and it is by that poison that the Incarnadines seek to gain power.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
In time, Draco's very existence will be overwritten entirely into that of a Demon Beast Incarnadine.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...How's Locusta doing?  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
She's beaten up pretty badly, but she's fine. She'll live.   
  
**Setanta:**   
So what're you going to do with Shrooms here, Master?   
  
**Setanta:**   
No matter her circumstances, it remains a fact that she did betray us&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
For now, let's just...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Keep moving up.  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
Got it...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Right you are, we've got no time left to spare.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Let's hurry, to the final Singularity&mdash; The First Imitation Singularity of Orleans!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
   
  
**Demonic Beast Draco:**   
Farewell, Dragon Witch.   
  
**Demonic Beast Draco:**   
We shall on your behalf answer your eagerly grasping prayers. The vengeful wishes you could not fulfill.   
  
**Demonic Beast Draco:**   
&mdash;We shall set the world ablaze.   
  
**Demonic Beast Naberius:**   
I am&mdash;   
  
**Demonic Beast Naberius:**   
I reject my demise. I refuse the curtain call. I rebel against the setting sun.   
  
**Demonic Beast Naberius:**   
We are the Beast's seven crowns. We are the dragon's seven heads. I, Demon Beast Incarnadine Avaritia, shall in cravings of greed covet all.   
  
**Demonic Beast Draco:**   
&mdash;Here are we gathered, the seven crowns of the Beast.   
  
**Demonic Beast Naberius:**   
Lust. Wrath. Envy, Gluttony. Sloth. Pride. Greed&mdash;   
  
**Demonic Beast Naberius:**   
Fill my chalice with desires to blot out all the heavens. Spill upon and overflow my banquet table.   
  
**Demonic Beast Naberius:**   
Ring out jubilations and curses. &mdash;The rebirth of Sodom's Beast is upon you!   
  
**Locusta:**   
...Huh...Am I...?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're awake?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you hurt anywhere?  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Lord Master...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Um...well...that is...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're inside the Ladder.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Now headed for the First Singularity.  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
What happened to the Princeps...?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She isn't here...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She's possessed by the Incarnadines.  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Ah...! Not that...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Ah... Ah... Aah, aaaaaaah!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Once again... I still couldn't save the Princeps...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
If only...I'd have been able to kill her!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why would you go to such lengths?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
For Draco's sake, I mean...  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Goodbye, Emperor I Loved&mdash; Finis Venenum Nero.   
  
**Locusta:**   
The poison I prepared in my lifetime for the Princeps before her final moments...   
  
**Locusta:**   
It was handed to her at the time of her expulsion from Rome.   
  
**Locusta:**   
It would have given her peace in her last moments, but...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She didn't drink the poison.  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Weeping... Suffering... Dying while choking on her own blood...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Why did she have to die...such a cruel death...?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Why did the Princeps...turn down my poison...?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't really know.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I suppose for Draco...  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
...?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Having had a life so stained with poison,  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
maybe she didn't want it to end the same way.  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Aha...ahaha.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Ultimately, I only brought the Princeps suffering...   
  
**Locusta:**   
A lowly, bloody-handed killer who thought she could save her... How presumptuous of me...   
  
**Locusta:**   
&mdash;It was me who was her most toxic poison.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What exactly...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
are you wishing for Draco, Locusta?  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
All I want...is for the Princeps to be at peace...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not true.  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Huh...?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's not your real wish, is it?  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Please, Locusta.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Give me your hand.  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go save Draco.  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Ugh...   
  
**Setanta:**   
What's up, traitor?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Ugh... Ugggh...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Setantaaa...  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
What, Master? Got any complaints?   
  
**Setanta:**   
I've been calling her the enemy from the start. I said as much plenty of times.   
  
**Setanta:**   
So? Where do you go from here, Shrooms?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Where... What do you&ndash;   
  
**Setanta:**   
I'm asking if you're willing to fight here. We've been united this far in needing to stop the Incarnadines, haven't we?   
  
**Setanta:**   
We were enemies from the get-go, travelling together only on account of a common interest.   
  
**Setanta:**   
In which case, nothing's really changed, has it? Things remain the same as they always have.   
  
**Locusta:**   
...   
  
**Locusta:**   
I'll do it... I'll put up a fight.   
  
**Locusta:**   
We'll save the Princeps by kicking the shit out of those Incarnadines...!   
  
**Setanta:**   
That settles that. I appreciated a little show of aggression. Put on a tough face, Shrooms.   
  
**Locusta:**   
To think you had such a nice side, you Celt crap-for-brains. Can I interest you in some mushrooms as thanks?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Are they edible?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Just the normal poison.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Thanks. I really do hold you in contempt.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Hehe. Have we all reached a consensus?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If you all wouldn't mind.  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That goes for you too, Tiamat.  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
Yeah...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Tiamat... You've learned about Draco's true intentions.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
How will the former Beast II face Beast VI?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Are the fellow Beasts truly incompatible. Or are they&mdash;   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
I'll be watching what conclusion you bring about.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Locusta:**   
The Ladder's come to a stop...   
  
**Setanta:**   
We're finally here...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Here's the last stop of the journey.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Our final Singularity.  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go, guys!

## Section 16: ■■■■ War ■■■ Dragons: ■■■■■ (2/2)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The enemies this time...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...are completely unrecognizable.  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
This looks worse than expected. The First Imitation Singularity is completely wrecked.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Not a sign of the old Singularity structure left. I wouldn't even call this place Orleans.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Look over there.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Mud dripping down from the heavens...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
The Spiral Testament World's energy takes the form of pouring mud.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Producing the nutrients necessary for Sodom's Beast's true body to be born&mdash;   
  
**Setanta:**   
Hey, look closer at the center of the sea of mud.   
  
**Locusta:**   
As if I could. It's way too far. Your eyes are not normal.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I see her!   
  
**Tiamat=spot:**   
&mdash;Beast VI!   
  
**Locusta=spot:**   
PRINCEEEEEEEPS!?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
She's being force-fed the mud... I don't like the look of that.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
The true Sodom's Beast really will be back if we don't stop this.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
If Sodom's Beast were to use the Incarnadines' souls as its core, then the actual Draco would dissolve beyond repair.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We've gotta hurry and save her!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm counting on all of you!  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
Yeah... We've reached the endgame. It's up to us to stop Sodom's Beast now!   
  
**Locusta:**   
I won't fail again... I won't fail you again, Princeps!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Setanta:**   
What's wrong, Tiamat?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
It's too late to save that child.   
  
**Locusta:**   
What did you say!?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
But she's defenseless now. I can kill her before she becomes the true Sodom's Beast.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Oh, c'mon...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Well, actually, I can't deny it... That would be the right call...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Hooooold on!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I know Sodom's Beast is not a bad beast anymore.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
But if she becomes a True Beast, she will no longer be the child we know.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
This is what we can do before worse comes to worst&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Tiamat...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Please...  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Please&mdash;   
  
**Setanta:**   
Shrooms...   
  
**Locusta:**   
Please, goddess Tiamat. Save my Princeps.   
  
**L：Tiamat:**   
Ugh... but...   
  
**Locusta:**   
There is nothing I can do. Nothing I have to offer.   
  
**Locusta:**   
So I can only pray. Only depend on others.   
  
**Locusta:**   
But please...please...   
  
**Locusta:**   
I beg you! Save Emperor Nero...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
I...don't want her to die!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
What do you say, Tiamat? Tell us your answer.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I don't know... Mother doesn't know a thing.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Beasts are enemies of mankind... but...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Tiamat&mdash;I won't let you kill her, if that's what you're intending.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Setanta...   
  
**Setanta:**   
You'll also try to help Draco, won't you, Master?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Nodding vigorously)  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Of course!  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
Figured.   
  
**Setanta:**   
I know the Master over at my place would have answered the same.   
  
**Setanta:**   
That's the whole reason why I can entrust my sword to you.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Setantaaaaah! Bweeeeeeeeeeh!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Hey! Cut that crying crap!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Tiamat...?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Ooooh...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
If I ever feel like there's no other way, I'll defeat her... no matter what any of you say.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
But until then...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's fine for now.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thank you.  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Are you ready? Then it's full speed ahead.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
I paved a road for us! One step off of it and you're dead, so be very careful!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Bugger off! Drop out of our way!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Setanta:**   
&mdash;We're through!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just...a little more!  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeeeeeeeeeeps!   
  
**F：???:**  
&mdash;Cease your disrespect, vulgar poison-feeder.   
  
**Locusta:**   
...!?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Shrooms!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Who goes there?   
  
**???:**  
&mdash;I, Demon Beast Incarnadine Luxuria, shall in colors of lust dye all.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
...!? I know this smell and presence!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Yeah, no doubts about it. These children are... Demon Beast Incarnadines!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Humanoid Incarnadines!  
  
  
---  
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
We are horns of the beast no longer. We are heads of the dragon no longer. We are Sodom's Beast, nothing more and nothing less.   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
And&mdash;well journey'd making it to our side, my contractor, Fujimaru.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Incarnadines!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are you doing to Draco  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Give our Princeps back!   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
You're too late, poison-feeder. Nero was touched by your poison.   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
Our main body shan't ever awaken from its slumber.   
  
**Locusta:**   
...!   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
You know that better than anyone&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There's still time!  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
You know nothing about my Master if you thought [♂ he /♀️ she] would simply nod and give up.   
  
**Setanta:**   
A person like that could never save the Human Order. Ever thought about that?   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
Indeed&mdash;I comprehend it quite well.   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
Which is why we are doing this to Draco&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
It is almost there. Soon enough, the poisoned chalice will be filled with mud.   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
Our True Beast body will hatch from the chrysalis that is Draco.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Not on my watch!   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
Avaritia. Invidia.   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
Celebrate. This ceremony marks our rebirth. The rebirth of Sodom's Beast.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Graaawr!   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ghhhhhh...!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Dracoooooooo!  
  
  
---  
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
You fought well, my contractor. But this is as far as we go.   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
&mdash;Look around you. This is the end of your journey.   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
The spiral stops rising before it reaches Heaven.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
We have to do something! The road isn't going to last like this!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Draco is going to...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Sodom's Beast is going to awaken!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I have to kill Draco now...!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeps! Princeeeeeeeeeps!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
...Hnng!   
  
**Jack:**   
Hey, don't leave us alone.   
  
**Jack:**   
Give us warmth.   
  
**Jack:**   
It's so cold here.   
  
**Jack:**   
&mdash;Because we don't wanna die.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Oh, right. That was Draco&mdash;   
  
**Tiamat:**   
&mdash;She's a crying child.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
It's no good... My path...won't hold out...!   
  
**Draco?:**  
!   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
Ha... HAhaHA... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
THE ROMAN WORLD WILL GO UP IN FLAME! ROMAN HISTORY WILL GO UP IN FLAME!   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
Let us hear thunderous applause for our hell!   
  
## Section 17: The Reality of the Dried Up Voice of Hope  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm perfectly fine?  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
We're...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Not getting swallowed by the mud...huh.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Don't worry.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I'll keep the mud away.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Of course. You have the power of the Chaos Tide.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You really saved us here.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thank you, Tiamat.  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
...   
  
**Setanta:**   
We're still not in a good place, though.   
  
**Locusta:**   
The Princeps' Domus Aurea...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
The Noble Phantasm of Sodom's Beast. She's awakened. We're out of time, it seems...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that the true Sodom's Beast?  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
The Sodom's Beast we fought in the other Chaldea looked...different.   
  
**Setanta:**   
The one we fought looked like a Draco with MUCH bigger curves all around.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Meaning, that one isn't Draco on the inside?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
It's a new Sodom's Beast using the Incarnadines as its core. Draco is no longer there.   
  
**Locusta:**   
No... Princeps...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is it too late for us?  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
No! Noooooo!   
  
**Setanta:**   
...Tiamat?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Fujimaru! You mustn't give up!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Tiamat, what are you...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Sorry, Fujimaru! Mother made a huge mistake!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Draco is a crying child! She's a child before she is a Beast!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Draco is also a sweet daughter of mine!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Mother will never abandon any of her children!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Tiamat!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Everyone's mother!  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Bawwwwwwwwwwww! Tiamat, I looooove yooooooou!   
  
**Locusta:**   
You can have my finest truffles as a sign of gratituuuuude!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Why didn't I also get the special treatment?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Mother will deal with that huge Incarnadine! So, Fujimaru...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
You go meet Draco!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Wait, meet Draco... But how?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Even if she is alive, she's inside that big monster, no?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
&mdash;I can handle it.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Leave it to me.  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Agreed. After all we've been through, no way am I letting this conclude with a bad ending!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
I'm not like Draco. I never once wanted any story wrapped with a neat bow!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
I'm only a fan of the never-ending&mdash; eternally-spanning tales of the glittering stars!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Okay... Time for Mother's full power!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wow, she looks like Tiamat's old form,  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
back in Babylonia.  
  
  
---  
  
**Tiamat:**   
Don't     worry.     Not     scary.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I     different     old     me.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Did her personality change along with her appearance?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Protect     everyone.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Aa&mdash;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&mdash;！   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
!?   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
Is this&mdash;the power of Beast II?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Quiet     down     children.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Demon Beast Incarnadines!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm taking Draco back!  
  
  
---  
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
Fujimaru. The time has finally come...   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
Join us, our Master. We are an Evil of Humanity. We are the city-devouring Beast.   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
We shall scorch all Roman cities. We shall scorch the whole Roman world.   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
Burn, Roman mankind, Roman Human Order, Roman palace, Roman throne, Roman mother, Roman poisons.   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
Burn everything carrying the Roman spirit of romance. Throw all, all, all, all to the fire&mdash;   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
We'll be with you&mdash; when the Roman sun sets&mdash;   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Tiamat:**   
Go     in!   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
&mdash;Fujimaru!!!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
By my Command Spell, I order you!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Draco...!  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I finally found...  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The person who has always been  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
watching over me and Draco.  
  
  
---  
  
？1,1000：He's&mdash;  
  
？2,2000：She's&mdash;  
  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
Oh, don't mind me. I'm not anyone important. Not even human, in fact.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not human?  
  
**???:**  
Just a lifeless individual that nonetheless fought because I didn't want to die.   
  
**???:**  
And she supported me despite this contradiction. “Everyone is a dream of the planet,” she said.   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who are you?  
  
**???:**  
Francisco Xavi&mdash;   
  
**???:**  
(Never mind... I can see in [♂ his /♀️ her] eyes that [♂ he /♀️ she] would believe me without a second thought.)   
  
**???:**  
(I guess hanging around too many Servants does that to someone.)   
  
**???:**  
Sorry, that was a joke.   
  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
To tell you the truth, I was simply guided here by a very slim bond of fate. But one I couldn't ignore.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Were you, like...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Draco's Master?  
  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
Not exactly.   
  
**???:**  
I was Saber's Maestro, but Draco isn't Saber.   
  
**???:**  
Draco is her fallen shadow. An improperly emanated dream of the Emperor of Roses.   
  
**???:**  
But that's simply not enough of a reason to abandon her.   
  
**???:**  
I feel bad about putting you on the hook like this.   
  
**???:**  
It was me who made it so you and Draco would be stuck together with a contract.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's what I imagined.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But why me?  
  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
&mdash;Draco was always watching you.   
  
**???:**  
And your Chaldea.   
  
**???:**  
Why did Sodom's Beast make her Testament World a copy of Chaldea's battle?   
  
**???:**  
This is why.   
  
**???:**  
She may be the Beast of Depravity, but she hates foulness and sloth&mdash;   
  
**???:**  
She loves small but unmistakably radiant stars of hope amidst the foulness of desire.   
  
**???:**  
The journey of one trying to reach the stars.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I need your help  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
to recover Draco.  
  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
Let me ask you just one thing.   
  
**???:**  
She is an all-consuming flame. Love that offers, expends, and burns everything.   
  
**???:**  
Being her emanation, Draco inherited this nature from her.   
  
**???:**  
Accepting her in her current form means never escaping the evils of her love.   
  
**???:**  
&mdash;You'll be the companion of an Evil of Humanity.   
  
**???:**  
Do you still want to&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's fine.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I know that already.  
  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
I guess I didn't need to ask.   
  
**???:**  
No one's faced as many Evils of Humanity as you have.   
  
**???:**  
Take good care of Draco.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's fight together.  
  
  
---  
  
**G：Draco:**   
...   
  
**G：Draco:**   
What an utterly incorrigible individual you are.   
  
**G：Draco:**   
Always sneaking your way deep into people's hearts.   
  
**G：Draco:**   
All of my shames exposed. How could you humiliate me further?   
  
**G：Draco:**   
Bah, no matter.   
  
**G：Draco:**   
You came at the perfect time, in fact. You still have one chance.   
  
**G：Draco:**   
If I am no longer their core, the Incarnadines will perish. Do it quickly, before they completely become Sodom's Beast.   
  
**G：Draco:**   
Slay me here and now.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
  
---  
  
**G：Draco:**   
Order my suicide with your Command Spell.   
  
**G：Draco:**   
I implore you, Fujimaru. Give me the ending I deserve, once and for all&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why does the Spiral Testament World  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
go all the way up to Heaven?  
  
  
---  
  
**G：Draco:**   
What are you talking about?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I believe our journey is&mdash;  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A climb to Heaven,  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
to reach for the stars of hope.  
  
  
---  
  
**G：Draco:**   
   
  
**G：Draco:**   
Reaching the hope above...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
By my Command Spell, I order you!  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Live, Draco!  
  
  
---  
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
&mdash;Why?   
  
**???:**  
Listen closely. Demon Beast Incarnadines, extensions of myself.   
  
**???:**  
I told you that after my defeat by Chaldea, I would accept my finale with honor&mdash;   
  
**???:**  
I apologize for lying to you!   
  
**???:**  
It turns out&mdash;I am irredeemably desperate to survive!   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
&mdash;WHYYYYYYYYYYY?   
  
**Setanta:**   
No way!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Beast     VI     ?   
  
**???:**  
And you... What a [♂ man /♀️ woman] you are.   
  
**???:**  
Never worn down by the exposed depths of my unsightliness, never giving up in the face of cataclysm&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
Splendidly done! A bright, burning shout, Fujimaru, my contractor!   
  
**Draco:**   
It is my duty to approve this greedy desire of yours&mdash;an atrocity of utmost beauty!   
  
**Draco:**   
Fujimaru! You are the rider mounted on the Beast!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Draco!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Right...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
You are the Princeps...aren't you?   
  
**Draco:**   
Verily! What is the matter? Praise me to your heart's content!   
  
**Draco:**   
And forgive me, Locusta! For I am merely an alternate possibility of Emperor Nero.   
  
**Draco:**   
A Beast who tried the route of cursing the world instead of accepting the setting sun. Emperor Nero's bad ending.   
  
**Draco:**   
But&mdash;through this battle, or rather, through your will and decisions, you managed to promote a shadow to a truth!   
  
**Draco:**   
This form takes the appearance of an impossible Nero who overcame the thrice-setting sun&mdash; My future self!   
  
**Draco:**   
You may call me Isekai-Incarnated Claudius&mdash; Nay, better yet, Demon Beast Emperor Draco!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I won't.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Kind of a bad idea.  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Ahahahahaha&mdash;Oh, now that's something!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
That tyrant...pulled one hell of a Deus ex Machina!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Draco...   
  
**Draco:**   
Whoa!? Who are you? Beast II?   
  
**Draco:**   
Look at how huge you've gotten... Is this supposed to be a challenge against me?!   
  
**Draco:**   
But the joke's on you! I am slightly taller!   
  
**Draco:**   
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!   
  
**F：Tiamat:**   
Welcome     daughter     (squeeze)   
  
**Draco:**   
Why the sudden hug?! But you have my permission! For I am a tolerant emperor!   
  
**Draco:**   
You are allowed to hug me tighter. Do press those voluptuous components of yours with force.   
  
**Setanta:**   
She wasn't like that before.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's more Nero...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
than Draco here.  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeps... That's the Princeps I know...!   
  
**Draco:**   
I am sorry to worry you, Locusta.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeps... I was...   
  
**Draco:**   
You needn't complete that sentence.   
  
**Draco:**   
Locusta, it is true that your poison was meant to kill me.   
  
**Draco:**   
But it was made of sheer love for me.   
  
**Draco:**   
I demanded and you provided. What could I possibly blame you for?   
  
**Draco:**   
Such fidelity you showed, Locusta.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Princeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeps!   
  
**Draco:**   
Oh, you too? You are coming to hug me? Excellent, go ahead! I will hold you!   
  
**Setanta:**   
...tch!?   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
Why, Draco?   
  
**Draco:**   
Difficult question... the best answer I can provide is, let me see.   
  
**Draco:**   
# The power of love!   
  
**Draco:**   
If nothing else.   
  
**Draco:**   
That was embarrassing...   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
We were reborn as a True Beast! The seat of Beast VI/S is ours!   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
Then why&mdash; Why is your Saint Graph&mdash;!?   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Draco's Class is...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
still Beast.  
  
  
---  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
I see... That's the answer you two chose.   
  
**Draco:**   
Yes. I have already answered you, O extensions of myself. It is due to the power of love.   
  
**Draco:**   
Evils of Humanity are Love for Humanity&mdash; therefore, I shall prove one can join mankind's journey without abandoning a Beast's evil.   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
...   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
&mdash;You are flame. All you know to do is burn.   
  
**Draco:**   
I know that.   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
&mdash;You will never reach the stars.   
  
**Draco:**   
I know that.   
  
**Draco:**   
But who has never raised their hands to the stars in the night sky?   
  
**Draco:**   
Forgive me, extensions of myself. I will not abdicate the seat of Beast VI/S to anyone.   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
We will burn the Roman world&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
Words with no substance. Speak no further and instead show your sword.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Fujimaru! This is the end of our journey.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Right...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's all fight together.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Yes&mdash;Let us seize victory as one!   
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
...It... cannot end here... ...It... cannot end like this...   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
I am not ready to die... &mdash;I do not want to die...   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
...I have done... nothing wrong...   
  
**Rebloomed Demon Beast Incarnadines:**   
How could I forgive this?&mdash;I will&mdash;burn the&mdash;world&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
Nero grieved in her last moments with the setting sun, but didn't reject it.   
  
**Draco:**   
Draco grew tired of everything and distanced herself. Therefore, you are the only ones, extensions of myself.   
  
**Draco:**   
Only you hate and curse my life.   
  
**Draco:**   
You retrieved the resolute flame Nero discarded and kept it alight with passion instead of letting it go out, sunk in mud.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;What great fidelity.   
  
**Draco:**   
But if that is what you are, why do you remain obsessed with Fujimaru even after achieving true Beasthood?   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
&mdash;Join us&mdash;our contractor&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
That was a foolish question...   
  
**Draco:**   
None can bear being left alone when the sun sets on the world.   
  
**Draco:**   
At the bottom of that lifeless place&mdash; with no one attending your deathbed.   
  
**Demonic Beast Luxuria:**   
&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
Luxuria. Ira.   
  
**Draco:**   
Invidia. Gula. Acedia.   
  
**Draco:**   
Superbia. Avaritia&mdash;   
  
**Draco:**   
Return to me. You shall live in my company.   
  
**Draco:**   
And if I too once again become a Beast feeding on the Human Order&mdash;only then will we together scorch the Roman world.   
  
**--ARROW--**  
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Look towards Heaven.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Twilight Ladder...  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Yes... The end of the journey.   
  
**Draco:**   
That Ladder leaves the Spiral Testament World, returning you to your original world.   
  
**Draco:**   
Fujimaru. We are hereby no longer shackled to each other.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ah, the old Draco is back.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
... Forget her...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Forget everything. That woman you met was not me.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How so?  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
It's just that the heat of the moment passed and now she's embarrassed about her excitement.   
  
**Draco:**   
That is it. I will kill you.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Oh, will you? I'd like to see you try!   
  
**Locusta:**   
It's no problem, Princeps! Your adult self is also absurdly beautiful!   
  
**Draco:**   
# Watch your mouth.   
  
**Locusta:**   
Eeeeeeeeeeeek!   
  
**Setanta:**   
She didn't even get this mad at the actual betrayal.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Draco, are you going through those complicated phases of puberty?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Are you feeling uncomfortable? I can hug it out if you want.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ah, she's also back to normal.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
This Beast is exponentially more annoying than she used to be!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Draco, my sweet daughter, don't be afraid of your fawning mother.   
  
**Draco:**   
Auugh, do not embrace me! I will not be any other Beast's friend!   
  
**Draco:**   
What...? What is it with this lukewarm look in your eyes, Fujimaru?   
  
**Draco:**   
It is unpleasant. Deeply distasteful. I cannot stop grinding my teeth.   
  
**Draco:**   
The Ladder awaits you... You may return to Chaldea.   
  
**Draco:**   
My contract with you was successfully broken. And I have successfully rebloomed as a True Beast.   
  
**Draco:**   
Looking only at the results, all was as planned. A perfect victory. HAHAHAHAHA!   
  
**Draco:**   
O Fujimaru...   
  
**Draco:**   
Our contract was annulled&mdash; but your fate was certainly linked to mine.   
  
**Draco:**   
One day, the City-Eater Draco will appear before you.   
  
**Draco:**   
To devour your Chaldea, which served as the original scripture for my Testament World&mdash;the supreme delicacy.   
  
**Draco:**   
Wherever your quest takes you&mdash;I promise you Draco will keep you company at your deathbed.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then, when you do,  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
can we fight together?  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
You've not listened to a single word I spoke. But I won't bother.   
  
**Draco:**   
Here, take this with you.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Holy Grail...  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
So it was with you all this time? You really know how to put people to do your dirty work.   
  
**Draco:**   
I never lied. I told you my chalice lost its form and power until it was filled with Locusta's poison.   
  
**Draco:**   
Carrying a vessel with no power and form is the same as carrying none at all, do you not agree?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Eh... It's really too late for me to care.   
  
**Draco:**   
Take this thing away from me already. Shoo. Shoo.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Fujimaru. You must conquer your own setting sun.   
  
**Locusta:**   
...Eh! I'm starting to get unsummoned!?   
  
**Locusta:**   
Screw this. I want so much more quality time with the Princeps...   
  
**Locusta:**   
There's so much we still need to talk about, but I'm about to go poof!   
  
**Locusta:**   
Eat mushrooms! My final message! Goodbye!   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Well then, it's about time for me to take my leave, too.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
You put on a good show with this journey. Once again proving that you're wonderful.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Master of Chaldea. May your journey be blessed with flowers!   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Your mother needs to go, as I much as I wish I don't.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Fujimaru, call your mother when you're in need.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Especially when the problem is another Beast. Mother will ground them.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
And then I'll stay behind to spoil you all rotten.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
What a terrifying plan, if I do say so myself.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Be well until then... Let's go, Setanta.   
  
**Setanta:**   
...Hm? Yeah, I know.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Well, bye, Master.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you, Draco!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I had fun!  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
Fujimaru... Rider of the Beast. My contractor.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Let us hear thunderous applause for your hell.   
  
**Draco:**   
&mdash;Alone, once more.   
  
**Draco:**   
My tutor, he also went somewhere far too distant... beyond my reach.   
  
**Draco:**   
I'm no longer prisoner to the setting sun, but the cosmos extends too wide around me.   
  
**Draco:**   
So, Draco, what will your next tale be about?   
  
## The Encore Never Ends  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai made...   
  
**Kadoc:**   
A contract...with a Beast...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It was real rough going!  
  
  
---  
  
**Kadoc:**   
...   
  
**Kadoc:**   
Sorry, this is making me lightheaded... I need to lie down for a bit...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Take care!  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai made...   
  
**Gordolf:**   
A contract with a Beast, you saaay!?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yup.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It was rough.  
  
  
---  
  
**Gordolf:**   
Could it be...perhaps...that Beast came with you...?   
  
**Gordolf:**   
...   
  
**Gordolf:**   
&mdash;That's it. Apologies, but I'm heading out now. I have some videos I still need to watch before I die.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's our commander, strong of heart.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Anxious about the future, I guess...?  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I thought it was a lovely story, at least...   
  
**Mash:**   
Draco, Tiamat, Locusta, and Setanta...   
  
**Mash:**   
If it happens that they have some connection to Chaldea, I would love to meet them all myself!   
  
**H：Setanta:**   
I wouldn't. I've been through enough Beast business for one lifetime.   
  
**G：Mash:**   
Huh...?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Setantaaaa!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How did you get here!?  
  
  
---  
  
**Setanta:**   
What? I just clung on to the Ladder.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Well, it was a shot in the dark. I really just wanted to travel some more with you.   
  
**Setanta:**   
Huh... So this is what the Chaldea here is like?   
  
**Setanta:**   
It's pretty different from the one we got back home.   
  
**Mash:**   
Could this person be Setanta? He definitely resembles Cú Chulainn...   
  
**Setanta:**   
What's up, Mash? I'll be crashing with you guys for a while.   
  
**Mash:**   
Y-yes... Happy to have you...   
  
**H：Setanta:**   
As for you, Master, I'll be your Servant for as long as I'm here.   
  
**H：Setanta:**   
Don't hesitate to call on me, just like before! &mdash;The pleasure will be all mine!   
  
**J：???:**  
Oh, so you are the Servant said to have come from a distant Chaldea?   
  
**Mash:**   
Emperor Nero!   
  
**Setanta:**   
Ah, you don't seem to be Draco. The you here now seems no different from the one we got back there.   
  
**Setanta:**   
&mdash;I'm Setanta. Looking forward to being part of the team.   
  
**Nero:**   
Verily! I get it! There's a guise of me in that other Chaldea as well!   
  
**Nero:**   
Well, it's no surprise. I'm just that popular, after all. Wahaha!   
  
**Nero:**   
Not to mention... I heard talk of you travelling with a me different from myself, too&mdash;this Draco.   
  
**Nero:**   
I was told she was no more than a little girl. She must have been the sweetest thing!   
  
**Setanta:**   
...   
  
**Nero:**   
Hm, what's the matter? If you wish to sing my praises, then speak freely!   
  
**Setanta:**   
It's not that... That Draco probably just wasn't the nice kid you picture, I guess.   
  
**Setanta:**   
After all, she was&mdash;   
  
**Nero:**   
&mdash;A Beast. Most certainly. It's no wonder, really.   
  
**Nero:**   
My love is a flame of passion! If I really wished for it, I could set the whole world ablaze once or twice over!   
  
**Nero:**   
Hehe... I'm quite the naughty emperor, aren't I?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Uh...that's... I guess?   
  
**Mash:**   
Ahahaha...   
  
**Nero:**   
But that's why... This Draco, if she was a dream born of love...   
  
**Nero:**   
&mdash;Then I wish to know. What passion burned within that other me? Towards what star did she extend her reach?   
  
**Setanta:**   
...   
  
**Nero:**   
Fujimaru. I wish to hear it.   
  
**Nero:**   
The story of you and Draco, ascending towards the cosmos.   
  
**Mash:**   
Yes... Yes, Senpai! I would like to hear it too!   
  
**Mash:**   
Your new journey through the Singularities&mdash;   
  
**Mash:**   
How similar and different they were from ours and what we experienced.   
  
**Setanta:**   
No choice, huh...   
  
**Setanta:**   
Well, I'll just have to spill the beans on all the crap Locusta pulled.   
  
**Nero:**   
Ah, Locusta! What about her? Was she doing well?   
  
**Setanta:**   
She was certainly lively...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, you could say that...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll tell you all about it.  
  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A story of our ascending towards the cosmos. How...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
the echoes of a dream went beyond the sunset  
  
  
---  
  
## 	Capital of Gluttony  
  
**Mordred?:**  
Yeah... There's an end to everything.   
  
**Mordred?:**  
That majestic castle, shining proudly, will collapse. Those armored knights bearing arms will die all the same too.   
  
**Mordred?:**  
Even the world will end someday. But not at the hands of scum like you. Not at all.   
  
**Mordred?:**  
The end of the world ain't a lousy spectacle like this without a soul to attend to it.   
  
**Mordred?:**  
On the contrary, it's the end for you bastards. You've already had your fill, haven't you?   
  
**Mordred?:**  
Then it's the end for you. I'll put you out of your misery!   
  
**Draco:**   
We think quite alike, Knight of Treachery.   
  
**Draco:**   
An end with no one present at its deathbed...   
  
**Draco:**   
Indeed, nothing could be sadder. Nothing could hurt more.   
  
**Draco:**   
I am the evil born in response to such fear.   
  
**Draco:**   
I feed on cities at the peak of prosperity, the upper bounds of civilization, therefore I can stand beside the ending world's deathbed!   
  
**Draco:**   
Tch...! Quite the troublesome figure has appeared!   
  
**Artoria?:**  
I am but another what-if of myself, from beneath a different sky.   
  
**Artoria?:**  
One that springs from holding the Holy Lance, on the verge of apotheosis,   
  
**Artoria?:**  
yet clinging to the slimmest of chances of remaining myself.   
  
**Artoria?:**  
The possibility of retaining my identity while wielding the power of the Lance. The possibility of accepting the curse of the Grail.   
  
**Artoria?:**  
A version of myself unable to act as a king, as my nature is that of the storm.   
  
**Artoria?:**  
That...is what I am.   
  
**Artoria?:**  
Nothing more than a storm&mdash;which ravages that which lies before me.   
  
**Mordred?:**  
I have heard your words! Father&ndash;no, Storm King, leader of the Wild Hunt!   
  
**Artoria?:**  
&mdash;Holy Lance, removing restraints.   
  
## Capital of Envy  
  
**Nightingale?:**  
Pathogenic bacterium again...?   
  
**Nightingale?:**  
Their extermination is truly quite an ordeal. There is no other way but to change the world.   
  
**Scáthach?:**  
Oh, don't say that. If we're overcome here, then there is no hope for the Human Order.   
  
**D：???:**  
Wait.   
  
**Cú Chulainn Alter?:**  
This is my prey, Master.   
  
**Scáthach?:**  
Even you showed up...I have to say, even I didn't expect this.   
  
**Scáthach?:**  
A miracle may be occurring, but how dare you stir from your throne?   
  
**Cú Chulainn Alter?:**  
It's only natural that after a defeat, the loser goes over to the winner's side.   
  
**Cú Chulainn Alter?:**  
Forcing your own way through without letting others do the same is just hypocrisy.   
  
**Draco:**   
...   
  
**Cú Chulainn Alter?:**  
Even if it's through mutual hate or simply killing each other, bonds once made can't be broken.   
  
**Cú Chulainn Alter?:**  
At the very least I can do what I'm supposed to&mdash;That's all.   
  
**Cú Chulainn Alter?:**  
I told you already, that Beast is my prey.   
  
**Scáthach?:**  
Now, on to the extended final battle of the second American Civil War! I wish all you great heroes here good hunting!   
  
**Arjuna?:**  
Very well. I'll ward off my feelings of hatred and envy by surpassing your battlefield score, at least for now.   
  
**Arjuna?:**  
Now, ready your spear!   
  
**Karna?:**  
Of course. And you nock your arrows, Arjuna.   
  
**Cú Chulainn Alter?:**  
&mdash;I'll kill you!   
  
## Capital of Wrath  
  
**Medjed?:**  
Pay close attention! And now, behold!   
  
**Medjed?:**  
For this is the advent of splendor! The splendor of Pharaoh Ozymandias!   
  
**Ozymandias?:**  
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Your supreme Pharaoh just happened to be passing by!   
  
**Ozymandias?:**  
And by complete coincidence, also passing by in the form of Amon-Ra!   
  
**Ozymandias?:**  
On a pleasure cruise, that is!   
  
**Draco:**   
Ozymandias... It was due to him that I was unable to mimic Amon with a Demon Beast Incarnadine.   
  
**Draco:**   
Thinking back, that was when the project first left its rails... No, now it is too late for this kind of conjecture.   
  
**Cursed Arm?:**  
We are present too! Unfit as we may be, we would like to offer our assistance...!   
  
**Medusa?:**  
I'm here too. Not yet, Izou. Not quite yet.   
  
**Okada Izou?:**  
Rider, you think I'm a dog or something after all, is that it...?   
  
**Georgius?:**  
I am present as well! I have come forth to rectify my sins from that Singularity!   
  
**Georgius?:**  
The Great Bewitching Queen who cants the Great Grail, in other words, the great evil spoken of in the Book of Revelation!   
  
**Georgius?:**  
In which case, thou art a dragon! I swear upon my Ascalon!   
  
**Georgius?:**  
I shall decapitate&mdash;one of those heads of yours!   
  
## Concealed Passageway Under the Holy Tomb  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
Zzz...   
  
**Setanta:**   
She calmed down...   
  
**Georgios:**   
What was she? What was she doing here?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We saved this Singularity from a major crisis.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm glad we solved this before more of them appeared.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
More of them...?   
  
**Setanta:**   
Two of the same person being summoned is a common occurence in Chaldea. Think of that other version of me pretending to be a druid.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Her case is not exactly that.  
  
  
---  
  
**Draco:**   
What are you talking about?   
  
**Draco:**   
She is just an anti-hero. I cannot fathom what terrifies you so much.   
  
**Draco:**   
Well, I must admit her sound blasts were formidable. A lovely yet powerful attack that makes the spine crawl.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm just glad no one's hurt...  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Peace until next Halloween...  
  
  
---  
  
**Locusta:**   
Dear Master, I believe I understand what you mean. (Whispering)   
  
**Locusta:**   
The little lady had the same vibes as the Princeps that one day she recital'd to an audience she locked up in the theater. (Trembling)   
  
**Georgios:**   
This way, people. We can enter the castle through this passage.   
  
**Georgios:**   
I believe the Outer God summoning ritual has already begun. We must hurry!   
  
## The Bottom of the Oblivion is Still Unknown  
  
**Tiamat:**   
Hmph, easy as pie.   
  
**???:**  
Why...   
  
**E：Sita:**   
Why did you save me?   
  
**E：Sita:**   
We tried to defeat your dear contractor along with Beast VI.   
  
**E：Sita:**   
Although we may be fellow enemies of Beast VI, that would go against your wishes.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I'm everyone's mother. No child gets left behind.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
But don't worry, daughter. I'll succeed where you failed to defeat her.   
  
**Sita:**   
Don't bother with me. This attack destroyed my hideout.   
  
**Sita:**   
There is nothing more I can do. Besides, the current assailants were...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Not Servants summoned to this Singularity... am I wrong?   
  
**Sita:**   
You're right... Someone else is meddling here.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I can tell. Whoever chose this lineup did so with the intent to pester me.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Those children are after me. You'll be safe if you stay away.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
I'm sorry.   
  
**Sita:**   
Don't be. Besides, I...   
  
**Sita:**   
I always felt this whole Spiral Testament World is not what we assumed it to be.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Georgios said the same thing.   
  
**Sita:**   
We were summoned to this world to slay Sodom's Beast.   
  
**Sita:**   
There is no doubt about that. But for what reason?   
  
**Sita:**   
Because the enemy is a Beast&mdash;is that really all there is to it?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
What do you mean?   
  
**Sita:**   
Is this really a threat to the Human Order?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
A Beast is an avatar of destruction created by humanity.   
  
**Tiamat:**   
This fact is immutable&mdash;   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
You know, Tiamat...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
...?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
I'm thinking about something really convoluted, but maybe you actually have the right idea.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Believe it or not, maybe killing Draco will in fact solve all our problems.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
And with that established... What are you going to do?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
A mother can do anything to protect her children...   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Great goddess Tiamat, former Beast, I have but one question for you:   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
After renouncing your position of Beasthood, how will you walk alongside mankind?   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
&mdash;What will your tale be about?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
Mine?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
...   
  
**Sita:**   
Goddess Tiamat?   
  
**Tiamat:**   
...   
  
**Tiamat:**   
The Ladder flew off. After them.   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
Yeah, right... Hurrying up would be a good idea.   
  
**H：Lady Avalon:**   
This world is a spiral coaster to the cosmos, but the higher we go, the deeper we get.   
  
**H：Lady Avalon:**   
The more we rise to the depths, the more they'll be bombarded with the blunt truth&mdash;   
  
**Lady Avalon:**   
&mdash;Travellers soaring along this spiral, why do you seek the stars above you?
