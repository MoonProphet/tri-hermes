# Prisma Codes  
  
## Prelude  
   
**???:**  
Hey, we can be friends forever and ever and ever and ever, right? Right?  
  
   
**???:**  
...Idiot. Are you stupid?  
  
   
**???:**  
You screamed, “I'm done with you!” at me yesterday. Did you already forget?  
  
   
**???:**  
Um, I forgot. Besides, it's okay!  
  
   
**???:**  
Magic. We have magic!  
We are magical girls after all!  
  
   
**???:**  
Magical...girl? You call yourself that?  
What's that? Don't you mean a witch?  
  
   
**???:**  
Don't you think it's embarrassing to admit your own immaturity? That's just a failure. Besides...  
  
   
**???:**  
I-I don't have any talent for magic...  
I can read some spell tomes, but that's about it...  
  
   
**???:**  
Hey, what are you talking about? That's plenty talented! I can never do what you do! I get stuck right away!  
  
   
**???:**  
Don't write yourself off so quickly! You're such an idiot... Don't give up before you even start...  
  
   
**???:**  
If you want to use magic properly, you should start by studying runes&mdash;  
  
   
**???:**  
Study...? Oh, sorry, sorry. I'll try my best.  
  
   
**???:**  
What am I to do with you...  
  
   
**???:**  
Senpai. Senpai.  
Get a hold of yourself.  
  
   
**???:**  
This is not the time to be sleeping. If you don't get up...  
I will (censored) you. Is that okay with you?  
  
   
**???:**  
To do that, I must muster up all the courage in my body and put everything I have into it. There's no other way.  
  
   
**???:**  
Is that really okay?  
I'm really going to (censored) you.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's scary. I should get up.  
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning. A wonderful awakening, that's the Senpai I know.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
From the way you sleep to the way you rise up like a submarine making an emergency ascent...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You have grown so much. I can't slack off anymore.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I guess I have to ask Kiyohime to teach me the Hot Fire Wake Up Time technique next time.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Zzz... (Show me what you've got.)  
   
**???:**  
Hm? You're actually awake, aren't you, Senpai?  
  
   
**???:**  
When you sleep, your ears move back and forth like when Fou is dreaming, so I can tell.  
  
   
**???:**  
...Senpai?  
  
   
**???:**  
That was just a little joke. There is no point training your facial muscles now.  
  
   
**???:**  
In some way, I respect you for putting efforts in such trivial matters... But right now I need you to focus that effort somewhere else.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...There you go. Finally.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
It seems like another unexpected Rayshift.  
Although it seems like just... the two of us.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I've never seen such a place before.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wow... Sure is an unusual sight.  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. We've visited many different eras in world history, but this time I can't even tell if it's Earth or not...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is like a different world. I feel uneasy.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's take a look around.  
   
**Mash:**   
I agree. Let's explore with caution.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Never mind the Servants.  
I'm concerned if Fou might have been involved.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's contact Chaldea.  
   
**Mash:**   
I already tried... But I am not getting any response...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Do they realize that we've disappeared from Chaldea? Even so...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**B：???:**  
Aaaaah!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, I hear something over there. Could it be Fou?  
...No, it sounded more cheerful...  
  
   
**B：???:**  
Aaaaah! Move out of the way!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, watch out!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ouch!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash!? Are you okay?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm fine... (Sniff, sniff)  
I'm a Shielder, after all... (Sniff)  
  
   
**B：???:**  
Oh my, I can't believe we bumped into each other head-on like that! I am very sorry!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A talking... stick?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**B：???:**  
Oh my! I sense powerful magical energy from you.  
Are you outsiders as well?  
  
   
**B：???:**  
Well, well! Lucky me! In that case, can I ask you for a tiny favor?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um, is something wrong?  
   
**B：???:**  
Yes! There is!  
  
   
**B：???:**  
I'm being chased by a very scary person!  
We were fighting and I got blown sky-high!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fighting!? This place seems so peaceful, yet there are enemies here? ...And who exactly are you, anyway?  
  
   
**???:**  
Ooooh, you want to know, hmm?  
Are you infatuated by my devilish charm?  
  
   
**???:**  
Then I shall tell you! Get a load of this: I'm...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Um, so what the heck are you?  
   
**???:**  
Well, well, well! Intrigued, are you?  
You wanna know, do you?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It seems so happy...  
  
   
**???:**  
Well, then, let me introduce myself!  
I am the alluring synthonatural spirit...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ruby:**   
The Magical Stick of Love and Justice, Magical Ruby! YES, IT'S ME!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Oh, I'm so sorry about bumping into your face earlier. (Bowing)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, it's fine...  
  
   
...Wait!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Oh my, it's just the stick.  
You're still alive?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
You're very tough. I guess you weren't kidding about being a gem-type Mystic Code.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A sudden barrage of attacking spells!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...And they're airborne!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Pink hair... It's her! The one who sent both my Master and me flying!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Warning! WARNING!  
  
   
## 1ins: A Strange, Strange Land of Sweets I  
   
**C：???:**  
Wow, another new guest? But...this Master and its familiar seem pretty boring.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Are you talking about...us?  
Am I the familiar?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you a Servant?  
   
**C：???:**  
A Servant? Me? Ha ha, what are you talking about!?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
How humorous and pathetic. That's so cute.  
You are worth teasing♡  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Wound up here, oblivious to everything, like a pitiful bunch of lost rabbits. That's it, isn't it?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you...Queen Medb?  
   
**C：???:**  
Oh, you know who I am? That makes me a little happy. But you're a little off the mark.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's true... Something feels off about her.  
That tiara seems more sparkly than usual...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**C：???:**  
Fine, I shall tell you the name of the queen who will be ruling you from today.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
I'll say it only once, so listen carefully. If I have to repeat myself, I'll feed you to my guard dog♡  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Men's hopes of servitude and dreams of enslavement are my energy source! I'm the greatest magical girl of all!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
I am the Magical Girl of Honey and Geis, Connacht☆Medb! Oh, you don't need to be so formal with me!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Magical Girl Medb!  
   
**Medb:**   
That's right! Awww... You're the first one to ever actually do it!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Not bad... Not bad at all! I'm so embarrassed I could die! What an irresistible feeling!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Magical College Student Medb!?  
   
**Medb:**   
Girl! Magical Girl! Why are you being so specific?  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Sure, I know I barely qualify as a girl anymore.  
But just go along with it, okay!?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medb:**   
ANYWAY! My chariot brought me here with a spectacular entrance as ever.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Nowadays I'm the queen who rules the Land of Snow and Honey. That's me. Got it?  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Now, hand me that magical stick&ndash; “Ruby” or whatever it was&ndash;right this minute!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Nooooo! There is only one Master to whom I have sworn my heart!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
I will never be yours!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh no! Summoned enemy entities are heading this way! Master!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh, Ruby? Is this magical girl bad?  
   
**Ruby:**   
Umm, it's hard for me to judge those things.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
But her “it's my land, so anything goes” attitude really makes me mad!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
If you were my Master, I wouldn't allow it!  
You'd get a punishment BIG TIME!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What kind of person is your Master, Ruby?  
   
**Ruby:**   
Whoa, is it confession time already?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
...She's a very normal girl!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
But she can be crazy strong sometimes!  
Oh, and she's compassionate! And hardworking!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
...I suppose like any other girl she gets swayed easily once her desire switch kicks in, but still...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Kind of scary, huh, how even the brightest among us can become rampaging monsters... Wouldn't you agree?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai? Why are you staring at me? Are you trying to make eye contact?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway, let's prepare for battle!  
Focus on the monster in front of us for now!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Roger. Let's give them a hand!  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Oh, are you pigs challenging me?  
Fine, I'll make you squeal.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Go, Reindeer Man! Snowman! Let's show them the Land of Snow and Honey's power!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Medb:**   
Oh, we lost? Really.  
You guys are pretty strong.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
In this neutral zone, it seems my soldiers can't fight at 100%. Lesson learned.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
But the games have just begun, piggies.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
I am Queen Medb. I can create as many soldiers as I want.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I won't let you summon any more enemies!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, Mash! Wait!  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
My. Was that an attack? It was so weak, I couldn't tell.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Hehe. I know you want to touch me, but hold off on those measly hits, okay?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Arg!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's not over yet! I can...do more! Haah!!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash's attacks aren't working at all!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Medb:**   
I told you it's useless. It looks like you don't understand the rules yet.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
But this is nice, very nice. I like that desperate expression, the aura of an underdog!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
I thought you might be a good snack for Mini Cú, but perhaps I should eat you instead?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
My attacks are all being blocked?  
How is this possible!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash, let's retreat! Something's off!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
But... if we retreat now, we'll be captured by Queen Medb!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Something tells me that won't turn out well, so...  
I won't... give up so easily!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
...Hm?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
That's right! Don't give up!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
(Panting) I ran too much. Jeez, Ruby!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Now what!? Who's this!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Ruby:**   
Yes, my Master! Ruby is right here!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Sorry for all the trouble! I'm zipping right on over!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Hmm...  
  
   
**Medb:**   
She's not broken despite getting run over by my chariot. This new Magical Girl is quite feisty!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
You, tell me your name! I may invite you into my invincible army!  
  
   
**???:**  
Ugh, spouting nonsense again...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
My... My name is Illyasviel von Einzbern!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I don't care about your invincible army!  
Just give me back Miyu!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Miyu is my... my very best friend!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ruby! Transform!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Certainly!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Compact, Full Open!  
Gateway to Mirror World, Revealed!!☆  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
 Die Spiegelform wird fertig zum!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
 Öffnunug des Kaleidoskopsgatter!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya has arrived!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Sorry, ignore my previous invitation. What is with that transformation? It's getting on my nerves.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
We don't need more of you here.  
You're an eyesore, so I'll kill you for real.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I wasn't ready before, that's all!  
This time you won't have it so easy!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Schneiden!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
You little brat...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wow... It's working! Her attacks are getting through to Medb, Master!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Her movement has slowed down!  
Now's your chance!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Yup, leave it to me!  
Maximum convergence...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Feuer!!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
You're such a brat, I tell you!  
Don't you dare get carried awa&mdash;  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Mini Cú!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
He took the blow for her!?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
I'm guessing you must be her familiar?  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Hey, Medb. You're getting carried away in someone else's kingdom.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
If you're gonna go crazy on other people's turf, make sure you're prepared. Your magical barrier is full of holes already, idiot.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
It's good you want to crush them. They're your enemies. However, only an idiot would drag on a fight on someone else's turf.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
If you're gonna do it, do it quick. If you fail, return right away. That's basic stuff. Basic.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Mini Cú...!  
That advice is so flawless!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
But this is different!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Don't you think this the perfect opportunity to show everyone how a magical girl's familiar should act? By sacrificing yourself in the most honorable way?  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Shut up, don't make me throw codfish and cheese snacks at you. C'mon, we're leaving.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Oh Mini Cú, kill me! I love you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Queen Medb and her mysterious familiar have withdrawn. A very bold retreat...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Miyu... I need to save Miyu!  
...What!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
The transformation wore off!? What are you doing, Ruby!? I can't go after that person like this!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Huh? For some reason the magical energy feed isn't stabilizing...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
The reception seems strangely poor... Hmm...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Well, if you just walk around, maybe you'll get a bar soon.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Like a cell phone!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'm Illyasviel von Einzbern. I am a 5th year student at Homurahara Academy Elementary School.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
A-And, uh, I'm... I'm a... I've been forced into the role of a... a m-magical girl...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ahhh! This is really embarrassing when you say it aloud!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Um, thank you so much for finding and protecting Ruby! (Bowing)  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Um, Ms. Kyrielight?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please call me Mash, Miss Einzbern.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh, me too then! Call me Illya!  
All my friends call me that!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
And, um, who is this (mumble) cool (mumble) person next to you?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Call me your [♂ big brother /♀ big sister] Fujimaru.  
   
**Illya:**   
Well, that's a little too, er... I'd still be hesitant to do that...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
She says that because Illya has an all-purpose husbando big brother who she absolutely adores.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Although, having another person to silently adore when they aren't paying attention wouldn't be so bad. Pretty naughty if you ask me...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
What are you saying, Ruby!?  
No, um, that's not the point!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Um, would it be okay to just call you Fujimaru?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A real magical girl!? I am crying!  
   
**Illya:**   
Crying!? What are you crying for??  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Your Magical Girl Power has notably increased lately. Maybe it's time to pass out meet and greet tickets?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I didn't know Senpai was that knowledgeable in a specific field of magecraft...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please give me a lesson on it soon, if that's&mdash;Hmm?  
I need to first binge-watch the entire box set? ...What's a box set?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
U-Um... Then is it okay for me to just call you...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Fujimaru?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
A-And! Um...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I know this is strange to say, but... the aura Mash gives off is kind of similar to my own family's...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
It's a bit of a relief, considering I don't even know where I am now.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is that... so? I'm glad to hear it.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Ho ho! If by “similar” you mean in terms of their curvaceous figures, then yes, there is one particular failed maid back at the house, isn't there!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That's not what I'm talking about!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Haha...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So let me get your story straight, Illya...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
While trying to get from your own world to the neighboring “Mirror World,” you and the others ran into some trouble, the cause of which is unknown.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
After getting caught up in the mix, you and this “Miyu Edelfelt,” another magical girl, wound up here, in this different dimension.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Immediately afterward, Miyu was kidnapped by a magical creature,  
  
   
**Mash:**   
and that's when Queen Medb appeared proclaiming herself as a magical girl, and attacked without question... is that correct?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Yes. We've just arrived, and we know nothing about this strange world.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We're in the same boat, since we just came from Chaldea too. Still, one thing's for sure...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They came here from a parallel world that's different than our Earth.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh! By the way, I may not look it, but I'm Japanese.  
You have a Japan where you're from, right?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Fujimaru, Mash, what's your Earth like?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll... We'll tell you some other time.  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh, that's right. I need to hurry and go save Miyu!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But please! I'd like to hear about it!  
About that Chaldea place!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ruby:**   
Earlier when we slammed into each other, I took the liberty of analyzing you. Force of habit, see.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Mash, you have a very rare class of Heroic Spirit installed, don't you?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Y-Yes. It's Shielder. But I'm not really sure what you mean by “installed,” I'm a...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Yes, that! That's it! I just noticed a moment ago!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I can't install the class card, Ruby! What should I do?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Then Miyu can't either... Oh, I'm sorry.  
Mash was in the middle of saying something.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, it's all right. But a spell to let a Heroic Spirit temporarily into your body is very unusual.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There are cases as Pseudo-Servants, but they are an exception only used during the Grand Order...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Maybe you yourself are special, Illya.  
If Miyu uses the same kind of magecraft...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There may be a connection to why Miyu was captured.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wouldn't that be a possibility, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hmm...  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Isn't a Demi-Servant similar to a magical girl?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Right... Wait, what!? Me?  
A magical girl...?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Very perceptive, my friend! I can smell magical girl talents just pouring out of Mash!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
That means I must've sought help from an unknown magical girl when I was blown away☆  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
I guess that's my instinct as a magical stick?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'll never forget how you ditched me in the middle of that fight, you know...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Magical...girl...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru! Mash! I've finally got hold of you two! Are you okay!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Whoa, whoa! A hologram?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor! Yes, we're fine!  
There's no need to be afraid, Illya.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is Doctor Roman, chief of medical at Chaldea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He's a trustworthy ally who provides support during our missions.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh? Oooohh? I think I sense an incredibly cute and pure magical energy response nearby...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru, glance to the right.  
Do you see a wonderful Servant in front of you?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh, um...? Are you perhaps talking about me?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor. Illya will get a really bad impression of you, so please restrain yourself.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yup, that's what I thought.  
Don't worry, I'll act like a good, responsible adult!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So, putting that aside, I have news for you.  
Please don't be alarmed, but you're&mdash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You're all inside someone's Reality Marble!  
  
   
## 1ins: A Strange, Strange Land of Sweets II  
   
**C：???:**  
Miyu...Miyu!  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Ung...uhhh...  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Miyu!  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Sapphire? Is that...you?  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Yes, Miyu! It's me, Sapphire!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Oh, look at you... How heartbreaking...  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Sapphire... I'm so glad... You're safe...  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Yes. I'm sorry I'm so late...  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Just wait! I shall use my blade mode to free you from these restraints!  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
No... Don't touch them...  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
These restraints may look like tiny ribbons of lace...  
But they're draining away all my power...  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
I'm sure it would... swallow you up too...  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
No, Miyu! But then...!  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Go find Illya. Please, tell her...  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
...how dangerous this castle is...how terrifying our foe is...  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Miyu... Understood!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
I, Sapphire, promise to come back for you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
... (Gulp)  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I have news for you. Please don't be alarmed, but you're&mdash;You're all inside someone's Reality Marble!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Huh.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Oh my.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Umm...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's a Reality Marble again?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, I've gotta explain it from there?  
Right, I guess I do.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A Reality Marble is one of the deepest secrets of magecraft.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Basically, it's magecraft that manifests the interior world of the caster, and paints over reality with what's inside their heart.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's one of the most forbidden of all techniques and just a step below True Magic. Like Unlimited Blade something-or-other.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But of course, under normal circumstances, something that crazy could never last.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A Reality Marble is a stain on reality. The world itself detects that foreign body, that inconsistency, and moves to fix it.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So unfortunately, a Reality Marble usually only lasts a few minutes.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Did that make sense to you, Fujimaru?  
And you, cute little lady?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Umm... so basically, this entire world is just someone's creation?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yup. I've never heard of a Reality Marble of this size, though.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...I-I see...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
When I jumped to this world, for an instant I saw what looked like many castles and kingdoms...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
They were all very clearly visible, and very large.  
And there was an area surrounded by a black wall...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
And all of that was a single spell...  
A world that someone made...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yup yup. It's so satisfying to see the surprised look on your face.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru seems to have gotten used to things lately, mostly just reacting with “Eh, it'll work out” and the like.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
By the way... (Grin)  
I haven't introduced myself yet, have I? (Big grin)  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I am Romani Archaman.  
Call me Dr. Roman.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Cute little lady, what's your name? Who represents you? And what are your hobbies?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You have a Spirit Origin like a Servant, but you're quite clearly human.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You're not a Demi-Servant or a Pseudo-Servant.  
And this powerful magical energy...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Could you be the owner of the Reality Marble?  
And would you finally tell me your name?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
N-No! I-I'm just a magical girl!  
Th-Though I don't know if that's much better!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Also, sorry for not introducing myself!  
I'm Illyasviel von Einzbern.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Thank you for the polite introduction!  
Sorry for rushing you!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But... Einzbern... Einzbern, huh...?  
I guess that got shot down before it even started...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Hmm? Dr. Roman, do you know the Einzbern fam&ndash;  
I mean, do you know my mom?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, I've just seen that name before.  
But looking at you, I assume you're a different person.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Doctor, can you get us back to Chaldea?  
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. If Mash is with you, it should be fine.  
You'll be able to come back.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I hope you do ASAP. Who knows what effects that space will have on you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Can you let Illya take refuge in Chaldea too?  
Just temporarily?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm... Sorry, but that's impossible. Given the way the Rayshift works, it just can't happen.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Only Fujimaru and Mash can come back.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We might be able to if she were one of Fujimaru's contracted Servants...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And, hypothetically, even if it were possible...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That would go against our goal of guarding humanity. This is why we've spent so much effort trying not to intervene in other eras.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, Doctor. Listen. She's from a parallel world, different than our own.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And if this is all inside a Reality Marble, there should be no danger of us interfering.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Can't you ask Da Vinci for help and just&mdash;  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Mash, Mash. Um... I'm fine.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Thank you. (Bowing)But it's okay.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I have to save Miyu. I can't go escape someplace safe on my own.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
So I'll do my best, even if I'm all by myself.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Illya...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Kyuuuu...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Awah!? What's this fluffy thing?  
It's sooooo cute! I want to pet it! I HAVE TO PET IT.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...Eep! I-I'm really fine!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru. You understand, right?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This might be a good chance to power up Mash.  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah, so indeed you do. Good... What?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
MG cuteness is greater than Earth's mass?  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru! I didn't know you had the same tastes as me!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, no. No. All the staff are looking at me with cold eyes. Please stop, guys...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No! I came to Chaldea to practice my Zen Buddhism!  
I don't know anything about otaku culture!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I like it! I think it's fine!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, Da Vinci!? You can't just&ndash;  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I've been listening to your conversation.  
I'll give you all the help I can offer.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
From the values I'm seeing, Mash isn't currently able to use her full power.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I think it's because the Reality Marble is deciding that she doesn't fully meet its conditions.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That world has its own rules, and its own unique Mystic Codes.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
A lot of good could come from adapting to it, learning from it, and putting all that into practice.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It should be a good experience, both for Mash, and for Chaldea.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Aside from rescuing this captured magical girl or whatever.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Man, you're cold... Oooohh, fine!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We'll continue to monitor that world and the Rayshifts.  
If it's just you two, you should be able to go back and forth. I promise that.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So come back to Chaldea temporarily so we can regroup. That's an order.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you, Doctor.  
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
... (Sigh)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, I'm staying here.  
Someone has to protect Illya.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Even if it's difficult for me to fight magical girls, I can still fight magical creatures!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So just come back here later, please.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Got it. I'll be back as soon as possible.  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Master! Thank you!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I thought you'd say that.  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-Thank you...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I guess you knew exactly what I was thinking...  
Oh, d-don't laugh at me!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor! The summoning circle's ready!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay! Leyline connection confirmed.  
You can Rayshift anytime.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Fujimaru, Mash, thank you!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I wasn't lying when I said I'd even do my best on my own.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But this makes me very happy!  
This is reassuring!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll be back soon. You two take care.  
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Welcome back, Fujimaru. Once all your gear's ready, you're going to head back out again.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As the guy in charge, I'd prefer you took a break first... But I guess that's not an option.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
At least pack some snacks for Mash and Illya.  
Something they'd enjoy eating.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did you find the cause of our Rayshift?  
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I have of course been investigating, but... well...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...To tell the truth, it may have been best that you came back alone, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry. It's just that... Here. There's something I want to show you.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is the video of you two just before you disappeared from Chaldea.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It starts with you taking a nap here in the Command Room.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And then Mash comes by, spots you, and tries to wake you up.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
“Senpai? Oh my. You're sleeping in a place like this again?”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
“Sheba, Trismegistus, and the rest of the observation equipment will get upset.”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
“Senpai...”  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is Mash...? What is this...?  
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...We can interpret this later.  
I'll let you judge how to deal with Mash.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Da Vinci seems to have noticed something, but when I ask her she just laughs and says, “It's still a secret♪”  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And there's also the matter of Illyasviel.  
I will remind you...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That above all else, you're a member of Chaldea, and the one Master who can bring about the preservation of humanity.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We'll be ready to take you back any time.  
Just don't forget about Chaldea's mission.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Be cautious in your judgments. And at times, be cold. Understand, Master Fujimaru?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Hey, where's Da Vinci?  
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In her lab.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
She said she had something to give you, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Swing by before you go.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I heard it! I heard it all, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
You've been invited to a tropical☆wonderland of magical girls!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I'm going too! I want to go! Gwahahaha!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
What is a magical girl? It's what all girls want to be!  
It's like what you see on TV!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Excitement and thrills? Sparkles!☆ Happiness!♪ Transformations! Partial nudity! Skintight leotards! Corruption! Doujinshi...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Magical girls... Magical girls are...  
To a gentleman, they're the stuff dreams are made of!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
By the way, I'm a big fan of tanned skin, you know?  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Indeed! I shall sing a song to you.  
An exotic Arabian number!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm in a hurry, guys.  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
So am I! I can't contain myself!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Was there a guy like this in Chaldea!?  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Hah! Salty! Fujimaru is being salty! And it feels so good!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Lah-lah-lah! Oh, the cruel shadows of the stage awaken the spirits from the depths of the earth!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll think about it.  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
3, 2, 1, time's up! It's settled! When are you taking Teach? When, I say!?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Why are you sighing like that?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You'll corrupt the magical girls. So, no.  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
WHY!? WHY!? WWHHHYYYY!!?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I'm begging you, as a comrade! What happened to our alliance!?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Grrr... So you insist on not taking us?  
FINE! I'll just&mdash;  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I'll tell on you! I'll go air my complaints out to the bride emperor and the drunk loli! Their magical voices will soothe this soul, I swear!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
No... No, Captain Black, that won't do... Surely you should tell the Master's true beloved, Kiyohime?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Oh, no. That would be bad news. I'm not THAT evil.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Wait! We let 'em escape!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, that was a waste of time...  
  
  
---  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hmm?  
  
  
---  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? Where's Mash? Where's Illya!?  
  
  
---  
   
**B：???:**  
Fujimaru!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that Ruby?  
  
  
---  
   
**Ruby:**   
Fujimaru! Trouble! This way!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What happened?  
  
  
---  
   
**Ruby:**   
It's Illya and Mash!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
They were abducted by people calling themselves the residents of the Land of Sweets!

No, um... We can't...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Hey, is there a Miyu here?  
Did anyone see a black-haired girl?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Would you listen to me? Please!

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash! Illya! Are you okay!?

Senpai! I'm sorry!

We tried to ask people we ran into for information about this area...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And before we knew it, we somehow ended up getting dragged all the way here!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
U-Um, please give back my glasses!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
In a sense, this is a beautiful sight!    
   
**Ruby:**   
Two beautiful young girls getting completely mobbed by fantastic fairy-tale creatures! (Gulp)    
   
**Illya:**   
Ruby! Stop staring and help!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can we calm them down somehow, Mash?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Roger!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'll use as little firepower as possible!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Me too!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I don't have time to waste here!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**D：Candylander:**   
Magical... girl...?  
  
   
**E：Candylander:**   
A magical girl!?  
  
   
**Candylanders:**   
It's a magical girl!  
There's a magical girl here!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Oh? Are they done resisting?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
There were a lot more people here, but they all ran off.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Was Illya's transformation that scary?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That kind of hurts...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh! Hey, you there. Please, would you hear us out?  
  
   
**D：Candylander:**   
Aaaaahh! It's a magical girl!  
  
   
**D：Candylander:**   
I haven't gone stale yet!  
My expiration date's a long ways off!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
C-Come to think of it...  
You do look delicious...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Spill it. She'll get mad if you don't!  
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
Huh? R-Right!  
R-Rawr!  
  
   
**D：Candylander:**   
AAAHH! A-As you wish, O Magical One!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, well. We managed to get some information.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They said that the Queen of the Land of Sweets might know something.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Medb said she ruled over the Land of Snow and Honey, so it isn't her?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hmm. Is there a misunderstanding here somewhere? If we continue from here, I think we'll end up at this Candy Castle...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Both a queen and a magical girl, eh...  
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
Another queen, huh?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
It feels really strange for a magical girl to live in a castle and rule a country...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
I'm willing to go full Snake on this if you want me to?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
But this Reality Marble is too big to travel the whole way! I can't get too far from Illya!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Candy Castle it is, then.  
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
Y-Yeah...I think you're right.  
But it's a little scary.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
What if it's a magical girl like Rin or Luvia, where magical energy multiplied by violence and age equals destructive power?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, by the way... I've been meaning to ask, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What is that fluffy accessory on top of your head, Master?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It looks kind of like Fou's ears.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A Mystic Code. Da Vinci gave it to me.  
   
**Mash:**   
A-A Mystic Code?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I assume it has some kind of function in this world, but it's very... unique.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is it weird?  
   
**Mash:**   
N-No! It's very cute...  
I mean, it looks good on you! In a way, it is wonderful!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
(Gasp) I-I'm sorry. I didn't notice anything unusual at all.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
It's a little scary that I no longer ask questions about bizarre costumes...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Something is invading and destroying my fashion sense...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
You're going to be the leader of the magical girl fashion world, Illya! It's so unlike you to show weakness!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
More! You have to be more aggressive!  
By the way, are you into Brazilian swimsuits?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
No! A magical girl who fights in a swimsuit is someone who needs to be committed to a hospital!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
(Sigh) Whose fault do you think this is anyway?  
You should feel more responsible!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...Oh, I can see the castle!  
  
   
## 1ins: A Strange, Strange Land of Sweets III  
   
**D：???:**  
Guests! We have guests!  
Oh, what a glorious day!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Come in, welcome!  
Have some delicious sweets!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A girl in a pitch-black dress... Who could she be?  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
My name is Nursery Rhyme!  
Nice to meet you!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Have some tea&ndash;freshly brewed the day before last. Which would you prefer, marmalade or lemon?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's Nursery Rhyme!?  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I'm... Nursery Rhyme?  
If you say so, then I must be!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Let's have a tea party to celebrate the umpteenth time I have encountered someone new!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Nursery Rhyme is a magical girl.  
Tom Thumb's cute little picture book.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
You, a magical girl who fled after completing her duty... And me, broken.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I'll make your wishes come true.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Uh...Doctor?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, I thought you'd forgotten about me.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mm, yes, she's definitely a Servant. Although it seems she is not the owner of the giant Reality Marble.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But at the same time, she's apparently also a Master. I suppose that's only natural, given her ability to control such magical beings.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If she's a Caster-class, this is worth investigating.  
As such, be very careful!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, roger that. Ah! Illya!? Master, you too!?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Just enjoying the tea party?  
Not a hint of anxiety?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
That's my Illya. What a big shot!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Whew, I'm so glad we were able to have a nice chat.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'm Illya. Illyasviel von Einzbern.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Nursery Rhyme, you're not just a magical girl, but also the Queen of the Land of Sweets?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
That's right. I'm a big deal.  
I can command anything.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Th-Then, Your Highness, I have a special favor to ask of you!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Can you please tell me if you or the people of the Land of Sweets know anything about a friend who came to this world with me?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Anything will do!  
If there's anything, then&mdash;  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Sure. If you play with me, I'll tell you.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are there any other magical girls besides you?  
  
  
---  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
If you play with me, I'll tell you the answer to that too.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ugh... Look, Nursery, can't we just play later?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
No! (Shaking head)  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I mean, I'm bored. I'm in a rut.  
My only playmate is a black sheep.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Say, have you seen it? It's a very cute sheep.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
A black... sheep? I-I can't say I have, no.  
M-Meeeh meeeh. Hee hee, just kidding.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Tee hee hee! Nothing like that, Illya!  
That was terrible!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
A black sheep sounds like this:  
Baaaa, baaa.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh yeah, that was the Japanese sound.  
Um, b-baaa, baaa?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Yes, you've got it!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Now, let's all call for it together.  
Baaaa, baaa.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
♪Baa, baa, Glasya-Labolas, have you any blood?  
♪One of the 72 Spirits, President of Hell!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
♪Baa, baa, Black Goat, have you any young?  
♪Iä, Iä, Shub-Niggurath, Glasya-Labolas!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Come to me, come to me! My cute black sheep!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Eeep! Y-Y-Y-Yikes! That isn't part of the rhyme!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Uh, what!? That's...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I'm just so tired of the sweets people. They break straight away, making it impossible to play with them.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Although they were originally humans, so I can't blame them.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
But my black sheep is kinder than anyone.  
It'll play with me forever and ever.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Now, let's play together.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No choice but to go all out, it seems...  
   
**Illya:**   
Her way of playing is really different than mine... (Crying)  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
That's what queens are like.  
They're always hungry for excitement.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
This is too much excitement, don't you think!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash, go help Illya!  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Illya! I'll handle the defense!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I-I'm counting on you, Mash!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
## World End Match: Nursery☆Rhyme  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Ah, that was so much fun!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Huh? What, you're looking for someone? If it's something that simple, you should've told me from the start.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I did!!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
She has black hair, she's a little taller than me, and she's a magical girl like me!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Wait a moment! If we are talking about Miyu's appearance...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
I shall project a number of curated photos and videos from your prized collection, Illya!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Wait, I don't know what you're talking about!  
That can't be good, so stop!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Magical girl? Your friend is a magical girl?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I see...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Then I don't know anything about her.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I think you should just give up. Too bad.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's that supposed to mean?  
  
  
---  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
You know what this world is?  
A merry party hall where magical girls gather.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
When they get tired of playing, they disappear, one after the other.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
That's the rule. There's no getting around it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So there are magical girls other than Queen Medb?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
As far as I know.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
And magical girls who did their best make their own playground.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
My Land of Sweets is one of them.  
Let me see... What else is there...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
There's the Land of Dragons and Sea, the Land of Dead Bookshelves...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Hmm, what else?  
...Oh, the Land of Snow and Honey!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Those are the kingdoms I've heard of, but I don't know what kind of magical girls live there.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Oh, and also...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...Also?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Nothing. Never mind.  
Ah, here. Take this.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
This is to thank you for playing with me and my black sheep. I had fun.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...A j-jewel!? I-It's a diamond!  
A big, beautiful diamond!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
We got an important item! I feel a sense of affinity!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I-I can't accept this!  
It's too valuable!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'm sure Rin would be pleased, but giving it to me...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
It's fine. I'm a magical girl, remember?  
And that... That is my special twinkling star.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
That jewel may help you find your friend.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Fujimaru, what should we do?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank her sincerely and accept it.  
   
**Illya:**   
O-Okay. Maybe it would be rude not to...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Yep, it would be rude.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I'm a queen, so I have no regrets. Ahahaha.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe we can give it back to her later.  
   
**Mash:**   
I agree with Master.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If it can help us in finding Miyu, then I think we should just give in and borrow it.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
R-Right. Then we'll take it.  
We'll give it back to you later, Nursery.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ruby:**   
You did it, Illya! Let's keep going like this and gather more jewels!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Um, Ruby, have you lost sight of our goal?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
We don't even know how this jewel will come in handy yet.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
By the way, Mash, have you noticed?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. Are you talking about that last battle?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
My attack on Nursery Rhyme actually had an effect on her&ndash;albeit not completely.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Perhaps she and Queen Medb possess different traits, even though they're both magical girls?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Or perhaps I myself have changed in some way?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I can't detect any significant changes in Mash's status from here.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
That's not true. Mash's MG Power is skyrocketing!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
MG Power? The magical systems in other worlds sure are original...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Talking Mystic Codes alone are unusual,  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
but that personality is so unique that it goes beyond rare and into the realm of junk...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
My apologies for all the trouble.  
Please ignore 90% of whatever Ruby says.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...Ah! The jewel! This light... It's so bright!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Nursery Rhyme's jewel is clearly pointing us in a fixed direction.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm. And the direction is...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Going by topography inside the Reality Marble that we've already identified, it's toward a group of islands situated in an ocean.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm guessing this is the “Land of Dragons and Sea” that Nursery Rhyme mentioned?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
The Land of Dragons and Sea...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All right, let's check it out!  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...So we're not going to the Land of Snow and Honey, where Queen Medb is?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
“When in magical lands, do as the mages do,” is it? I see. That might be the case here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'll follow your instincts, Master.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Yes, I think that's a good idea.  
We don't know enough about this world.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
At this rate, we could end up going in circles... or even worse, fall prey to a terrible trap!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But if the decision's been made, then come on!  
Mash, Fujimaru, let's hurry!  
  
   
## 2wei! The Land of Dragons and Sea I  
   
**Miyu:**   
(Huff... puff...)  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
...!  
  
   
**A：???:**  
Miyu.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
...  
  
   
**A：???:**  
Answer me, Miyu. Miyu Edelfelt.  
You still refuse to be mine?  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Don't...touch me. Undo these restraints!  
  
   
**A：???:**  
...That magical energy of yours, flowing through that Voile de Deuil, is simply wonderful.  
  
   
**A：???:**  
But it's not just about the magical energy.  
Your very existence is functioning as a superb vessel.  
  
   
**A：???:**  
Just a little more and it will reach the outside world.  
Just one more step and I'll be able to fulfill my dream.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
I refuse to negotiate with someone who won't show her face!  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
Heh-heh. I'm the First Lady.  
That's what they call me.  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
As long as all of you are magical girls, you can't resist me.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Sto...Mm, nghh...  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
Tsk. You bit my lip.  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
You look submissive, but you're a stubborn one, aren't you?  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
I don't mind that.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
...Hmm? The First... Are you...?  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
Heh. Those restraints, the Voile de Deuil, are alive.  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
Will the spell that continues to eat away at your magical circuits reach your subconscious mind first...  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
...or will your precious Illyasviel arrive here first?  
I wonder which it will be.  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
Either way, I will accomplish it.  
The dream of abandoned girls...  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Unh...  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Illya...  
  
   
## 2wei! The Land of Dragons and Sea II  
   
**Illya:**   
Wow, it's the ocean! I can see a dolphin swimming over there, too!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I still can't believe that this is someone's imaginary world.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Me neither. The scale of it is as large as a Holy Grail phenomenon.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Speaking of which, we were lucky that Ruby was equipped with a navigation mode.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You truly are all-purpose. Sailing wouldn't have been possible had we been on our own.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'm surprised to see Ruby is actually helpful.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Aw, you're praising me too much! (Embarrassed)  
...Hey! I'm always helpful!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
I have up to 24 secret functions!  
I can pretty much do anything, you know!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Since we're taking a refreshing voyage, why don't we eat?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
That's a good idea.  
Oh, are these bento boxes from Chaldea?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Can we each choose our own?  
...I can hardly decide. Illya, which one would you like?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Yay! I'm actually starving! Eeny, meeny, miney, mo...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Mapo tofu)  
   
**Illya:**   
Eep, it's hot! Is this freshly made!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What? Senpai, did you cook this yourself?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A chef in a red overcoat taught you how? With ingredients the doctor provided? When did you...?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
This mapo tofu is amazing! I can actually eat it! It's not a dangerous-looking color! It's a little bit spicy, yet slightly sweet!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Awww, I never imagined such safe mapo tofu existed in this world!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Is that supposed to be your review of the dish?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's so tasty, it's comforting.  
But I'm not sure if it's good enough to make you cry.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, take your time, Illya.  
Mapo will never attack you, I think.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
(Om nom nom) This is so good.

**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Pickled mushrooms)  
   
**Illya:**   
P-Pickled mushrooms!? In a one-kilogram jar!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wh-Who supplied this to us?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Leonidas? He succeeded in growing mushrooms in Chaldea?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I didn't know he had such a hobby. I'm impressed. (Adjusts glasses)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's even warm rice and everything. Very well then. Don't mind if I do.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Sniff, sniff... Lick) ... (Om nom nom)  
... Oh, actually, this is good.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
It's delicious! (Om nom nom)  
I feel it will help me vigorously speed up my mundane work!

**Dr. Roman:**   
Hi, are you still eating?  
No need to stop, but just listen.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There are some things I need to confirm with Illya.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You mentioned that you magical girls faced some trouble when you tried to move to the Mirror World.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
How do you return to the real world you originally came from? Do you have any idea?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I wasn't thinking about it at all!!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wow, I'm amazed. That might be the secret to the power of magical girls.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So going back is difficult after all...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Um, Ruby? What is your view on this?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Yes? Let me see...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Neither Illya nor Miyu can use spells that advanced.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
To be more exact, even if they somehow cast a spell, they wouldn't have the skill and knowledge to precisely select the location to return to.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
I need them to figure it out themselves.  
After all, I'm just a stick.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Actually, I have no problem with the way it is now, you know?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
No! It's a big problem! You're not being useful at all, Ruby!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But... you're right. I was too busy thinking about Miyu...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I was forgetting about many things.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I understand. You have your family and friends in the original world, Illya.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Yes... Rin and Luvia...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Sella, Leysritt, my big brother... Everyone at school... They might be worried about me...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
(Gasp!)  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
What's wrong? You look very pale.  
Like the pale blue sea! (Smug)  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh my gosh... I forgot something very important...  
  
   
**E：Illya:**   
Chloe...! I left Chloe behind in the real world!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Well, that may be true, but I have a feeling that Chloe is doing okay without you.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Knowing Chloe, instead of worrying about you, she's probably happy to keep Shirou all to herself. She'd be all, “Whoo hoo! Heh heh heh!”  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
That tanned little devil is probably turning on her devilish charm and gloating right now!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You should be worried about other things!  
Like... Like th-that!! Remember THAT!?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Huh? What is it? Can you please explain with words, with that mouth of yours?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Morals!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is Chloe a friend of Illya's?  
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
Um, Chloe is... She's like my twin sister, I guess?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'm sorry. It's a rather long story.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sounds pretty complicated.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm, I can't make empty promises, but I will do all I can.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The fact that your world and our world connected in some sort of magical way...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...is actually a very dangerous situation.  
If we're going to do anything, we need to be careful.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Any news on the Reality Marble?  
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm working on it, too. Ah, I'm so busy theseWait!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Something is approaching you at high speed!  
Flying creatures!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ack!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I have a visual on a number of wyverns!  
Senpai!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The jewel's still showing the same direction, so...  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes! Understood!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But I haven't eaten my dessert!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ruby, come back! We're transforming!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Roger that! Steady!☆  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**A：???:**  
Lord Jason, intruders have broken through the wyverns' defenses and are now approaching.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
You don't have to report every little thing to me.  
I can see that myself!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
A lovely pink magical girl and a black magical girl who looks both sturdy and squishy.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
If you ask me, the former's more gorgeous than you, and the latter's more endowed.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
A crushing loss on your part! For a match to be decided before it's even begun... Jeez! Not even funny!  
  
   
**A：???:**  
Lord Jason, Lord Jason. Please provide an accurate comparison of the enemies once again.  
  
   
**B：Burnt Jason:**   
Yes. I will rephrase my analysis.  
  
   
**B：Burnt Jason:**   
The former's not as flowery (read: callous) as you, and the latter's not as sexy (read: crazy).  
  
   
**B：Burnt Jason:**   
Now what do you think?  
  
   
**A：???:**  
Oh, my... Lord Jason, what embarrassing compliments you brazenly give me.  
  
   
**A：???:**  
But lying is no good.  
  
   
**A：???:**  
The pink one's not as physically developed as I am, and the black one's clad in colder, more impersonal colors.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
(Did she just ignore me? And so effortlessly!)  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Whatever. In any event, I successfully got around your unreasonable demands!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
You always make things a deadly venture, even in casual conversation!  
  
   
**A：Medea Lily:**   
Yes. I love peace, but I have no sympathy for intruders.  
  
   
**A：Medea Lily:**   
I shall punish thieves.  
  
   
**A：Medea Lily:**   
Sister Circe said that you can ask them what their circumstances are after their punishment ends.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
She's totally right. The Land of Dragons and Sea isn't as sweet and as smart as, well, me.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Everyone here is gentle, the people are happy, they all worship me&ndash;or so it seems.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
But in actuality, there's a crazy queen who turns any bad kiddies into piggies, no matter how small their crimes!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
That's the reality of this oceanic dictatorship, this Medea Psycho Land! Hahahaha, help me!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Lord Jason. Did you say something?  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Nothing important.  
I was just giving a speech.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Anyway, it's a war. We're fighting a war, Medea.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Seems the girls took the wyverns down without a hitch. In my great wisdom I expected as much.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
What? So you weren't actually bringing out the big guns with those wyverns? Lord Jason, what on earth are you planning?  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Humph. What do you think the best weapon to defeat your enemy in battle is?  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
It's not a powerful Noble Phantasm or natural disaster. It's carelessness. It's being careless, Medea.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
A relaxed mentality is the poison that kills humans.  
I'll secretly make them realize that later!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Hahaha! They'll be very proud of themselves after defeating those wyverns, and I'll be the one to break that pride!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Of course, I will destroy them, ship and all! Remember, magical girls are as stubborn as they come!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Just when you think you've defeated them, just when you breathe a sigh of relief, there they are the next day!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
“Rise and shine, Lord Jason,” they'll say. “It's morning♡” they'll say!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
That's my waking nightmare, so that is the horror I will inflict upon them!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Understood. So we'll make them deader than dead.  
Got it.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Come on, Magical Ship in a Bottle, release!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
But... please forgive me. I didn't know how much to prepare for the ship...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
All I managed was five dozen Dragon Tooth Warriors and a ram bearing a curse that decays the enemy's keel.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
That's all I have on hand.  
My apologies.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
...So you always carry all that around? How terrifying. I'm curious as to what your definition of a peace-loving heart is.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Yes! I'm not good in battle, but I'll do my best!  
All right everyone, charge!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
...Okaaaay, so you're not listening at all, but that's awesome! My wife is the best of the best!  
  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Mash:**   
M-Master! Now there's a galley charging at us!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
What? There's more? They don't have any intention of talking at all!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Even if we were the ones who trespassed into their territory first, they're still so aggressive!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just hang in there, you two!  
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
I powered up with a yummy lunch, so I'm fine!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Are you still alive, Fujimaru!? I know it's tough already, but now you've got a Servant to deal with!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We're winning, but they won't let up!  
They're closing in on us!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is it this kingdom's magical girl?  
She's a very cautious and well-prepared opponent.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Yup, I can feel them getting closer.  
We have Nursery's stone to thank for that.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Wah! That's them! That's...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Greetings, visitors from another world.  
I am Medea...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
The Magical Girl of Love and Healing, Medical☆Medea.  
A pleasure to meet you.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Th-That outfit...! Ruby, is she...!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Yup! It's a liiittle different, but that formal-yet-naughty slit is definitely Caster!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Caster, the mage Servant! Illya's first real opponent!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Yes, that's right!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'm sorry about what happened!  
I'm Illya! Illyasviel!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Illya, do you know her?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Yes, but she may not know me...  
Oh, but who's that handsome doll?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Are we acquaintances?  
Oh my...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I wouldn't have been so rough if I'd known. I'm sorry.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I don't dwell on the past... So even if we were friends...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Why don't we forget about it and focus on the present? It's easier to forget the bad things that happened in the past, right?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Huh...?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Yes. So let's forget about our battle just now.  
We can just chalk it up to a mistake on both sides.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...She lowered her staff... Whatever the case, I'm glad the fight's over.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I think we can resolve this by talking, like magical girls are supposed to!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm not so sure...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If we can actually talk to her...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Talking? That's a wonderful idea.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
If you could take an opponent's life just through conversation, that's better than fighting.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
That's how you obtained that jewel, isn't it?  
That jewel covered in the blood of its former owner?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Which kingdom's magical girl did you kill?  
I'm sure it was a very difficult fight.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Would you tell me how you did it?  
I'd like to know... just for reference, of course.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Th-That's not how it happened, Medea!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I did end up battling a magical girl, but...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
We didn't try to kill each other.  
Nursery gave this to me.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
...  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I see. I understand. So you came from Nursery Rhyme's kingdom.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
And now you've come to take my jewel.  
Hehe. How energetic and strong-minded you are!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
As a magical girl, you're not someone I can welcome, but as a queen, you're not someone I can ignore either!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Am I right, Lord Jason?  
They say they're gathering jewels.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I would like to praise you for your bravery and recklessness. Everyone, would you come to my castle?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Tell me of your travels on the way. It's been centuries since I've been able to talk to a magical girl!  
  
   
## 2wei! The Land of Dragons and Sea III  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
This castle belongs to me and Lord Jason.  
Please come inside.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
(Psst... “Lord Jason”? Does she mean that doll?)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(I think so...)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
By the way, Medea...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can I ask you a question?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Anything you like, as long as it's something I remember. Oh, but I already know what you're going to ask.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
You're thinking I might be Medea, the Heroic Spirit of the Princess of Colchis. Correct?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Well, hehe, you're wrong. It's true that I was born from Princess Medea, yes...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
But I'm not the Servant you think I am.  
Even if she exists in your world, it's a different person.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I was merely modeled after Princess Medea.  
I am but a young girl's fantasy.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I act like Medea, I get sad like her, laugh like her, and I live happily in the tiny world I was given.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
The Servant System is an active summoning system, but we are passive, and born from the unconscious.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Our purpose was different from the start.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A different purpose? You didn't come here because you were summoned?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
That's right. I was wished to be this way.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
And there is no final goal in this wish.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
There's only a sudden end. Even if we saved the world, we weren't able to end.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Because as long as we were sought, the next story would soon begin.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
But that's all in the past, now that I've found myself here.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I see. I understand your situation.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
So unlike Illya, you wandered here from a different world, did you, Fujimaru?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
To find oneself in a strange land, and not know what to do... That helpless feeling is something I know well.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
So I won't just turn you into a pig. To tell you the truth, that was my original intention when I invited you here.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Oh, I knew it. I knew this castle reeked of ash.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Probably has all the walls ready to scatter special caustic lime.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Stuff that would turn you all into little piglets.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
As expected from a priestess from the Age of Gods, her magecraft is on a different level than ours.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Hyah!? Ruby, you should've said that earlier!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh, but, but... if you're going to leave Fujimaru be, then you can do the same for me...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
No. You're different. You're a magical girl.  
I'm very cruel to magical girls.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
What? But I don't want to be betrayed anymore.  
That girl won't betray me? I should trust your eyes?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She's talking to Jason again...  
We can't hear him though...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Very well... This is what Lord Jason says:  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
“That magical girl isn't smart enough to lie. Her heart is as free of deceit as her chest is of breasts.”  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Excuse me, but can I karate-chop him?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
What? No! I'm the only one who can have my way with Lord Jason, so please don't.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Anyway, Lord Jason is being gentlemanly for once.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
He's saying to call off the sneak attack and talk with you instead.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh, uh... That's what we were planning from the start, so we can talk all you want.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
No, I'm not interested in your problems.  
I don't care about other magical girls.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
What I'm going to offer you is a peaceful trade.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
This island and this castle remind me of Corinth.  
I simply want to continue my tranquil life here.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Whatever you do outside this land, I promise I won't interfere.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's fine with me. Does everyone agree?  
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
Yup, of course! If we weren't just attacked out of nowhere like that, we wouldn't have...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Right, Mash?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But what about the jewel's guidance?  
And what did you mean by “trade”?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I meant that, just as I won't interfere with your business, you won't interfere with mine.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
And no, no matter how much you want it, you can't have this jewel. I've named it the “Tomoi Stone.”  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
This stone is what supports this oceanic kingdom, and gives me my power.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
This world is big, but it's also tightly closed.  
There were once many more magical girls here.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
They all wanted a kingdom of their own, and so fought with and stole from each other.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I was one of those girls.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I am a healer. A medical magical girl.  
I have barely any means of attacking.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
The most I have is mental offense and divine punishment&ndash;things like pig transformation, tiny world confinement, and so on.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
The battle was very difficult. I was a relatively weak magical girl, after all.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ugh... It's like hearing an amazing swimmer say,  
“But I don't know how to fly.”  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not sure, but I think Jason is saying,  
“There's nobody as scary as you!”  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Silence, you barbarians, you who specialize in destruction! ...Speaking of which, I want to try a Buster Noble Phantasm too!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Ahem. Excuse me. I'll get back on topic.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
The magical girls fought each other in pursuit of their own ideals for peace and order. It was a clash of values and worldviews.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I tried to run from the fierce combat, but it was impossible.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Each time an enemy came I would just stab, stab, and stab some more...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Medea...  
   
**Illya:**   
That's awful... Medea...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Stab what now?  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, it's probably best to ignore that.  
Who knows when Rule Breaker might show up?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Before long, this stone that appeared in my hand grew in weight and shone brighter each time I fought.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I can tell. This stone is the catalyst that supports this fantasy.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What of the area outside the kingdoms' jurisdiction?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
You must be talking about the areas where the magical girls' influence doesn't reach.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
That's the neutral zone: a buffer zone born from the balance of power that all the fighting gave rise to.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
You cannot receive the blessings of your power there.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Do you understand? This jewel is the only small hope I have left.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Taking this from me would be equivalent to my death.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
So the only thing I can give you is a promise to leave you alone. Illya, I won't try to steal your jewel.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
So please leave. With that jewel you can create whatever land you want.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
If you want something, use your stone to get it instead.  
If you want friends, make a land of friends.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I'm sure it'll be wonderful. A place where everyone who visits becomes your friend.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That isn't right.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I don't want more friends.  
I want to be with one I already have.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
We go to school together... We laugh together...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Sometimes we fight and go our separate ways, but even then, before long our desire to see each other again becomes too great.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I was able to meet someone like that, someone as important to me as myself.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
So I don't need anything else.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Compared to you and your wish to just live in peace,  
I know it's a very greedy and selfish goal, but...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'm sorry! Please! I came here to save my friend!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'm not here to steal your jewel!  
I don't even really know what they do!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You know a lot about this world.  
If you could just give us some clues...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
...A way to get out?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
It may seem cruel, Illya, but you cannot leave this world now.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Not only can you not save your friend, there's no exit for you either. As long as you're a magical girl.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
No, you won't even have the will to leave...  
That's how desperate this place is.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
In the end, you will always be a weak magic user, a weak magical girl...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
One who could only make miracles happen for the sake of her friends.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
So in the end, you will definitely come to rely on the power of that jewel.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Just like we did, burning each other to ash as we clung to that tiny hope...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
In the end, I'm going to rely on this jewel?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Give up on this Miyu girl. If you want to know how to make friends, I'll happily teach you.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
That is the one thing I can do for Nursery Rhyme, the girl who gave you that jewel and disappeared.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Huh? Wait, what does that&mdash;  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
The jewels are where our wishes dwell.  
They are the last light that keeps us alive...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
When Nursery Rhyme let hers go, she quickly vanished into nothingness.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Of course, there's no need for you to be sad.  
That was her choice.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
And even without waiting for her destruction...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
That greedy Medb, Queen of the Land of Snow and Honey, would never ignore her.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
The Land of Sweets will fall to Medb's forces sooner or later.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Perhaps Nursery let you escape from Medb's clutches.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
No...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
No... I'm sorry...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I didn't know... I'm sorry, Nursery...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But I...! I have to... I have to save Miyu no matter what...!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Oh dear. It was probably your stubbornness that drove Nursery to action.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Or maybe she'd given up herself, and was on the verge of disappearing.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Even if she could not do it, she entrusted her hope to someone promising who still&mdash;  
Aargh! Geez!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
It's so stupid! That's the problem with sugar-brained magical girls who come from fairy tales!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Medea!? What is this dangerous aura around her?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Half-assed hope! How many times do you have to get betrayed before they're satisfied?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Wake up, Lord Jason! Let me hear some of those nasty little comments you always make!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? Jason changed...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She's finally shown her true self!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Ha! This is great! The type of person Medea wants to see least in the world has come to visit her.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Someone who keeps going, even towards uncertainty. Someone who tries hard, even if they don't know how.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Someone who does their best no matter how battered and bruised they get! Someone who doesn't even think about compensation!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Medea! Just like you when you were in the temple, before you joined me!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
That's why you're showing your true self!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
What you feel isn't anger born of hatred.  
It's righteous rage, born of sorrow!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Don't tell me that, after all this, you're feeling sorry for yourself and wishing you'd tried a little harder!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
N-No! I wasn't... I didn't...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I am the Queen of the Land of Dragons and Sea!  
A priestess of the goddess Hecate!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
You were never able to become king, no matter what you did, so I built a kingdom for you and settled down!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Yes, that's right. That's right. You couldn't even kill yourself. So that's what's right for you.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Which means now, you must follow your own fate!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
You can work, work hard, or work even harder! A magical girl is all about doing things all the way! Right?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Oh, um... Th-That's... That's right!  
I'll do it! I'll get to work!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Good answer! Let's see, to start with...  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
The Spartoi Family's “Adventure on Siren Island” diorama has a long ways to go!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Right, Lord Jason!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Plus that 1/48th scale Argo kit and the Supermobile DX Talos are still in their boxes!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
You're not going to call yourself Greece's greatest builder without completing those two, are you? Aren't you embarrassed?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I'm sorry, Lord Jason! But I gave Talos to Europa...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What are they talking about?  
   
**Illya:**   
Huh? I'm having trouble following this...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe they used to be hardcore scale modelers?  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
The God Nipper that Hephaestus forged for you is crying!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Yes, Ultimate! You're right, Lord Jason!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
All right, you're finally fired up! It was worth making you talk to those people, even if it was a pain!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
That non-aggression pact is useless now! We're dang lucky a jewel came to us before Medb arrived!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
You lost the will to fight, so this is truly your last chance!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
All you can do is heal? Don't be stupid, ignoramuses!  
I think you're great!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Right, my pretty little Medea?  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Show me once more how violent it is to not be able to die in battle!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
R-Right! Thank you! I will! I will!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
...Um.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
It looks like she couldn't handle her guilty conscience as a healing-type magical girl, and pushed all her will to fight onto her familiar.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
It's common for magical girls in puberty to be dependent like that.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I didn't want to know that! And Medea looks like she really wants to fight!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh, Mash... Are you going to transform!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Medea won't be an easy opponent!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If we have to, we can use the Rayshift to at least get Master out of here and&mdash;Doctor?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Doctor? Doctor!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The connection with Chaldea's been cut!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Of course it has. Don't underestimate a modeler. When I use an airbrush, I always mask things up properly.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I severed your link with the outside world the minute you arrived at this castle.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ungh! I'm sure you've noticed, Master...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But the castle's surrounded not just by humanoids, but by large creatures as well!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Here we go again!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Aren't magical girls supposed to become friends after they talk to each other?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Hahaha! You're one to talk, aren't you?☆  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll have to fight them!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I know how you feel, but don't give in!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
Fujimaru...  
(That's right. I can't cause any more trouble for them!)  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Right...! I'll do what I can!  
  
   
## World End Match: Medical☆Medea  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Aaaaah!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Whew, I guess healing alone wasn't enough, but I already knew that! Hahahaha!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
By the way, you hot magical girls over there!  
You feel like going for a ride on my Argo?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Look out, Lord Jason!  
  
   
**F：Burning Jason:**   
Oof!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Heh-heh... Even as words of concern spilled from your mouth, you specifically went for a head shot...  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Is that you telling me you haven't given in yet, my Medea? Maybe you still have another card up your sleeve?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Of course! It's natural for magical girls to have two stages of transformation!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I don't want to, but I have no choice but to unleash my forbidden power! To be specific, I will no longer be Lily!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Hey, whoa, wait. Let's slow down.  
If you're not going to be Lily, you're going to be THAT?  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
It's that form that burned down the castle in Corinth. That's bad. That's really bad! It's too monstrous!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
We're having a magical girl party, so if a magical old hag appears, I'll be sued for false advertising!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
And believe me, you would be the one who gets hurt if that happened!  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
I'm telling you this for your own good. I'd much rather become an indescribable pillar-like thing than have that happen! Oof!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Quiet, Lord Jason!  
Medea is serious, Master!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I wouldn't get hurt at all!  
And I won't be an “old hag” 10 years from now!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I'm sure I will be a lovely, elegant adult woman!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A beautiful woman, yes, but elegant?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Leave her be. She'll self-destruct.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
No, let's stop her, Senpai! If she becomes any sadder, the situation will get out of control!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That's enough!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
The battle ends here!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I just came here to save Miyu, not destroy the entire kingdom!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
B-But a magical girl is supposed to fight!  
And besides, my modeler soul has been ignited...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I'll defeat you, make a mold of you, and mass-produce it for our country's new fall lineup...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Please don't come up with a convoluted plan within minutes of our first encounter! Are you psycho!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uuuuuuh-ooooohh...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Somebody finally said it...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
I don't understand this world, these jewels, or any of you!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I hate this kind of stuff! And I don't need any jewels!  
I'll find another way!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That's why, Medea... I don't want to fight you!  
I don't want to fight anymore!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
After all, we're both magical girls!  
Medea, I don't know why you created this land...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But I at least understand that you have something you hold dear! Something you've been fighting for!  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Illya... Um, that...is very moving, but...  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Medea fights for no special reason.  
It's not for the sake of something she “holds dear.”  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Lord Jason!?  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
She created this land because she felt indebted to me. And she's been protecting the jewel out of fear of other magical girls.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
She made an excuse to live a quiet life because she believed that would keep her from becoming a menacing witch.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
I tell you, she's frivolous about everything. The only time she gets serious is when she's building models.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I...admit that. But it was you, Lord Jason, who commanded me to confine myself here.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Well, of course. If you leave your own land, you'll become a witch. That's your fate.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
And if you become a witch, you turn into just another Echo. That's why I advised against going to other lands.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Echo?)  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
But you don't need to worry anymore. Here, young lady. You want this, don't you? Take it.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
A-Are you sure!? After all, without this, um, lots of things...  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Spare me the details.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
If we beat you, then I win.  
But if we lose, then Medea loses... Get it?  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
I'm twisted that way. I wouldn't give that stone away to anyone who wants it.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
I will, however, push it into the hands of a noble fool who says they don't. Whether they like it or not.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
That's okay with you, isn't it, Medea?  
Either way, we'd lose if we went to war against Medb.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Before that happens, it feels better to pass it all on to a fool who is a lot like you in the past.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I... don't mind. But are you sure about this, Lord Jason?  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
I'm not happy, but I'm used to it.  
Fading away while indulging in past glories...  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
But not becoming a witch is more important than that. Even if your dreams are dashed, it's better to pass on as a girl.  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
Isn't that right, my Medea?  
  
   
**Mini Jason:**   
And I think of this as my life coming to a close at one final stop in an unknown land before returning to my home.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
...  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I understand. As it is Lord Jason's wish, I will give her the jewel.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
However, I won't tell you anything.  
If I talk, it will only bring back sad memories.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Like all of the girls I have slain, my fate will end here.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Medea. Um, you're going to disappear here, too?  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Yes. But even without “hope,” I still have  
“lingering attachments,” so it will take a while.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
After all, I still have 287,000 plastic models to finish.  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
At three models a day, it'll take me 250 years!  
Go, go, Medea!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see. So Princess Medea's magecraft was what interfered with the transmissions.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So what happened? Were you able to get any new information?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We learned about the hidden side of Medea Lily.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. That Medea and the Heroic Spirit Medea have separate existences, but plenty of things in common.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I think what we got a glimpse of in battle this time applies roughly to both Medeas.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We got the jewel.  
   
**Mash:**   
Illya obtained the second jewel.  
But that's all.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Medea said we'd better investigate the basics of this world on our own.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmmm... From what I'm hearing, it sounds like Princess Medea knows everything, but kept her silence.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Was that a dig against Illya, or was it out of thoughtfulness?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Either way, I'm glad no one was hurt.  
Huh? Where is Illya? I don't see her.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Illya said it was too windy here, so she went to the stern. Ruby is with her.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Um, Ruby...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Yo ho! You called?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
What's this? You seem down in the dumps.  
Even after a major victory of a sort.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That was no major victory.  
Medea wasn't going all-out to begin with.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
She fought because she had to, because we muscled our way into her land.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...And in the end, I took that jewel away from her...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
I think you're looking at it the wrong way.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Sometimes people have no use for something, but can't throw it away because that would be a waste.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
I think that's what this jewel was to Medea.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
She's a very powerful magical girl, you know.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Even without the jewel, she would've been able to create her own land.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...Yeah. But despite her power, Medea was glum and haunted by dark memories.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
She said I wouldn't be able to escape from this world... so long as I'm a magical girl.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I wonder if that's true...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Well, I can't say for sure either.  
But what will you do if it is?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
When you get Miyu back, want to create the Land of Squee-Squee-Hee-Hee Love or something for the two of you?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
I'll be willing to cooperate, heeheehee!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Hey! What are you talking about, Ruby!? Sheesh...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ahhh, I wish Chloe were here at a time like this!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...This is a weird world. It's cute on the surface, but I think there's more to it.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
We have to hurry up and find the owner of the Reality Marble. If we can do that, we should be able to find a clue as to Miyu's whereabouts.  
  
   
## 3rei!! The Land of Dead Bookshelves I  
   
**Miyu:**   
(Pain... in my chest...)  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
(Is this... a dream? Whose... dream...?)  
  
   
**???:**  
Mila! Mila...! So it was you...  
  
   
**???:**  
It can't be... Why... ?  
  
   
**???:**  
What... are you going on about...?  
  
   
**???:**  
Becoming a magical girl, one who makes everyone happy, was... your... dream... wasn't it?  
  
   
**???:**  
That's why... this was destined... to happen to me sooner or later...  
  
   
**???:**  
You musn't cry about it.  
  
   
**???:**  
But Mila... Without you, there's no way I can be... a magical girl!  
  
   
**???:**  
Mila... Please... Don't die...  
  
   
**???:**  
Don't... leave me alone...  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
(This is... Yes... This is her dream...)  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
(Such a... sad dream...)  
  
   
## 3rei!! The Land of Dead Bookshelves II  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We've finally made it to the next kingdom.  
You're about to arrive at...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I think it's the Land of Dead Bookshelves.  
The two jewels keep showing this direction.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm... I'm not seeing any signs of life.  
I guess the area lives up to its name.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's so quiet. It's not like the other lands we've been to.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's empty, but unlike the neutral zones, there's a sternness to it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, Illya, look. There's a huge black wall over there...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's gently curving into a dome.  
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That appears to be a completely different area next to the Land of Dead Bookshelves.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It worries me that that I can't get any readings from beyond the wall.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's strange. It feels deliberate, doesn't it?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Could there really be a magical girl in a place like this?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
EEEEK!!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
A-A ghost!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Get back!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Have you never seen a ghost-type enemy before, Illya?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Aah... M-Mash...(Cling)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's okay. Leave it to me.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is this ghost trying to go somewhere?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
What should we do, Master? Please give me your orders.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's alone. Let's go around it.  
   
**Mash:**   
Roger. We'll circle around it and watch for other enemies.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hehehe, you're such a kid, Illya.  
   
**Illya:**   
I don't deny that! So what?!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So we'll avoid combat then?  
Roger. It doesn't seem like it wants to hurt us.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
It left without doing anything. It seems to have headed for the black wall.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Looks like it was just wandering...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Whew. That was scary.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But thanks, Mash.  
For not hurting the ghost.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Illya...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, thank Senpai instead of me. Hehe.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Are you worried about that ghost?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Yeah. It was really scary... but it also seemed kind of sad.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We're almost to the center of the ruins.  
There's still nobody here.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
It's so quiet it almost hurts your ears.  
It would be a good place to read a book, though.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Doctor? How's it looking?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The link with Chaldea is still stable.  
But there are no reactions around you.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
The guiding light of the jewels disappeared, too.  
What do we do?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I know!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'll fly a little and look down from above!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see. That's a good idea. This is a tiny land, and I don't think there are any flying creatures.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
It's okay then? Alright, off I go!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay. Just be careful.  
   
**Illya:**   
Right!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Illya's flying is so graceful. So wonderful, she's like flower petals dancing in the sky.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Flying around in a miniskirt is what makes a magical girl!  
   
**Illya:**   
...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Um, the way you're looking up is kind of awkward.  
It's like how Ruby looks at me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please go ahead, Illya.  
I'll shield you from Senpai's gaze.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Okay!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, do I need to help you calm down a bit?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, I'm actually jealous of the way she can fly, too.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh? You need to speak to me in private?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, you see...  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I... in the Chaldea control room...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm surprised. I didn't realize something so strange had happened.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
While it's true that my memories from the time I visited the control room up until our Rayshift jump are hazy...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I didn't really worry about it. Was I swept up in the aura of this strange world...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Or did something change within me, somehow?  
  
   
**B：???:**  
Eeek! D-Don't pull me!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's Illya's voice!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, enemies are coming through the walls of the buildings! There's so many!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
These ghosts are clearly attacking!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's meet up with Illya as we fight through!  
   
**Mash:**   
Right! Let's hurry!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Transform into Demi-Magical Girl Chaldea☆Mash, fou!  
   
**Mash:**   
Right! Huh!? Fou??  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, we need to have a talk later!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Illya:**   
T-They're strong! Why are these monsters so strong!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
More incoming!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wait. That building was empty earlier, but someone...  
  
   
**D：???:**  
What's all this commotion?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
I'm shocked that a magical girl would still visit a land that's drained of all its magical energy.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Are you this land's magical girl!?  
The Land of Dead Bookshelves?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(All the ghosts left when she came out.)  
  
  
---  
   
**D：???:**  
Yes. ...One of them.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Oh, I see. I'm sorry. The others gave you a rather brutal welcome.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Are you hurt? Do you need healing?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No. They were very powerful, but fortunately we weren't badly injured.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Did you just say “the others”?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
That's right, newcomer.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
This is the graveyard of magical girls.  
All the ghosts in these ruins were once magical girls.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
I'm just a gravekeeper. And a librarian. I'm not a queen, and I haven't been a magical girl for a long time.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Magical girl... g-ghosts!? Ahhhh!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Will you tell us your name?  
   
**D：???:**  
Ghosts don't need names, do they?  
But it would be difficult to talk without a name. Hmm...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Helena. You can call me Helena.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Madame Blavatsky?  
   
**Mash:**   
You're Missus... I mean, Lady Blavatsky?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Oh, you know me. I shall not deny it if you call me by that name.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
I believe my mental state more closely resembles my von Hahn years, though.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Well, feel free to just call me Helena.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
But I don't plan on being your friend.  
Please keep that in mind.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Okay, Magical Girl Helena, then.  
Doctor Romani? Is she...?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Don't worry, Illya. Also, I'm quite happy to know you remembered my name and title.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, she's not a ghost.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Like the other magical girls you've met, she has a Spirit Origin response similar to a Servant's.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Of course, she's alive.  
Was she camouflaging her life signs...?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
What are these magical energy waves?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
The man in that image... Could it be...  
A leyline directly linked to a parallel world?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
So that's it. She found a foothold out to the outside world.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, what does that mean?  
Don't just satisfy your own curiosity!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
“She”? Do you mean Medb!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Do you know something, Helena!?  
She took away my frie...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Wait. This is not the best place to talk.  
Come to my library.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
And undo your transformations.  
It's better that way.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
U-Um, Illya can, but I'm not a magical girl...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But if that last fight was just an accident, I'd like to say that we are not here to fight you. I'll disarm temporarily.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is that alright, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Roger that.  
   
**Mash:**   
Okay. Come, Illya, let's accept her invitation.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash! Transform back, fou!  
   
**Mash:**   
M-Master...?  
C-Could you stop that already...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fine... Here we go, okay!?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
## 3rei!! The Land of Dead Bookshelves III  
   
**Illya:**   
Wow, look! A whole wall full of old books...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
What's wrong, Ruby? You're shaking.  
You haven't talked much since we came here.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
N-Nothing... (Shiver) Y-You haven't noticed? (Shiver)  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Illya, you're s-s-s-s-s-such...W-W-Well, i-if you d-don't know, i-it's better that way... (Shiver)  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You're being weird, Ruby.  
Oh, a stuffed lion!  
  
   
**Mini Edison:**   
...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
That's my former partner.  
It's been a long time since he's spoken.  
  
   
**Mini Edison:**   
...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Huh!? Partner?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Whispering) I've never seen anything so bizarre.  
No wonder I couldn't search inside...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru, Mash, every book on that shelf is a grimoire.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All of them!?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Yes. For many years these ruins have been called the Land of Dead Bookshelves.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I'll tell you why.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
The ghosts outside, as well as all the books in this room, they were once magical girls.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
This is the graveyard of those poor girls who were plunged into this world. They're called “Echoes.”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Echoes... You mean the echoes of magical girls.  
Jason used that word too.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Jason? Of the Land of Dragons and Sea?  
You're more adventurous than you look.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Wasn't that place dangerous?  
But don't worry, everyone here is peaceful.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
They just sleep here, in the form of grimoires.  
Many magical girls liked to read.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
The Echoes who attacked you outside wanted someone to join them...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Or perhaps they wanted to match spells with a rival, as they once did.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
The reason the Echoes don't attack me is because my role here is to serve guests.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
And I have the jewel that's a symbol of my role.  
That's all.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you the owner of the Reality Marble?  
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
Me? No, that's not me. I don't own the Reality Marble.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Then you're already aware that this world is inside a vast Reality Marble.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
This world was created by a single magical girl.  
She's called the First Lady.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
That's what the Echoes whisper to me.  
I've never met her myself.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
It's said that the First Lady is in a sealed space at the center of this world, beyond the black wall.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
No magic can destroy that black wall, and there's no way to know what's inside.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Wait, then what about Medb?  
The one from the Land of Snow and Honey?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Medb is a magical girl. A very powerful one.  
But she's not the First Lady.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Illya, right? Tell me the rest of your story.  
Why are you so focused on Medb?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Don't tell me you're asking if it's okay to defeat her...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
N-No!  
Actually...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I see. A fellow magical girl was kidnapped.  
That's a shame.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
But that's strange. Is that possible?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I thought Medb wasn't interested in anything but the jewels. Did changes in the First Lady have an effect on Medb too?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'd like to ask a question too.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You seem to know an awful lot about parallel worlds.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Of course I do. Part of it is my knowledge of theosophy, but...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
We magical girls were originally invited here from many different parallel worlds.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
We were girls who, for various reasons, couldn't be magical girls in our own worlds anymore.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
We had no choice but to come here. We had nowhere else to go. Here, we could continue being magical girls.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
This is, in a sense, our paradise.  
And it's the final stop on our journey.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then what about Illya and her friend?  
   
**Helena:**   
I don't know. Why not ask the First Lady?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Although... This may sound cruel, but...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Girls who can't accept what's happened to them end up like the Echoes outside.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's a Throne of Heroic Spirits for magical girls?  
   
**Helena:**   
The Throne of Heroic Spirits that's said to be a hall of records within the void? Unfortunately, it's nothing so noble and innocent as that.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
They pathetically clung to being magical girls and fought until they ended up as mere ideas... as Echoes.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I'd really rather not know this, but... there's something I have to ask.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is it possible that I was summoned here as a magical girl too?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Isn't that what makes the most sense?  
You've got a familiar with you.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
 I'm the familiar!?  
   
**Mash:**   
So I really was the cause...  
That's a big shock. How do I face Senpai...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I wouldn't mind being a Mashcot, fou!  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, you stay my Mashter...!  
I mean... no! I-I'm not correcting myself!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
It's nothing for you to worry about, Mash Kyrielight. No...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
The Dangerous Beast-type Magical Girl, Squishy☆Mash, was it?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's Demi-Magical Girl! I mean... Demi-Servant!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
All right. That's all I have to say.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Do you want the jewel?  
Very well. It's yours. Take it.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I named the stone  
“Vril.” But that doesn't matter now.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But...!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Helena, if you don't have that jewel, won't the Echoes outside attack you?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
It doesn't matter. At some point, Medb will come.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I'm not a magical girl anymore. Just a gravekeeper.  
I don't care about the power of the stone.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
There's no need to hesitate. After all, you will eventually meet the same fate.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
The time will come when the world will abandon you, Illya. When you lose your wish.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I'll tell you the most important thing.  
It's about your friend, Miyu Edelfelt.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
This is a guess, but I don't think it was Medb who kidnapped her. It was the First Lady.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I've always assumed that she was silently monitoring this world from beyond the black wall...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
... by transforming her familiars to blend in with those of the other magical girls.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
If you ask Medb, you'll get closer to the truth.  
That is, if she allows you to survive.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Thank you Helena. Miyu was who I wanted to know about most!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But I don't need the jewel.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Even if you needed all the jewels to get beyond the black wall?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
What? All of them?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All the jewels?  
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait. Are you saying we need to take the stones from all the magical girls, including Medb's?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The jewels have enough power to alter the First Lady's Reality Marble?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Yes. The Echoes whispered to me...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
The jewels are crystallized emotions that grant wishes. They should be able to cross the wall, and even reach the outside world.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
But that may be part of what the First Lady wants, too. Even so, there's only one way to find out: get all the jewels.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
See? It's just like I said.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Well, if my theory's right, the First Lady's familiars are capable of crossing the black wall.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
I can't imagine her being dumb enough to let someone else take control of them, though.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That means the First Lady is deliberately making the magical girls fight!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That's awful! We have to stop her!  
But how?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I agree. We are a part of this fight, even if we didn't intend to be...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Illya, you haven't been abandoned by the world.  
   
**Illya:**   
Fujimaru...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Yeah...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
You're going to fight against the rules of this world?  
It's useless.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Illya, how strong do you think your friend is?  
She obviously hasn't been able to resist.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
In this world, the First Lady's power is absolute.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Helena, you aren't washed up either.  
   
**Helena:**   
What are you talking about?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That's right! It's not over for you!  
There are still more things you can do!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
Stop it! Don't insult us!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All the grimoires on the shelves... They're shaking...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Do you think all these girls just accepted their fate, and didn't try to do anything?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But I... I can't stop here!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I can't just accept someone else's despair until I've tried everything for myself!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Miyu... Miyu isn't weak either! She hasn't given up yet!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Helena, you...  
  
  
---  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You were here to bring hope to Illya.  
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
Empty consolation...just like Al.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
What do you... What could the likes of you know about my story!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I'm tired. I want this to be over!  
Just take my jewel already!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Otherwise, I'll put you to sleep here! Forever!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ruby!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Illya...!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'm sorry for transforming without asking, Mash, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But I'm a little mad right now!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
You're about to learn that your hollow wishes are nothing but a fantasy!  
  
   
## World End Match: Mahatma♀Helena  
   
**Helena:**   
(Humph)  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Helena's pouting...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Her cool demeanor from a moment ago has all gone to waste...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Illya was a little rough, but I think what she was trying to say got through.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But what shall we do now?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Illya's not going to want to take the jewel from Helena and expose her to danger.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't know if I like that idea either.  
You look like you want to say something, Master.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well...why don't you come with us, Helena?  
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
That's it! That's a great idea!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Huh?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're coming with us.  
   
**Helena:**   
F-Fine! I was the one who started the fight.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I'll go with you then! Fine!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Magical Girl Helena, help Illya.  
   
**Helena:**   
Now you're just bossy. Sure, fine, fine.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I was the one who started the fight first. I'll obey you! The Command Spells have nothing to do with this, anyway.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Then you're coming with us?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That's great, isn't it, Helena?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
H-Hey! Don't grab me like that! Let go!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I'm just going to witness the inexperienced magical girl's horrible demise. That's all, okay?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Understood?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Okay!  
  
   
## 4ier!!! The Land of Snow and Honey I  
   
**Medb:**   
...  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Hey...  
  
   
**Medb:**   
...  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Hey... (Kick)  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Medb, how long are you going to lie there?  
Get up. (Smack)  
  
   
**Medb:**   
The second most wonderful thing in the world is to see the face of the person you love when you wake up.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
This again?  
  
   
**Medb:**   
I feel the flow of magical energy. I hear the sound of a golden waterfall plunging into the abyss.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Yeah. It looks like the balance of the bounded field is collapsing.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Hehe. Then it's time for the destruction to begin.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
It's time for the march of the Magical Girl-Queen Connacht☆Medb to resound throughout the world!  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
They're cattle. They don't march.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Spare me the details!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Now sound the horn!  
Prepare my chariot!  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Yeah!  
  
   
## 4ier!!! The Land of Snow and Honey II  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm going back to the Land of Sweets to check up on Nursery Rhyme.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Are you sure about that, Illya?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Yep. I'm concerned about her.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I know the gems are pointing at the Land of Snow and Honey as the next destination, but...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'm sorry for troubling you guys with my arbitrary decisions.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please don't be. I think the way you feel about her is very sweet.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sure, it's fine. But we should hurry.  
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
Thank you.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Helena. What kind of magical girl is Connacht☆Medb?  
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
An intense woman.  
She's a magical girl of blazing ice.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Fierce and merciless. A giant mass of possessiveness. Her rigid nature is like a castle that molds her.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
She holds the reins of all kinds of contradictions, tightly knotted together.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
If the root of a magical girl's power lies in her strength to believe in herself, she must be the strongest one.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Does that mean...she's almost insane?  
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
Medb? Of course not. Her sanity is beyond doubt.  
She's absolutely in her right mind.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Perhaps she was the only decent one among the rest of us.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
In this warped world, she was probably the only person who managed to keep being herself till the end.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
She had been in this world since before I arrived.  
There was a time when we journeyed together...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
But I put some distance between us when she became obsessed with her lust for control.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
After that, she dialed up on her madness.  
Or maybe I'm just flattering myself thinking that.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Most likely, she hadn't changed.  
Not at all.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Helena...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Medb said she was ready to accept me as a member of her invincible army.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That's why I mistakenly thought Miyu had been abducted by her.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
The formation of Little Witch Codes to rebel against the First Lady's rule. That was her idea.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
So she hasn't given up on that ambition yet.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
What's the matter, Fujimaru?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hold on, guys... Aren't those Medb's soldiers?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, they are! Those are the snowfield-specialized hostiles!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They appeared in the neutral zone again! We were off our guard! Doctor, why weren't you on alert!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's impossible. We're still on constant alert here. Maybe there was a change in the surrounding environment?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
They're coming straight toward us!  
Doesn't look like talking would do any good... (Gulp)  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to fight.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I may be with you guys, that doesn't make me want to directly stand up against Medb.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
After all, she is one of the magical girls, too.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
In this neutral zone, I wouldn't be able to use that much of my power anyway.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay, then. Stay in a safe area. Mash! Illya!  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Sure, I'll back you up!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Battle completed. Doctor, Doctor!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
There's no response? Is something wrong with the connection to Chaldea again?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Don't glare at me, Mash. Do you think I purposely took you to a dangerous area?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I didn't do anything wrong. Though I admit this was a predictable result.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What exactly do you mean by that? At any rate, this means we can't...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
What!? You guys can't go back to Chaldea!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It seems that way. Oh?  
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru, everyone, are you guys all right!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor! What a relief. I was worried for a moment.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Unfortunately, it's too soon to be relieved.  
Chaldea has been attacked.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What!? This can't be happening...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It is happening. Using our Leyline connection, they sent several hostiles over!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They sent enemies... directly to Chaldea!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's right. We were apparently hacked.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The disconnection you experienced a short while ago was intentional.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We barely managed to deal with the enemies that attacked us thanks to some on-call Servants, but we can't keep this up.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru, Mash, I need you both to return immediately.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So that means...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That said, knowing Mash and Fujimaru,  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm sure you two won't say yes so easily.  
I know that.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But I still need you to understand this is an urgent matter.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
For now, I'll cut the connection again, to prevent any effects from your side.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I will contact you again in five minutes.  
Make a decision by then.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
It's snow. It's starting to snow.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
From what I observed of Medb's familiars and of our surroundings during battle...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I can tell that Medb has started to unleash considerable forces to attack surrounding lands.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can't believe we've endangered Chaldea... I don't know what to say...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Sorry to interrupt your pity-party, Mash, but you should probably deactivate your transformation.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What? Why, Ruby? We've just finished a battle.  
Wouldn't it be dangerous?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
The magical energy that you're using to be a Demi-Servant is completely dependent on your Master at the moment.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
We don't know what will happen from here on, so I think you should be in energy-saving mode as much as you can.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
If we need to act fast against something, Illya and I can handle it.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Yeah. That's right, Ruby. You do have something useful to say sometimes.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You can trust us, Mash!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's true. So this is what happens... when the connection with Chaldea is shut down.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But what should we do now, Senpai?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think we should try to pinpoint the cause.  
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
As the longest inhabitant of this world, I agree with Fujimaru's opinion.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Running back to your parallel world as it is now will not fundamentally solve this issue.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
The threat will not go away on its own.  
This irregular state of danger will continue.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And with Chaldea at risk, it certainly sounds like we need to resolve this.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But are you really okay with that, Senpai? That means that we're going to continue accompanying Illya, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, I mean, I'm not complaining at all!  
I am also happy to help you, Illya.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I... Um, I... Fujimaru, Mash...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Thank you soooo much!  
I can't even find the words to thank you... (Hug)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
D-Don't cry, Illya! Stop groveling on the ground!  
You're practically lying in the dirt!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
(Twinkle☆) Now that's settled, we're going replenish magical energy!! Let's charge!!☆  
  
   
**Illya:**   
What? Huh!? Wh-What are you talking about, Ruby!?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Isn't it important? You'll end up in trouble if you run out of magical energy at a critical moment!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
She may not look it, but Illya is familiar with an efficient technique to charge magical energy.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Really? That's our magical girl!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please teach me, Illya. If it will help us augment our strength, I'm willing to learn anything!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
U-Um... (Whisper)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Okay... O... Kay...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What... ki... tongue... saliva... really?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
(Nodding)...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Uh... I don't know how to react...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Augh...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Okay Mash. Leave the rest to Illya the veteran! Relax. Lightly open your mouth!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Don't worry, this is a type of medical procedure!  
It is appropriate for any age!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Here you go, kiss! Kiss!  
Come on, do it!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
What is this?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Hey, Ruby! This is awkward enough without you butting in!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you'll do it when the time is right?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai... This is... out of my... control...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But I... I'm okay, so...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Charge magical energy.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't charge magical energy.  
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
Oh, a transmission.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All right, let me hear your decision.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What's going on there? Mash, your face's all red.  
Oh, are you mad?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Guess what? They were making a big deal discussing a primitive way to charge magical energy.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hm? A magical energy recharge method with the contractor?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The contract made between Mash and Fujimaru was an irregular case, but...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As always, no special ceremony should be necessary. If you consume an extreme amount of magical energy, just use a Command Spell.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But don't we have something much more crucial to discuss right now? Pertaining to the survival of Chaldea?  
  
   
## 4ier!!! The Land of Snow and Honey III  
   
**Illya:**   
Dr. Romani looked disappointed.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
This is all our fault. I'm sorry.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, there's no need for you to be sorry. Romani Archaman is Chaldea's current commander in charge.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If he felt there was real danger, he would have forced us to transport back.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He didn't do that, which means the doctor understands how important this matter is as well.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yep.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If anything, he was just sulking.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. He's been left out in the cold more than ever this time, so let's thank him again when we get back.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
(That's what she says, but Mash looks like she's sulking a little too.)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway, until the next planned contact, we will have no method of communicating with Chaldea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Since we've chosen to accompany Illya, we must now be even more on our guard.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
How long do you two plan on staying upset?  
We're almost near the border.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
(She's sure straightforward!!)  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Fujimaru, the same goes for you.  
If you're a Master, then get a grip.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Even if you guys are acting out a magical girl fantasy, that doesn't mean your heart has turned into a familiar.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're here!  
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
This is Medb's kingdom?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
It's not as cold as it looks, but it still seems like a magical land.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If the situation was different, this would be some very beautiful scenery.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, wait a minute! We were supposed to be heading towards the Land of Sweets!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Th-That's right!  
What happened?  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Try using your brain for once. It's simple. This place just became a part of the Land of Snow and Honey.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...What!?  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
The transfer of territory. Reallocation of resources. Nothing new. But I've had enough of the cutesy names, though.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Medb's familiar!  
  
  
---  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
And now my job as a gatekeeper covers a huge area.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Medb isn't home. I'm the only one who will be tearing you apart. Be thankful.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
The power of that familiar is overwhelming! He's a familiar, but he can summon magical creatures.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Oh. I thought something smelled dingy. It's Helena.  
Got bored of counting the bookworms in the library?  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Then we gotta pick up our game. According to Medb, she says it's the first step in molding her army.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Can't stop what's already started.  
We want no regrets.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
So I can't have you interfering at this point.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I don't think Medb is a woman who'll falter from the likes of us.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you the ones who sent soldiers into Chaldea?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
O-ho. So Medb finally reached it.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
I see.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Then there's no need to steal the powers of the First Lady. Medb will do as much as she can in her own way.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
If we're already inside enemy territory... Does that mean?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai. Queen Medb said it during the battle.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's a possibility my attacks won't work again!  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
That's right. Your powers will be halved.  
No hard feelings.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Urg. Even still, there's something I can do!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh no, Mash... I'll just have to fight harder!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
(Panting)  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Whoa, you guys are pretty good.  
Nice teamwork.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
You guys must be starting to synchronize after a few battles. The Shielder is a bit annoying too.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
I guess I should take one down.  
Which means...  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Time to use this!  
Gentle Bite Coinchenn!  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
No hard feelings, little girl.  
Medb wanted you for her army.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This familiar can even use a Noble Phantasm!?  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Yeah. Sorry, but I'm a thousand times stronger than I look. No need to brace yourself. You'll die instantly.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She wants Illya?  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Yeah. Seems she'd make the perfect vessel for her wishes.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
The more you desire, the more thirsty you become.  
That's greed. Now, sorry, but...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
I'm takin' you out.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Urg!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Mash!  
You protected us again...!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Oh? Illya, look over there!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ruby, we don't have time for... Hmm?  
  
   
**???:**  
Illya! Ruby! I'm sorry I'm late!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Yahoo! You're safe, Sapphire!☆  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Sapphire!? It's just you!?  
Oh, this is Miyu's stick, everyone!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But where's Miyu?  
  
  
---  
   
**Ruby:**   
Good timing, Sapphire! Make a temporary contract with Mash over there!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
She must be Illya's ally. Understood.  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Please excuse me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
My! I feel kind of strange.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Hm. You've become a lot like a magical girl all of a sudden.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
That means my fun ends here.  
I guess I'll retreat.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
You do that, Cú. And go tell Medb...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
That Illya already has two of the jewels.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Yeah, I could tell by the smell.  
There's one in your pocket too.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Got it. Sounds like a sweet situation Medb would be happy about.  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
First, please see this. It's a message from Miyu.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
(Panting)  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Miyu!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Ohh! (Sob) Miyu, what a humiliating position you are in!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
However, this bondage thing is somewhat sexy, like...  
Ack! Ow, ow, ow, I give up! I give up!  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Illya. Or to anyone who knows of Illya.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
I am Miyu... Edelfelt.  
I am a m-magical girl...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
(I guess Miyu is a little embarrassed too.)  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
I came to this world with Illya.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
I am a prisoner of the First Lady.  
It was she who created this Reality Marble.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Inside the black wall, located in the center of the Reality Marble, is the First Lady's castle.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Only one of her familiars can pass through the black wall.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Medb, the woman who attacked me and Illya, was also unable to penetrate the wall.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Queen Medb was eyeing Miyu from the beginning, too.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
The First Lady is probably the reason why we've been lured into this world.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
She seems to have found technology that could interfere with parallel universes.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
I don't think it's for a peaceful purpose.  
There must be a connection with why I'm held captive.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
We must do something. We must stop her plan.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
This castle is like a labyrinth of mirrors.  
The familiars have established a solid defense as well.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Still, I believe Sapphire will be able to escape and guide you here.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
But... if... it's you, Illya...  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Illya, you musn't come. Find someone to help you.  
Have them come instead.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
What!? What are you saying, Miyu!?  
Why do you always...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Now, now. It's just a recording.  
Calm down.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
The patrolling familiar is back!  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Sapphire, go now! And please be safe!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
... (Gloomy)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh no, Illya is extremely depressed...  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Illya. Miyu is waiting for you.  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Please don't be upset. I shall help as well.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Yeah, you're right. Thank you, Sapphire.  
I'm glad to see you again safe and sound.  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Yes. I should be with Miyu at all times, yet I returned alone. I truly regret this!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
And the ones from Chaldea. I don't know how to thank you for protecting Illya.  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Please, I beg you... Save Miyu!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
According to Sapphire, who sneaked inside the castle...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Even though Sapphire is away from Miyu, Miyu's transformation never lifted.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
The First Lady must have special powers over magical girls.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
This is dangerous! I am worried about Miyu too!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We can't overlook the First Lady's plan.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. Let's all go rescue Sapphire's Master, Illya's friend!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So the rival friend is the cool type, huh?  
   
**Ruby:**   
You sure know your magical girl stuff! With a clumsy and cute character, a cool and refined one is always needed!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
But with a secret fetish that's kept hidden underneath...  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Sister. No further.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Wait, what are you talking about?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
But... Hey, Sapphire... Why did Miyu say something like that?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That I shouldn't come...  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
I do not know either.  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
However, it seems that Miyu noticed something regarding the First Lady's true identity.  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
That was probably why she worried for you, Illya.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The First Lady's true identity?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do you know anything about it, Helena?  
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
...We've made a few guesses.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
The First Lady... The owner of this entire magical girl Reality Marble.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
She is said to be the very first magical girl.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Just as the King of Heroes originates the existences of the many other heroes who illuminate human history...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...so too was there someone who first defined the concept of “magical girl.”  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I have spoken with Medb about such things in the past.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Huh? Do you know, Ruby?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Uhhhhh... I just know that this is a dangerous topic!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
By that logic, we are just imitations that have been continuously copied...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
...so we would be at a great disadvantage in magecraft and the like!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Hehehehe, Ruby is getting fired up!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
That's my sister.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Haha. That's heartening, but I'm still worried.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
However...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is that the real reason Miyu tried to keep Illya away?  
  
   
## 4ier!!! The Land of Snow and Honey IV  
   
**Helena:**   
I'm staying here.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
She knows we're coming, so Medb will be waiting with everything she's got.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Helena.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
There's no making peace or compromising with Medb.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Defeat or be defeated, that's all there is with Medb.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I just... I don't want to see any more magical girls fall.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I understand!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Fujimaru, are you okay with that?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah. Thanks for taking us this far, Helena.  
  
  
---  
   
**Helena:**   
Wait, Illya. Take my jewel.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
You're already the owner.  
If you don't need it, bring it back to me.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I may have guided you here, but... you know.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I may not look it, but I care about my friends.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Yeah. I know that, of course!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Heheheh. I've been waiting, Illya.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
And the Chaldea Master and Servant, too.  
That's you, right?  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
...  
  
   
**Medb:**   
It was only for a moment, but I took a peek inside your world through the familiar I sent.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
It was so boring! So boring!  
Such a stupid world!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Why not forget that world and come join me?  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Or are you that stupid as well? Do you want to die drunk on your own self-satisfaction?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash, calm down.  
   
**Mash:**   
But...  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Heheh. You're always like a little puppy in heat, aren't you? Demi-Servant of Chaldea.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't talk about my friends like that!  
   
**Mash:**   
...That's right!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's true that Master Fujimaru positivity sometimes leads us into death-defying situations...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, that's not what I meant to say!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Our Order isn't just about our own self-satisfaction!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
And that's where you're wrong. You're arrogant enough to think you can save the world all by yourselves.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
You just want an excuse. You just want to say that you tried to fight back. You'll never really rule your own fate.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Medb:**   
It's fine. In the end, you're just fake magical girls.  
You're not worthy of my army.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
The one I really want is you, Illya!  
Are you ready to join me?  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Those two are probably secretly trying to take over your world.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Medb... No.  
They're not like you!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Fujimaru would never do that!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Are you sure?  
  
   
**Medb:**   
They seem very interested in knowing what they could use you for.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Uhhhngh!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Heheh...  
  
   
**Medb:**   
You want to save your friend, right?  
Miyu, was it?  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Fine. I'll help you.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
But I want you and Miyu to both join me. We'll make this Chaldea pair our slaves.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
It's fine to be greedy about things that don't matter.  
But don't get too greedy when it counts, Medb.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Kill them. They're worthless to be slaves. They may not look it, but they're no different than Spartacus.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Oh, Mini Cú! Even shrunken down you're still so cold and cruel!♡  
  
   
**Medb:**   
But I'm not going to listen to you.  
I'm the queen. I decide who lives and who dies.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But Medb, aren't you obeying the First Lady?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Illya?  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Oh? I'm interested where you got that idea.  
I want you even more now.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Yes, that's right. I was. But things are different now.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
The First Lady's dream is my wish.  
Her pain is my suffering.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
The First Lady. The first one to fall into this world.  
The first curse.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
The black queen who brought light and guidance to this chaotic world. But she can't leave her castle. She can't leave this world.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
She's all alone... The poor little queen of black.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
But I no longer feel respect nor pity!  
I have begun my rebellion!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You figured out what she wanted...and took it?  
  
  
---  
   
**Medb:**   
That's right! I just granted her wish early.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
And look at the result. There are only a few magical girls left in this world.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Is that... Is that what the First Lady wanted?  
That's crazy!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
And Medb, you're imitating her! You're insane!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Heheh.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
So you're going to resist. That's alright. That's very good. It's faster to overcome you with force!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
I'll steal you for my own before the First Lady gets you!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Medb, you're not crazy.  
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master...  
  
   
**Medb:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Helena said it. You're fighting against despair.  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Then are you saying it's the world that's gone crazy?  
Is that it, Master?  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Hah! That's just self-righteous nonsense!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Or is this your way of begging for your life?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Are you trying to forgive a selfish person like her, who's caused so many problems?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Even if it wasn't Medb who kidnapped Miyu, she was the one who made it possible by attacking us!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
She's even trying to invade Chaldea, the place where you live!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Heheheh.  
Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's the First Lady who's at fault, not Medb.  
  
  
---  
   
**Medb:**   
Don't talk to me. Don't look at me. Don't touch me! Don't even breathe!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master...  
Gasp!  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Heh. You shouldn't try and ruin a girl's makeup.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
And Medb, don't get so ticked off. This is the Land of Snow, right? It just won't do for the queen to get all hot-headed.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Oh Mini Cú... That's exactly what I needed to hear...!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
But that doesn't matter right now!  
You used your magic without asking me, didn't you?  
  
   
**Medb:**   
You're going to destroy my castle!  
And you'll tire yourself out!  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Shut up. I'll throw cheese snacks at you.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Oh, kill me, Mini Cú! I love you!  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Yeah, once this mess is all over, I will.  
Your reward can wait till then.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Yay! Okay, I'll kill them! They'll be first! I will kill those up-to-no-gouda folks first!  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Gouda? Well, whatever. Just kill them.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry Illya. I just ticked her off more.  
   
**Illya:**   
You don't look like you're sorry at all!  
But we have to fight!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Those two make a good pair, huh?  
   
**Ruby:**   
Yeah, they're like a match made in heaven.  
Just like me and Illya!☆  
  
   
**Illya:**   
They seem more of a cheesy pair to me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master and I are just as...  
Never mind...!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Attack incoming! Help us, Sapphire!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Understood. This fight is for Miyu!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
I'm gonna fight too, okay?  
  
   
## World End Match: Connacht☆Medb  
   
**Medb:**   
Gyah! I can't lose to that pink one!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You're the one who's pink!  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
...Sheesh. You lost because you wasted time on cheesy jokes, idiot.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
It's not like you to be careful and orderly with your invasions. Normally you would've just dove right into the main dish from the get-go.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
You had just a little bit of sympathy for the fates of your fellow magical girls, and that's why you lost, Medb.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Tch! Don't be stupid! That's too much, even coming from you, my lovely Mini Cú...!  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Huh? Normally I'm your enemy. Our relationship was as that we'd hang out together as enemies.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
T-That's true, but! I mean, you've always showed me a mix of love and hate!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
But there was always more love than hate!  
I mean, your mean-spiritness was always so cool!  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Right, whatever. You're weird.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Anyway, take back what you said a minute ago!  
I'm a queen! I don't care about the other magical girls!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
I get saved, I get satisfied, I'm cute, and I'm the most important!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
That's why I made my army! That's the only reason I gathered up magical girls who had no place to go!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...  
  
   
**Medb:**   
What's with that look? Like you're seeing something strange... Who do you think you are!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
No, um... What you said just surprised me.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But I think that Mr. Mini Cú is right.  
Medb must have been a great queen.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Huh? What did you say?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Because of what you just said.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
“I get saved, I get satisfied, I'm cute, and I'm the most important!”  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I think that's also what Nursery and Medea wanted.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But you didn't say that you only wanted that for yourself.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You didn't say it aloud, but you saw the other magical girls who disappeared as comrades, didn't you?

**Fujimaru 1:**   
The castle's falling apart!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
And there's the straw that broke the camel's back. Thanks for finishing her off, little lady.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
What!?  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
That broke Medb's heart.  
The castle falling apart is proof of that.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Isn't that right, Medb? You realized your own weakness and this time, you really killed yourself.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
I'm sorry.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
But I'm not worthy of you, Mini Cú... I'll die and come back again...  
  
   
**Medb:**   
I'll come back as a magical girl who's more evil, more debauched, more wicked and even more amazing!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Wait for me until then, Mini Cú♡  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
If fate brings us together, maybe. Well, if that does happen, this time I'll kill you myself.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Hehe. That's right. That's our relationship, isn't it?  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Anyway, I guess it's time for me to leave the stage.  
For a villain, I think I lasted pretty long.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
You. Pig. The one from Chaldea.  
What was your name?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fujimaru.  
  
  
---  
   
**Medb:**   
Fujimaru. What a boring name.  
I don't want to remember it, so get lost.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Take that little puppy dog with you. Don't stay here.  
Go save your stupid world.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
See this out until the end.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Medb.  
Master! The castle's falling apart!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Everyone, please evacuate the castle.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Illya! What are you doing!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Medb, come with us!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
With Helena's help, we can heal you!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's right, Medb! Come with us!  
  
  
---  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
That won't work. She can't escape.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
This is backlash.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
She built up quite a tab forcibly interfering with other worlds, and now all that stress is coming back to her.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Trying to deny that is an insult to her. She played the villain knowing what she was getting into from the start.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
You can have her life and her heart, but you can't have her pride. Now get out of here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry, Medb.  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
They left, huh?  
Tch, I'm done for, too.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Medb, what little magical energy you had is gone now.  
  
   
**Medb:**   
...  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
I always wanted to ask.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
What's the happiest thing in the world to you?  
  
   
**Medb:**   
I already have it... Mini Cú...  
  
   
**Medb:**   
The greatest happiness a woman can have... is being next to the one they love... when they die.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
What? The hell did you say, Medb? Wake up.  
  
   
**Mini Cú:**   
Seriously? Wow. I guess in the very end, you won.  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
The castle has completely collapsed.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The jewel! It's in my hand...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I see. So Medb became an Echo.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Then someday, I'll see her in my library.  
Though I've never heard of her liking books.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Helena. Just as I promised, I'll give back your jewel.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Thank you.  
Oh, don't worry about Medb.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
She was more than willing to kill you.  
There's no need for pity.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
And Medb entrusted you with that jewel. Not to you, Illya, but to Mash.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
At last. We have all four jewels.  
Which means...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We can go inside the black wall?  
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
To the First Lady's kingdom...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The jewels... They're glowing brighter!  
  
   
## letztes: The Land of Stars and Crystals I  
   
**Mash:**   
The black wall is gone!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
At last, we can venture to the First Lady's kingdom.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'll take a look from above!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Thanks! Be careful!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Ho-hoh? So that's the First Lady's kingdom, huh?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
It's cold, like time itself is frozen.  
And there's a solitary castle in the middle...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
It's like the mind of a magical girl had taken form!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
What kind of mind is it?  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
The castle feels different from when I made my escape.  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
So not only did the wall come down, there was a change inside, too?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
A change? Hm? Something's flying towards us.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Is it... a bird?  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Huh? That's...!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I feel a great flow of magical energy...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
The magical energy that filled this world is gathering where the First Lady is.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Does she have a vessel capable of holding all that magical power?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, if we're on schedule, then now...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, Chaldea should be... there it is!  
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hey, you're all looking good!  
I was worried, but I'm glad you're safe!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? Where's Illya and Ruby?  
D-Don't tell me...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They're both fine. We also met up with Ruby's little sister, Sapphire.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, tell us what is happening there!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Little sister? A Mystic Code has a little sister?  
No, I can't think about it now. We're in a hurry.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I had a meeting with Da Vinci and we came up with an engineering solution.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That world is very dangerous.  
But we've become very involved with it.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
At this point, we're a part of this too.  
We can't just ignore it.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And personally, I can't just leave Illya when she needs help.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Does that mean Chaldea is going to provide us full operational support?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's right!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Of course, personally I'm extremely interested in that grotesque... I mean, strange world.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That space should normally be... hmm... I guess you could call it a dumping ground for thoughts and feelings.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
You don't need to be so careful with your words. Yes. This place is purgatory itself.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
This is a dumping ground for magical girls who dreamed an endless dream, and failed to reach it!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Brava! All right, no need to explain!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's not wonderful! Nothing is all right!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
No, this is good! It's very good!  
A magical girl is an extremely unstable being.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
They have overwhelming magical energy, and sometimes can use magecraft intuitively, and without the proper rituals.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But for those who lose their possibilities and give in to despair, their obsession becomes a flow of unformed magical energy.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
A stagnant pool forming in a chaotic waste dump.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The First Lady became the locus of those chaotic thoughts and feelings, and the Reality Marble formed mostly on its own.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I assume that's about what happened.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Are you... a genius?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Of course I am. I apologize.  
I should've told you so earlier.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Then that means...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
If she disappears, everything will return to normal?  
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's right! That's what I'm after, you see!  
It's the best way to solve the root problem here.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But I don't know what that active magical girl with you will think. Or the residents of that world.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Man, you can be harsh. Though that may be the most realistic solution.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But let me say one thing.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You guys have done all kinds of things that I thought were impossible.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You can't make a miracle happen if you're worried about safety, efficiency, or a plan B.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If you've made it this far, you should do what you want to do.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm grateful, Doctor.  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Illya came back.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Fujimaru! The First Lady's familiars are coming! There are tons of them!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Ooh! This is an exciting situation! There's so many of them they're making the sky dark!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yup, let's do our best to save Miyu!  
   
**Illya:**   
Right!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's wrong, Helena?  
   
**Helena:**   
It's nothing.  
Come on, here they come!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I'll make a defensive wall to block their attacks.  
Fujimaru, you clear an opening.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
## letztes: The Land of Stars and Crystals II  
   
**Illya:**   
Schneiden!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
While we're busy battling them, more keep coming...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Shot, shot, shot!  
(Not at a place like this...)  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Feuer!  
(Not before I finish...)  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I can't stop here!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'll open a path in front of us! Ruby!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Okay, Illya!☆ Transferring all physical defense to firepower!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
FEUER!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Follow me! I'll guide you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let us handle the rear! We can't rely on the Doctor's scans beyond this point!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, right. We can't talk to him anymore, can we?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. That's what the Doctor and Da Vinci said.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Each time they communicate or do a Rayshift to this world, it establishes a Leyline.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So they cut off all normal communications and are on standby for our request to return home.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But the risk of hacking remains.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The other Servants should be defending Chaldea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But Chaldea is a delicate facility.  
We need to avoid any more attacks!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Right!  
  
  
---  
   
## letztes: The Land of Stars and Crystals III  
   
**Illya:**   
(Panting) This is the First Lady's domain...!?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
It's so shiny and sparkly that it gives you a feeling of security, like you've come home, you know?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
What do you mean, “come home!?” It's so smooth that it's hard to run!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That being said, if we flew, we'd be easy pickings for her familiars!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
True☆ And down here, the twinkling ground acts like a mirror, so good job!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Hey, d-don't look!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Illya, Ruby, this is no time for fooling around.  
Miyu is waiting for us.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
T-That's right! (Sweat)  
That must be the First Lady's castle!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
As we get closer to the castle, the sticks are shifting form... The familiars are getting stronger!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The First Lady is reacting to our presence, trying to keep us from coming closer.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
So she's been playing hide-and-seek behind the black wall all this time... Is she shy?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Or maybe she's in a hurry to try something?  
   
**Helena:**   
Yes. It has something to do with the jewels we've been gathering. That's my guess.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You mean it was the First Lady herself who disengaged the black wall? Not the power of the four jewels?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Does that mean she has been intentionally pitting the magical girls against each other from this isolated space?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
It's contradictory. As if two wills are at war with each other.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Either way, to learn her true motive, we'll just have to ask the First Lady herself.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe she doesn't actually want to fight Illya...  
   
**Illya:**   
And remember what Miyu said at the end of the message... That I should stay away...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I have a really bad feeling about this...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Oh, Illya, you get it, don't you?  
Wink-wink, nudge-nudge☆  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Knock it off!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Fujimaru! Illya! Enemy ambush!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Agh! There are so many of them!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
I'm so sorry! This is my fault for being a careless guide.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ungh! Getting into a drawn-out battle here isn't a good idea! If our pursuers catch up, it could prove fatal!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Go on ahead, Illya!  
  
  
---  
   
**Ruby:**   
What a good idea! If Illya makes a break for it alone, she'll get right through!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I could... never do that!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ruby! Sapphire! Give me your power!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I can't use my Class Cards right now, so I can't come up with a strategy that targets the enemy's weakness!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'll hold them off here, so the rest of you can go on ahead!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
That won't do, Illya! You wouldn't be able to get to Miyu on your own!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master! What should we do?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Draw out the battle here? It's our only option!  
   
**Mash:**   
Right! We'll just have to be very careful!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Helena, can't you fight?  
   
**Helena:**   
You're asking that from a simple mage with wafer-thin armor who's only just keeping up a protective wall for you?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Though you did see through my lie at the neutral zone. That's right. Right now, I have my own stone, so I can fight to some extent.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Still, I'm not your Servant.  
I'm here as a magical girl and that's all.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
So... I'll make my own judgment about you.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Illya:**   
(Panting) Still... so far to go... Ugh...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Pull yourself together, Illya. (Spank)  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Eeeek, my behind! Helena!?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I have a confession to make, Illya.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I'm surprised by how much spirit you've shown.  
Before, I looked down on you as a fake magical girl.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Tradition, experience, knowledge... It's far from those secrets of magecraft, but I realize again just how much power you have.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
(Panting) Huh?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
It's coming.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
By the wisdom of Serapis!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The enemies are... Uh Helena, what is that form?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Cool!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I've always been cool.  
I just have low blood pressure.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Now go, Fujimaru.  
Go with Illya to see the First Lady!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Those familiars are targeting magical girls. So I'll...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay. Please stay safe.  
   
**Helena:**   
Thank you, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
If we ever get the chance, I'll tell you my story.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Helena, are you...?  
   
**Helena:**   
In your eyes, do you see me as a Servant?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
But I'm a magical girl from a certain parallel world.  
I'm a mere apparition.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I'm a half-baked magical girl who couldn't become someone's hope, or even an Echo.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Therefore, like you said, at least let me have the spotlight for this scene.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
Helena!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Don't waste the time I've given you.  
Hurry up and go!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
I am in your debt, Helena.  
Come, Illya and everyone! Quickly!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I finally managed to drive them off.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Oh, I forgot to tell them. Well, to be honest, I didn't want to tell them.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
For Illya and the others to return to their original world, they need the jewels.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I'm not going to give them my stone, but as long as Illya and Miyu have two, it should be plenty.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Medb accidentally proved that. I finally understand the meaning of that accursed stone...  
  
   
**???:**  
Are you talking to yourself?  
Or is that a prayer, Helena?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Al. I didn't intend to summon you.  
  
   
**Mini Edison:**   
As long as you fight without abandoning your spirit of inquiry, I will stay by your side. I told you that once.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...So you did.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Xa xa xa! We're both old, so we better not overdo it.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Not to mention, your prized DC is thoroughly rusty.  
  
   
**Mini Edison:**   
Don't compare me with any AC stuff! DC is eternal!  
  
   
**Mini Edison:**   
My role is to support your activities, invest in you, and be happy about it! Now is the time to open your mystic grimoire!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Yes, let's do it.  
Come and get me, familiars of The First Lady!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Lemuria slumbers in the seas! Hierarchy graces the skies! And I stand upon the earth!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Meet the Magical Girl Guru, Mahatma♀Helena!

**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's pretty sparse inside the castle.  
   
**Mash:**   
But the structure is complex.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We would be totally lost if Sapphire weren't here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And they've stopped pursuing us. Helena...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm worried about Helena.  
   
**Illya:**   
I-I should probably go back!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right now, let's carry out our own mission.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Helena is strong, so she'll be fine. The same goes for Nursery and Medea...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You're right, Mash. After all, Miyu is waiting!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's pretty sparse inside the castle.  
   
**Mash:**   
True. But the structure is complex.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We would be totally lost if Sapphire weren't here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And they've stopped pursuing us. Helena...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm worried about Helena.  
   
**Illya:**   
I-I should probably go back!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right now, let's carry out our own mission.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Helena is strong, so she'll be fine. The same goes for Nursery and Medea...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You're right, Mash. After all, Miyu is waiting!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
Finally. I'll finally be able to see Miyu!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
We just have to go through the final corridor!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Someone's sitting on the throne!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
That's the First Lady... Ah!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
What's this?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Huh...? You're...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
&ndash;Chloe!?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Shoot, you made it, huh?  
You really don't know when to give up.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Chloe!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
C-Chloe, what are you doing here!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's Chloe? You did mention she was like a twin, but she really is the spitting image of you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is she a magical girl, too!?  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Yes. But why didn't I sense Chloe's presence?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
(Sigh) You've caused me so much trouble. I wish you would be a little more considerate, knowing that we share pain.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh, sorry. Wait a minute!  
Where's Miyu!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I get it, you came here to rescue her, didn't you, Chloe? Where are Rin and Luvia?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
No, they're not here.  
It's just me and Miyu.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
We've been here a long, long time.  
But I've been here since the beginning.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Huh? What are you talking about, Chloe?  
You've been here for a long, long time?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Where is Miyu?  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Over there! But be careful!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Miyu!  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash, check her condition!  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Roger that. What's this!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Part of Miyu's restraints are transforming...!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Chloe:**   
It's a defensive reaction of the Voile de Deuil.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
It's an Anti-Magical Girl Mystic Code.  
Even you wouldn't escape unscathed, Mash.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
What, an Anti-Magical Girl Mystic Code!?  
That's impossible! It's way too niche!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You're one to talk, Ruby, you cheerful-type something-something spirit... But never mind that now!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
What's going on, Chloe? If it's a joke, it's gone too far! Release Miyu right now!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Oh, what should I do? I mean, I went to all the trouble of making her mine.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
It used to be so annoying how you would always monopolize her, Illya.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Heh... This feels nostalgic. Yes. Maybe this is closer to my true self.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Illya? Is Chloe being controlled by the First Lady?  
   
**Illya:**   
Ulp... She could be. But she seems to be acting pretty naturally to me...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Chloe always did love pranks like this...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
I'm not picking up any strange magical energy.  
This is the normal Chloe.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How did she get her supply of magical energy?  
   
**Illya:**   
Ah! That's right! If she was controlling those familiars, it would've taken a lot of...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, Illya... Miyu's magical energy... Could it be being harvested?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Huh? Ah, yes... It's possible.  
That's why Miyu is tied up like that!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'm a little jeal... No! I mean, that's terrible harassment!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
My apologies for butting in. I don't think that's what Fujimaru meant...  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
You don't find it questionable that Chloe isn't draining magical energy from us magical sticks?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
My mind immediately went there? Aughhh!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I'm sorry, Master! I went off the rails!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Chloe:**   
Whew... You people certainly are noisy...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I don't want you getting the wrong idea, so let me dispel your doubts.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Illya, when you and Miyu went to the Mirror World...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I was actually with you.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
You two were in a hurry to get something there, so it seems you didn't notice my presence.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Flustered, I did a little tuning and jumped into the Reality Marble. In retrospect, that probably wasn't a good idea.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
The next thing I knew, I was in this world.  
And all alone.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You were here... before us?  
In this world?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
That's right. Ever since, I've been alone here.  
Like a time warp from the unstable jump?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
When I looked out over this world, I saw magical girls at war with each other, and I didn't know which were allies.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Even just concealing my presence consumed more and more of my magical energy.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
It got to the point where I almost disappeared.  
And I was very... lonely.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
But then I met Her.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You mean the First Lady...?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Her familiar, to be precise.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Illya?  
   
**Illya:**   
Wha...!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You were that reckless!?  
Chloe, you dummy!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Huh? How about you two? The ones who set off for the Mirror World without even telling me!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But we had an errand to do for Rin and we were in a hurry.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Chloe, we're from Chaldea.  
   
**Chloe:**   
Stop. There's no need for introductions.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
You're Fujimaru and Mash.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I've gathered what's going on, more or less, through Illya's senses. So I know your circumstances as well.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Then why didn't you join us, Chloe?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
That was because...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Chloe:**   
Because I was hoping that Rin or Luvia would come and save us.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
But since they didn't notice I was gone in the first place, of course they didn't come to save me.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
But...that wasn't it. My appearance in this world was inevitable.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
The First Lady told me something. She was brutally honest. It was like a knife sliding through my ribs.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
“Is the meaning of your life to be an accessory to Illya? You're like a wildcat that's been declawed.” That's what she said.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That's not...!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Yes, yes, I know. You deny it. Of course.  
You're Illya.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
More importantly, I don't see it that way, either.  
That being said...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I did realize that some part of me thinks of you as “number one.”  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
After all, I would even be friendly with Miyu for your sake. It's for my sake, too, so it's only natural.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Chloe...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master... Chloe's mood is shifting...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Eeeek! MG Power just shot up! How many transformations does she have left!?  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
But we still don't have an opening.  
We need to somehow get to Miyu.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Servility and trust are two different things, Chloe.  
   
**Chloe:**   
I know that! I know the essence of the world is how unfair it is!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
And I know that you're an extremely decent person, so much that being sarcastic to you makes me feel like a fool!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Tanned skin and pale eyes are great charm points!  
   
**Chloe:**   
Wha... Huh!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
T-That's right! Beautiful tanned...  
That's not the point!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Chloe, I'm the one who idolizes you! You're strong and have your act together infinitely more than me!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
That's not what I'm talking about. I don't think you'll ever be able to understand it, Illya.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Chloe:**   
But even I have a wish that I want to come true.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
For my sake alone. My own wish that would reach the world.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Chloe is... projecting a weapon!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Oh my. This is definitely battle mode, isn't it?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh, Chloe, how could you!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Fujimaru, Mash, and Sapphire too, please!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Please give me just a little time!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
T-Take it easy, though.  
   
**Mash:**   
If that's your wish, Illya.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This is a sisterly fight, right? Knock yourself out!  
   
**Mash:**   
A full throttle magic combat with the sisters' supremacy on the line... I'm kind of captiva... N-No!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If it becomes dangerous, I'm going to stop you both!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
Thank you.  
Ruby!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Yes☆ Can I punch the mischievous Chloe once?  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Come on, there's not a moment to lose.  
Let's just use my brainwashing device...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
No! I'm going to turn off the switch that made her weird!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Yeah, yeah☆ Beat her with your conviction, right?  
I know full well what you're going to do!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
But I also think you should apologize to her later for neglecting her.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ulp...  
Any way, get away from Miyu, Chloe!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Forget it! Miyu is mine now!  
  
   
## World End Match: First Lady  
   
**Chloe:**   
(Panting)  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I guess it's hard for us to have a decisive showdown, Illya...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
There's a limit to how much I can bear my shared pain with you.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Chloe!? What's wrong? Your body...!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Isn't it obvious? It's the First Lady.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
She doesn't just want Miyu. She wants you, too.  
Who knew there was someone greedier than me.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
W-What are you talking about, Chloe!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Chloe. It was the First Lady's idea to abduct Miyu, wasn't it?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I'm not...sure about that...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Chloe? Chloe!?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Unhhh... Wait, not yet... Stop... it...!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
As promised... I waited until after your duel with Illya, Chloe.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
As a vessel, you are impeccable.  
However, it seems you fall short of Illya's heart.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Chloe's body... Even her voice has changed completely!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The First Lady...!?  
  
  
---  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
That's right. It's a pleasure to meet you.  
I am the First Lady. The first magical girl.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Shall I introduce myself further? Perhaps in an amiable, courteous way, as befits a magical girl?  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
I was born in the Demon World, but raised in the human world.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
I hid my identity and fought for people. But because of that, I lost my homeland and was forgotten by both humans and my brethren in the Demon World.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Now no one knows who I am. There is no longer anyone around who will call my name.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
But I didn't hate humans or my brethren. I definitely didn't sink to the level of becoming a witch.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Right now, my only desire is to keep making girls' wishes come true.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
I want to spread the magic of magical girls... of love and hope... throughout the world.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Those feelings attracted Echoes to this Reality Marble.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you an Echo?  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Yes. Until Chloe came here, I suppose my existence was ephemeral like that.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
To form and sustain this Reality Marble, I needed to have an invisible presence.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
I gave the girls temporary bodies and magical energy to act as materials for them to create towns, castles, and kingdoms in this world.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
But it wasn't the same. To really make my wish come true, I needed a real magical girl. That's where Chloe came in.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why did you set the magical girls on each other?  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Ah... I regret that.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.  
It's too late now, though.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
There's not enough space! This Reality Marble isn't big enough for all of us.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
That's why I won't let you interfere.  
We need another world!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Why did you need Chloe?  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Why did Chloe appear before me?  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
It doesn't matter. That's not the issue. I have no intention of letting this opportunity get away from me.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Yes Mash, that's why I reached out to you as well, an employee of Chaldea.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
With Miyu, I can do it. I can give all of the Echoes new incarnations.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
And not inside this empty cage that is this Reality Marble, but in the real world.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Infinite parallel worlds host infinite crises. That's where you'll find real enemies who need to be defeated.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
There are miserable people who sincerely need magical girls!!  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Hence the Little Witch Codes... Nay, Prisma Codes!  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
We'll race to even the farthest parallel worlds!  
Because my wish will come true!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
This is...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Just like Medb... No, this is different... It's more evil... Darker...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Exactly. And she still tells herself that the means justify the end.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Illya... You would deny me my one and only, non-negotiable wish.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
After seeing the way you behaved towards the magical girls of this world, I finally realized that.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
I will allow no interference.  
Soon, I will absorb Miyu.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Miyu is a stubborn one. And Chloe, who's already a part of me, resists assimilation even now. She is a truly disobedient girl.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Even so, it's only a matter of time.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ms. Lady...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I can tell that you believe in the magical girls.  
But there's one thing I know.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
No wish is worth sacrificing Miyu!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
And not only Miyu! Chloe, too.  
Chloe is my precious other half!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's right! A selfish wish like that will never come true.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Is it because I'm an Echo? Nothing more than an echo that doesn't resonate within anyone's heart?  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
You'll forget me too, won't you?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I have no intention of consoling you.  
   
**Illya:**   
Fujimaru...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I can't go that far in rejecting The First Lady...  
I can't repudiate her...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Deep down, everyone has their own magical girl.  
   
**Illya:**   
How could you say a crazy line like that with a straight face!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
B-but that sounds a little... like you are trying to cheer up the First Lady!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Illya:**   
Ms. Lady, you are my Senpai as a magical girl, and a major Senpai at that.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But that's even more reason for not being able to overlook this. If you're making a mistake, I have to tell you so.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Heeheeheehee.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
The same thing. Chloe told me the same thing.  
And now you too!  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Do you really want to consign me to the past that badly?  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
When I can save the world... When I can become queen...  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Illya, eventually, so could you.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Listen to me, First Lady! Your wish would only turn into a curse!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
We magical girls are always getting involved in half-baked, outrageous trouble.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But even so, there are good things...  
Wait? ...Were there good things? Um...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Excuse me, Illya? At this point, you should be completely candid.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ah, t-that's right! There are moments where I thought it was a good thing!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I got to meet Miyu, whom I just love. And with Chloe,  
I got a sassy yet dependable little sister.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
With Ruby, Sapphire, Rin, and Luvia, I had reservations at first...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...but they've become dear friends for whom I could give up everything.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That's the best treasure of all, isn't it?  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
I had friends, too. But the world abandoned me.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Fujimaru, what about you?  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
I suspect you actually want to be forgotten. Perhaps that's the kind of person you are.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
But... what would you do if you could save the world?  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Right now, it's tougher and more painful than ever before and you want to run away, but you're still alive, right?  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
The moment you save the world, you would die.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
And Mash Kyrielight, what about you?  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Will your bond with Fujimaru last forever?  
Really?  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Would you be able to endure if you were abandoned?  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
If you could be with your Master for eternity, would you cling to that hope?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No. That isn't hope.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ms. Lady, you're very hurt.  
No one was able to heal or protect you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You've fought cruel destiny all this time, haven't you?  
I respect you. I definitely don't pity you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's a miracle that you and I met. I won't forget you.  
Even if you forget me.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Ah... You... lie... That's ...a lie!  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
... Ill... ya...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Miyu! You've come to!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Miyu!  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Help... The First Lady... Help Chloe...  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Her words... are false... She's hiding a wish... that won't come true deep in her heart...  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Please... She's crying on the inside. Take her hand... Just as Illya... Just as you did for me...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Okay. Hold on just a little longer, Miyu!  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Also... um...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Huh? W-What?  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Being with Chloe all this time... It's been awkward...  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
I mean, not knowing what to talk about... But silence is... painful...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
Excuse me, what was that!? When I'm doing everything I can in here to fight her!!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh, Chloe's back.  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
I tried to be on my best behavior with you! So if you've got something to say about me, say it to my face! Oh, you're such a pain!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
D-Don't, Chloe!  
If you show hatred towards Miyu.  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
Oh, shoot...! Come on... Illya, do something!  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Ah... I'm... sorry...  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Heh... Heh-heh...  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
By seeking out Miyu, Chloe and I have become one.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Thanks to that, I've broken through Chloe's mental wall. Now I can fight with all my might in this body!  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Once I defeat all of you in front of Miyu, her last emotional support will crumble, and I will reach infinite worlds!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
And then, when you get to those worlds, what are you going to sacrifice next?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
After all, Miyu's fighting you.  
And I can't lose!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Because the magical girls of Kaleid are two people in one!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
That's right! Now I'm moved, too!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Illya, everyone, please!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Fujimaru! Mash!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Please, just one more time! Let's fight together!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash. Mash Kyrielight.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master. Our feelings are one.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
For the longest time, I wondered why I wanted to become Illya's ally... but now I know.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Nursery and Medea, too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Despite wielding amazing power and beset by their own despair, they refused to walk away.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Every time, I felt choked up. I thought to myself,  
“are magical girls really that sad?”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But Illya didn't give up. Even if her wish was immature, there was nothing to be ashamed of!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, we'll side with those that persevere.  
   
**Illya:**   
Fujimaru...  
Thankyou...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Mash and Fujimaru, you're both the best!  
I will always be grateful, too!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Have you learned something about strength from Illya?  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
With magical girls, I'm sure they don't get all of their strength from using magic!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Illya. This is my fight now, too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's get Chloe and Miyu out of here!  
And then we'll help the First Lady, too.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Okay! Thank you!  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
I'm going to chant magic words.  
  
   
**E：First Lady:**   
Words for the unhappy, unfulfilled worlds beyond the reflective pathways of dimensions!  
  
   
## epilog: The Windflower Blooming in the Breeze  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
Ugh...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
(Panting) We wore her down... right?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Are you the First Lady now? Or Chloe?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Hmm? Looks like Chloe's got the advantage.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
The First Lady's response is disappearing from within her!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
What!? W-Wait a second, Ms. Lady!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Can you hear me, Chloe!? Please!  
Just hang in there a little more!  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
Don't say it like it's nothing... It's not that easy...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If Da Vinci and Master's theories are correct...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
When the First Lady disappears, the Reality Marble will vanish too... That means we're running out of time!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
I've confirmed that the binding Mystic Code has been released! Miyu!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash, take care of Miyu!  
   
**Mash:**   
Right! I'll help her immediately!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Miyu, can you stand? Please grab on to me.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Yes, I'm fine... but... Let me hold onto your arm for a moment, Mash.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Never said it but actually prefers Miyu) You okay, Miyu?  
   
**Miyu:**   
Yes. Thank you for helping Illya.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
I'm fine now. Now please, go to her... Help Chloe...  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Um... I'm fine.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
I'm fine, really. You can put me down now...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Miyu:**   
Whew. Thank you too, Sapphire.  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Miyu...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'm so glad, Miyu...  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
What is the big idea, Illya?  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
If you don't finish me off... You won't win.  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
I'll never give up... I can't give up...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
It's not about winning or losing, Ms. Lady.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
That's right. It's not.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
What you're doing isn't about obsession, or ideals.  
It's about atonement.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
First Lady, you just can't accept it.  
What you have is different from Illya's pure feelings.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
M-Miyu...  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Illya, tell her how you feel.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
What? Me!?  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Yes. Tell her everything. Honestly.  
So that it will reach her heart.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Got it, Miyu.  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ms. Lady... I-I...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'm always so busy dealing with what's going on around me... So I've never thought about saving the world...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
No, to be honest, I forced myself to think it had nothing to do with me because things were far away.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But if I was in your place, Ms. Lady...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
If I had such an incredible power that it became my duty to help people who relied on me...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I wouldn't know what I'd do... Or who I would chose.  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
...I see.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
But, if my friends and family that I love were in danger, I'd use my magic without hesitation.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I'd use my magic to protect everyone's smiles.  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
Even if it meant that you yourself had to cry?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...(Nod)  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
Illya... I'm jealous of you.  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
But at the same time, I think you're foolish.  
It's like looking at the old me.  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
I couldn't save... the friend I cared about...  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
I had to choose between her and the world and I chose...the world.  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
I couldn't save... my best... friend...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's...  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You sacrificed... your friend?  
Was she a magical girl, too?  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
...No.  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
She refused to be a magical girl. She became an enemy of the world, and brought despair to everyone.  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
That's why I... I had to stop her... myself...  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
I'll never see her again... I couldn't tell her... that I was sorry!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I don't know about that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Helena!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Helena! And Mr. Lion, too!?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Yes. I unfortunately survived. Just like the First Lady? No, that's not right.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Not only did I fail to become something, I failed to die, too. I really fail at everything, don't I?  
  
   
**Mini Edison:**   
Don't worry, self-deprecation is a habit of hers.  
Just ignore her.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Al...! Keep your mouth shut...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
When your battle started for real, the First Lady's familiars ceased to be a threat.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
It was tough just getting to this throne room.  
The barriers on this castle are too strong, and she can't get in.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
If Miyu's okay, let's take the First Lady and go outside.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
While we move, can you tell me about the girl the First Lady is possessing?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Of course, but who is “she”?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Eeee...!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Are you that ghost from before?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What are you doing here?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
This Echo is probably the one that was often wandering around the black wall.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
After the wall fell, I found her heading for the castle.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Wait a minute, First Lady, do you know her?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
She looks like she wants to say something to you.  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
...  
  
   
**Echo:**   
...!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
It looks like she's really mad.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
She trying to tell the First Lady something?  
But I don't know what she's saying!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ruby, can't you do something?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Just leave it to me! Try my special ghost medium potion! Here! (Stab)    
   
**Illya:**   
Oooh!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She didn't even ask for permission!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Did the ghost really posess her? That was easy. I know it's redundant to say it, but that Mystic Code has some crazy functions.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Well... Illya? I mean, Ghost?  
  
   
**First Lady:**   
...  
  
   
**???:**  
...ou...  
  
   
**???:**  
...You...  
  
   
**???:**  
You... dummy!  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
Oww...She just hit me! What was that for...?  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
Ow! That really hurt...!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Oh-ho? The defensive response brought Chloe halfway back.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who are you?  
  
  
---  
   
**Miyu:**   
The girl possessing Illya...  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
I may know her. If she's the girl from my dream...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Your dream?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
But it just looks like Illya and Chloe are brawling.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um, Illya?  
  
  
---  
   
**A：???/Illya:**   
I'm calling you a dummy because you're a dummy!  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
The way you're talking...  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
Mila? Is that you!?  
Are you one of the Echoes here?  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
Yes, got a problem with that?  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
It was only for a short while, but I was a magical girl. That's why I have the right to be here.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
And right now, you're the First Lady.  
The first magical girl. Right?  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
It is her.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Mila? Are you the First Lady's special friend?  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
That's right, Miyu.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
I am a former magical girl who was slain by the First Lady.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Wait, that means you were the first corrupted magical girl.  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Sister, be quiet.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
First Lady... You did your best as a magical girl.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
You gave everything you had to the world so that everyone could be happy.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
But the harder you worked, the more people's smiles disappeared.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
You were worn down by their greed and dissatisfaction, until you were crying even as you smiled.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
I didn't think that world was worth saving.  
I chose you, not the world.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mila...  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
Were you here the whole time, Mila?  
And I just didn't notice?  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
That's right. I'm just a shadowy Echo.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
Without borrowing Illya's body, I can't maintain my consciousness.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
But I always felt your presence, because this world is the manifestation of your regrets.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
That's why I always wished I could go beyond the black wall, so that I could bring peace to your heart.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Mila, you were the one who opened a Leyline outside the Reality Marble!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
It wasn't a coincidence that summoned Chloe to this world. Mila, it was your wish.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
I'm not aware of that, but... If I did, I apologize.  
I caused you a lot of trouble.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
T-Then what about my sleepwalking at Chaldea?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That was probably Medb.  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
Yes. That was her doing.  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
For a very brief moment, Medb's power rivaled mine.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Was that the First Lady's doing too?  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
No, that was Medb.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
Medb used her vast magical energy to open up a Leyline.  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
I just tried to use that opened Leyline.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see.  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
The pressure from the First Lady feels like it's about to disappear...  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
At this rate, no matter how much I hold back, she's going to be pushed out.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Helena, how are you doing?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I don't feel a change yet.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
But something's already happening in the Land of Dead Bookshelves. I can feel it through the jewel.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
The collapse is probably starting at the lands furthest from the First Lady's castle.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So the Reality Marble can't sustain itself after all...  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
Illya, Chloe, Miyu. I'm sorry for getting you caught up in the collapse of the Reality Marble.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
There has to be something we can do...!  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
No, I don't care what happens to me.  
But...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
First Lady, may I take over the Reality Marble from you?  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
The Reality Marble? Is that possible?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Unfortunately, I'm serious.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
This world is needed as a place for wounded magical girls to go.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
It's not a nice way to say it, but it's the same way you need a soldier's home for wounded soldiers.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
No, forget that example. It makes me think a dangerous antibacterial magical girl might show up.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Anyway. First Lady, in order to stop more girls from ending up like you...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...would you let me start over with your first wish?  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
...  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
Helena. Magical Girl of Wisdom and Mystics.  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
Yes. If that is your true wish, then... I will grant it!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Thank you, First Lady. I'll do it right this time.  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
The First Lady's magical energy is fading.  
So is Mila's...  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
Oh no... Mila's going to disappear.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
Listen, First Lady.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
You were abandoned and forgotten by the world.  
And you feel terribly betrayed.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
Magical girls aren't witches.  
And they aren't queens.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
They don't seek rewards for their miracles.  
They don't use magic for themselves.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
They just put the feelings that well up in their hearts into spells, for people that they will never know.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
Otherwise, their impossible wishes become curses.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
Their emotions get trapped in the gaps between worlds and turn into purgatory.  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
I still... And Mila, you...  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
No, First Lady.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
You've cast enough spells. You cast them until your throat went hoarse.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
You read the book of magic all the way to the last page.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
It's true that new dangers and new enemies will never stop threatening the people.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
But even so... That's why new magical girls, like Illya, are born.  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
They're still incomplete magical girls, and maybe you can't totally rely on them...  
  
   
**A：Mila/Illya:**   
But that's why, in their hands...  
  
   
**E：First Lady/Chloe:**   
...the future lies within them!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A new jewel appeared in Helena's hand...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Oh-ho? They're holding hands like lovers.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
But now you're both back to normal.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Y-Yeah. I'm fine. What about you, Chloe?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Ugh... where am I... who am I...?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I don't know... I can't remember any of the wicked things I've done... So you can't ask me to be responsible for them...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I think I forced Miyu to give me magical energy in a way that violated FCC standards, but it was consensual so that doesn't count.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
And no one knows that I used the First Lady's power to make a world where I was the star...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
...and lived a lovey-dovey life with my brother, but then I was accused by the ESRB army of justice, and I turned evil, and was defeated...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Anyway, a lot's happened, but well done, Illya!  
That's my heroic magical girl! I believed in you!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Whoa... I know it's not Chloe's fault, but I think she should be a little more repentant...  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
In a sense, she has the same MG Power as Illya, that lets her never doubt herself. Her alignment's chaotic, though.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Chloe, that's why you can never be the main character.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Hey! This is where you're supposed to say, “It must've been so hard for you, but you're still lovely”!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I worked hard too!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Don't you understand that it was only my iron-clad self-control that kept the First Lady in check?  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
That's... true. Chloe and the First Lady had a very high compatibility.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
It was only thanks to Chloe's strong mind that she was able to stop the First Lady from assimilating her completely.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Right? Right? My heart of justice isn't so bad, is it?♪  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I like fun things, mischief, my brother, and also being mean to the weak.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
But I hate sadness more than anything. That was the one thing the First Lady and I couldn't agree on.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
(Yeah. I understand how the First Lady feels.  
If she had possessed me...)  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
(I wouldn't have thought to hear someone out like that... She acts wicked, but Chloe had the same heart as Illya.)  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
(That's why it was Mila and Illya who saved her.  
And also Chloe, who played with her...)  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Am I imagining it, or is there a gentle look in Miyu's eyes? What? Do you see me in a new light or something?  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Not at all. I'm going to be billing you for the psychological pain I suffered, Edelfelt-style.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
That just means you want money!  
You Edelfelts really are obsessed with money!  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
That's only Luvia and Rin. Miyu has pure and proper ideas about finances.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Done making up? Then let's finish this.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I have the First Lady's jewel now.  
If I use it for myself, nothing would change, but...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
If I make a world where wishes can circulate, instead of a closed world for just one person...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I get it! So you just have to use the jewels for someone else's sake, huh?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Yes, that's right. You pick this stuff up fast.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
If you add in Nursery's and Medea's jewels, and the one from Mash, that's three of them!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
The magical energy is flowing through them equally, and now we can go back to our old world!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Um... Does that mean we each take a jewel?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Illya uses one for Miyu, Miyu uses one for me, and I use one for Illya.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
We all face the other person and wish that they'll be able to go home?  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Is it that easy? That seems too easy...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Don't think about it too hard!  
Let's just focus on going home, Miyu!  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Y-Yeah...  
If you say so, Illya...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Helena. Are you staying here?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
You're going to take the First Lady's place, and serve as host to the magical girls who come here?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Yes. I'll work to be the best I can.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I'm sure I can find Medb and Nursery's Echoes as well.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Also, Medea. If she'd stop being depressed and cheer up, she'd be good to have around.  
  
   
**Mini Edison:**   
Indeed. When you say you'll work at something, I know you're going to commit youself to it your whole life.  
  
   
**Mini Edison:**   
But this world is unstable.  
It will probably fall apart eventually.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Maybe. The end will come someday.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
And when it does, I'll go to some out-of-the-way world and live in a haunted house with the Echoes.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That... Hehe. That sounds kind of fun.  
Good luck.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Of course, Mash Kyrielight.  
Become a great magical girl, okay?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm a Demi-Servant!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Hahaha...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Fujimaru, Mash.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You are very nice people, so I was scared to bring it up, but...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You've been fighting for your world for a long time now. And risking your life.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I could tell from your conversation with Mr. Romani.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You have a far more important tasks than I do, but you saved me, Chloe, and Miyu anyway.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That's not something you could do on a whim.  
Look, Fujimaru is smiling like it's a joke again, though.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You're suffering more than anyone, but you can still offer help to others. That's a miracle that no magic could create.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Only someone like that can save the world.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Come on, Chloe. You've got something to say too, right?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I'm sorry for causing you trouble,  
Mash, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
You guys have it rough, but don't stress out too much.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You could be more polite, Chloe!  
Jeez...  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Fujimaru. I'm really grateful.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
I... I can't even imagine what kind of strong will you need to try and save the world.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
But you did all this for us anyway.  
I can really feel your warmth.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
You can work so hard to fight for others...  
I'm sure seeing you do that is what saves people.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
I'm sure that that's what gave this world meaning. That's... what I think.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're so mature, Miyu.  
   
**Miyu:**   
No, I'm a powerless child.  
I can't do anything on my own.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
I'm useless without Sapphire.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I don't care if you're a child or a grown-up.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
If I was going to take a student, I'd choose Miyu.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Those two probably can't even make a satisfactory cup of tea.  
  
   
**Illya & Chloe:**   
Aw...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You could probably be a little more selfish.  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right. It's not bad to say what you're really thinking.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
I'm fine.  
Now that I have Illya and Chloe with me.  
  
   
**Miyu:**   
Mash, do you ever ask Fujimaru for what you want?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? I-I...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'll do my best...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
And it doesn't count if you rely on alcohol.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ruby:**   
Are you ready, everyone? We'll be going first.  
  
   
**Sapphire:**   
Farewell, Helena, Mash, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I don't even know how to thank you... Someday I'll pay you back for this. (Bowing)  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
That would be impossible, Illya. You can barely handle your own problems.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Like what underwear won't look embarrassing if our brother sees it, or what pudding you'll have for a snack.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
W-What!? I'm not like you, Chloe! Jeez!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're fine as you are, Illya.  
   
**Illya:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. Illya, please just stay who you are.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That... that kind of hurts... (Sob)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'll meet again someday.  
   
**Mash:**   
You're right. Actually...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
When Illya said I looked like someone from her family, it made me feel so happy it almost hurt...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I wish I had a little sister like you, Illya...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Mash...

Forming limited dimensional reflection route!

Mirror World corridor at maximum deployment!☆ Initiating linkage search to normal world!☆  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Alright, time to jump!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Look at the jewel and envision the coordinates of your original world, okay?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Thank you, Helena&mdash;!  
And Mash! And Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Take care!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And the sealing's complete. Whew.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Leyline between us and that Reality Marble has naturally dissipated. Now there's no way to know what is happening there.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We can assume the danger of interference from a parallel world is gone.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Unless there's any other extraordinary Mystic Codes like Ruby and Sapphire who force their way into our world...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll deal with that when it happens.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hahh... You're right. We can just be optimistic, and treat this as a learning experience for dealing with irregularities.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It was a valuable experience for me too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We didn't spend as much time there as we did on our other missions, but it felt very long.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see... Anyway, I'm glad you're both safe.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Now that things have settled, I wanted to ask you something...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Who is... that?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Hmm?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Oh, I ended up here.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Chloe!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Chloe:**   
So this is Chaldea, huh? It's very modern.  
A little empty-looking, though.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Chloe... It's kind of weird that you're just accepting this situation...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
W-What's going on here!?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Hahaha. I'm a little surprised myself.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
While I was listening to Fujimaru and Mash, you see...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I thought to myself that your missions at Chaldea sounded kind of fun.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
And when I heard that I'd lose the chance to peek at what was going on here, I didn't want to miss it.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
This might be a little trick played by the First Lady. Maybe it's her way of paying me back for the use of my body? Something like that?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
T-This is a trick that's gone too far.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Can I assume you want to become a member of Chaldea?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Yes, I do. I'd love to.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you a Servant now? Or a magical girl?  
   
**Chloe:**   
Don't know. At least I don't think I'm a Heroic Spirit.  
I'm actually not much of a magical girl, either.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I see... Maybe that's why I was the only one who was summoned...?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Gotta make a list of who you can't be around!  
   
**Mash:**   
You're worried about that!?  
That makes me worried about you!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
What are you talking about? Don't worry. I'll be fine.  
I know there are all different types of Servants.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Chloe:**   
Anyway, I can tell that this facility's magical energy is keeping me alive. Wouldn't that make me a Magical Girl-Type Servant?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Now there's another strange category...  
I bet Da Vinci would love it, though...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
He's holding his head with his hands...  
I thought that only happens in manga.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
B-But Chloe? What about Illya and Miyu and the others?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Oh, that? Don't worry about that, Mash.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
The other me made it back to my old world with them.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
That's the one thing I know for sure.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Oh, right.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
In Chaldea, Fujimaru is the only mage and Master, right?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
So let me reintroduce myself to my official Master...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I am Chloe von Einzbern. I look forward to working with you, Master.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
But you really don't have the aura of a “Master.”  
How about “Fujimaru”?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Oh, right! Don't forget to replenish my magical energy!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, you can't!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
No fair! You can't have Master all to yourself! Being greedy is the first step towards being a corrupted magical girl!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
T-That's not the issue.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh boy. Looks like Fujimaru just got another headache to deal with...  
  
   
## The Land of Sweets EXTRA I  
   
**Illya:**   
Huh? Where are we...?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Oh-ho? I can feel it in the air, something story-irrelevant but ever so meta is coming!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Now that you mention it, something feels really happy-go-lucky around here. Shall we ask Doctor to investigate, Master?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
That won't be necessary, woof!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Sugar perks me up in the morning. For the brain.  
But I can't find any good sugar.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
And then you crash into me. You, a combination of kindness, sweetness, and sexiness; sweeter than honey.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Ah, it's like cat-nip to me! I'll take the pink cake!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Wh-What is that!?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
A wild WADARCO appears in a savage magical world!!  
Like a Servant, but not like a Servant...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is she... a magical girl, too?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's just nameless small fry.  
   
**Fake Tamamo Cat:**   
What the meow do you mean by small fry, woof!?  
  
   
**Fake Tamamo Cat:**   
There's no fish called small fry here!  
Big or small, the flavor is what matters, glug!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I can't keep up with these ever-changing sentence endings anymore!  
  
   
**Fake Tamamo Cat:**   
I never back down, never grovel, and never look back! But I also never miss the bumper in front of me!  
  
   
**Fake Tamamo Cat:**   
Well, the Catmobile only has two pedals: accelerate and jump.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Just a stray Cat. I'd bet Doctor's soul on that.  
   
**Fake Tamamo Cat:**   
Good! No good!  
Ohhhh, which is it? You are so smart!  
  
   
**Fake Tamamo Cat:**   
Either way, you need to retract that bet. Why? Who's that girl who's the talk of the Nine Tails industry?  
  
   
**Fake Tamamo Cat:**   
Who was cast in the role of “Genius Magical Girl” by the Tamamo Nine Conference? That's right... ME!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fake Tamamo Cat:**   
Hm, what I'm really trying to say is...  
  
   
**Fake Tamamo Cat:**   
I am the most powerful magical girl in the family Felidae. Fake is in my name, but you can ignore it.  
  
   
**Fake Tamamo Cat:**   
It's like, you know, the discount tag on a fish package at a supermarket right before closing.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Stare)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm getting an odd vibe from her. She's too consistent in her conversation to be the real Ms. Cat.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
W-what? Consistent? Really?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's try battling it.  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
It feels that that would be the best option.  
  
   
**Fake Tamamo Cat:**   
What, meow? Even though I said I'd take carrot cake instead?  
  
   
**Fake Tamamo Cat:**   
Everyone talks about Tamamo, Tamamo, Tamamo! Why doesn't anyone accept Cat!? And new animations while you're at it, please!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Fake Tamamo Cat:**   
Ugh... Splendid! I feel like something the cat dragged in...  
  
   
**Fake Tamamo Cat:**   
Come to think of it, meow...  
I don't get the concept of a magical girl...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
She turned into a stick and fell apart!?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
It appears that stick was doing its best impression of her.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
It was already breaking down, perhaps from the mental strain of that impression? Still, copying a humanoid form is impressive.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
I want that skill too!☆  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I can definitely say for sure that nothing good will come of it!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A fake magical girl rather than a fake Servant?  
  
  
---  
   
**Ruby:**   
It's possible, within this odd space!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At any rate, I'm relieved to know she wasn't a real Servant.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Aside from the fact that she was hostile towards us, we didn't really figure out anything.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's more on her than on us...  
   
**Mash:**   
It would be nice to have an enemy we can communicate with... Is that a strange thing to ask?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She did look kinda like a magical girl.  
   
**Illya:**   
Yes. It did feel like she was bursting with dreams.  
Just not hope.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Besides, her voice sounded familiar to me for some reason...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Oops, that's a meta-statement disguised as foreshadowing! If only Chloe was here, it would've been even more confusing.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ruby:**   
At any rate, I don't think that one was the last fake Servant...!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
We're going to run into more, huh...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Wait a minute. Isn't this detour up to Fujimaru?  
  
   
## The Land of Sweets EXTRA II  
   
**Fake Astolfo:**   
Whoa, you actually came!  
You guys look like monsters!  
  
   
**Fake Astolfo:**   
You have to deal with me now!  
Alright, I'll strum you a song on my horn!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
She popped in pleasantly, but...  
Why did she say “strum” to play a horn...?  
  
   
**Fake Astolfo:**   
Oh, just watch how I play it! (Rustling)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You don't have to show off your brand-new Noble Phantasm right here! Do you hear me, Fake-stolfo!?  
  
   
**Fake Astolfo:**   
Uh, yeah, I do have to!  
  
   
**Fake Astolfo:**   
Since I've been summoned into the “Magical Girl” class, promoting toys is my most important duty!  
  
   
**Fake Astolfo:**   
I am the very model of a magical girl, you know?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Y-Yes...you definitely are!  
Although it annoys me to admit it...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
And you even have that boyishness going for you...  
Altogether it's a little over the top...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Magical... girl?  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh, why are you looking at me like that?  
Did I say something wrong?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Um, Illya?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
If you dig too deep, you'll get yourself in an embarrassing situation. Boyish girls sometimes...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
(Gasp) I kind of get it now!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I completely agree. You're a perfect magical girl.  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai. I think it's courageous of you to speak with such conviction, but please be prudent now.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Illya's breathing became harsher. Any further and she'll descend into a place of madness!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Boyish... Magical Girl...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Th...th...those two concepts seem to be completely unrelated to each other, but I've come up with an idea!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Speaking of a boyish girl, what do you think would happen if Gil transformed!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
   
I might want to give it a try! Though it has really nothing to do with the situation right now... (heavy breathing)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's too late!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fake Astolfo:**   
My name has an unnecessary “Fake” stuck to it, but I don't care!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, anyway, can I ask one thing?  
Especially of you, Ruby.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Sure sure, what is it?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Have you changed your mind about becoming the ultimate Captain Magical Girl with your charming shield moves?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No. I couldn't leave Mr. Leonidas behind...  
No, that's not what I wanted to ask.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Does Fake-stolfo have any basis for calling himself a magical girl? Besides his usual “I just feel like it” thing.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
To be specific, it makes me wonder if my attacks will be effective in this Reality Marble!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Now that you mention it, I can feel strong MG Power from Fake-stolfo.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
But I predict that you are strong enough to confront him in your current state, Mash!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That statement slightly increases my complicated hopes and fears!  
  
   
**Fake Astolfo:**   
Hey, are you ready yet? Can I take a nap?  
C'mon, let's do it... I'm tired of waiting... Zzz...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh, I'm so sorry!  
You already look so sleepy!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I apologize, let's leave it at that. As long as I can be useful in the battle, I'll give it my best!  
  
   
**Fake Astolfo:**   
Really? Great! All right, I'll embrace you with my song!  
  
   
## The Land of Dragons and Sea EXTRA I  
   
**Fake Shuten-Douji:**   
Oh my, customers in an obscure place like this.  
  
   
**Fake Shuten-Douji:**   
I can still hear the regretful slosh from my little gourd, but... I suppose I have a job to do.  
  
   
**Fake Shuten-Douji:**   
Or, would you care to finish this with me?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Well if it isn't the headline act, oooh!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ruby is strangely excited again!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah. Let's take a break.  
   
**Mash:**   
Master? Please don't casually pull out your own wine cup.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We'd be playing right into Fake Shuten's hand.  
Don't drink and fight.  
  
   
**Fake Shuten-Douji:**   
Oh, you'll come on a pleasure cruise with me?  
...But you've got something scarier than a wine cup up your sleeve, don't you?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can't believe it! Magical Douji...!  
   
**Ruby:**   
Fantastic! A concept that defies the laws of physics!  
The most powerful synonym in the universe!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Y-you should stop right there!  
  
   
**Fake Shuten-Douji:**   
Oh don't say that. Others have their rules, and I have my own.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fake Shuten-Douji:**   
I don't think it's a good idea to shove any old thing up your sleeve...I should punish you for that, shouldn't I?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Her MG Power just skyrocketed!  
She may be a fake, but she's still strong!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Even before you mentioned it, her bloodlust was pretty obvious!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
And the smell of alcohol is starting to make me dizzy!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I can't drink alcohol, so would you mind if I just fill your cup?  
  
   
**Fake Shuten-Douji:**   
Hehehe... Don't be so cold, have some fun with me...  
  
   
**Fake Shuten-Douji:**   
We'll get drunk and call each other's names, and soon you'll find yourself in heaven... or in my little gourd?  
  
   
**Fake Shuten-Douji:**   
Will you dissolve to the bone for me?  
  
   
## The Land of Dragons and Sea EXTRA II  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Heh... Heheh!  
So you've finally come to me!  
  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Too long have I waited! I drown in monotony! My seat has twisted and my tiger skin loincloth has almost worn out!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh. Even Ibaraki has become a fake Servant!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
W-What a final boss-like aura she has!  
Who is she!?  
  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
(Pfft)  
  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Hah! Now, listen carefully!  
  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Born as an oni, so I meet my end;  
  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
My life shall be a bloody path of thorns.  
  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
A third-rate mage? Your arts I swallow whole,  
To be reborn as embers in my palm.  
  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
The madden'd roses bloom beneath my feet,  
And crimson blossoms cover Kyoto's streets!!  
  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Magical Douji! I☆BARA☆KI has arrived!  
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I☆BARA☆KI...(gulp) What a powerful impact...  
It's like graffiti drawn under a bridge.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Did we make it to the final boss already? What should we do, Fujimaru!? I'm not ready yet!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Running wild. As expected from a Berserker.  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
How could I put up this show of such pompous lines if I were in control!? Cower in fear, humans! (Sob)  
  
   
**Illya:**   
She's completely given up on herself!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wait, did she just say tiger skin loincloth?  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
That!? That is the part that catches your attention?!  
  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Whether it is tiger skin or leopard skin, what does it matter what I, the oni leader, wrap around my crotch!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
W-What shall we do, Master? She is convincing! I'm starting to wonder if she's really a Fake Servant or not.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
I think she's trying to express her fakeness through poetry?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I-I am not doing this because I want to...  
Shu... My boss insisted and...  
  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
She said that both me and my loincloth need to tighten up, so I had better plan out a proper magical girl character beforehand...  
  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Therefore, I stayed up all night to work on it! I nearly bit through my tongue rehearsing that introduction...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I-I see... You went through a lot. I understand.  
We all have a hard time with our bosses.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
My red oni maste...I mean, my evil teacher is always super bossy too.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
And it's always that boss who tends to be the one sidetracking things, you know.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
M-My Master is not like that...  
  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
(Irritated)  
  
   
**Illya:**   
W-Well, I mean mine isn't always like that either.  
I guess I over-exaggerated a little.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
She is sometimes nice... like five percent of the time... Hehe.  
  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
(Super irritated)  
  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
F-Fools! How dare you make fun of me in whispers!?  
  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
   
Grrr, if you are not going to be serious, leave!  
No, I'm leaving! I'm going back home to Mt. Ooe!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
M-Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Please, let me fight you!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What a coldblooded, fearsome banana oni!  
  
  
---  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Hahahaha! That's more like it!  
  
   
**Fake Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Now, come! I shall eat you down to the very last bone!

**Fake Okita:**   
Cough!! (Blood)  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Coughing blood!?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Hey, who chose this tuberculosis patient!? It's repetitive! We just got her voice with Shuten!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
What are you on about!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fake Okita, you're a magical girl too?  
  
  
---  
   
**Fake Okita:**   
I see. The real magical girls of this magical girl world?  
  
   
**Fake Okita:**   
Well, that is because I thought I could slice and dice... Never mind.  
  
   
**Fake Okita:**   
Even in a late-stage magical girl world like this, someone has to take a stand and save it.  
  
   
**Fake Okita:**   
And I have responded to the call.  
Take a good look, world! I am the MIBU WOLF!  
  
   
**Fake Okita:**   
Which means I have awakened to the magical girl vibes, becoming First Unit Captain of the Magical Shinsengumi.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
What? A Shinsengumi Magical Girl!?  
That's so old, it's new!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
It smells like a business opportunity for figurine sales. Ruby is getting excited now!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
You think so? Wasn't there someone like that in Bushido Musashi's side quest?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What is this feeling...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
When Fake Okita and Ruby are facing each other like this...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It feels like my EXP is going to go up a lot... (Gulp)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But, oh? Fake Okita's shaking?  
  
   
**Fake Okita:**   
Yes. That's how it was supposed to be...  
But what is this about!? A fake Servant!?  
  
   
**Fake Okita:**   
It's like a cheap version of a Shadow Servant (Shadvant for short)! This is not what I signed up for!  
  
   
**Fake Okita:**   
Fancy extra CG for my costume! New voices added! Where did they all go!? (Click)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fake Okita is in battou-jutsu stance!  
She's serious!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Shall it be a duel, then?  
   
**Fake Okita:**   
I am sure that was your intent in the first place.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Why does it always turn out like this!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Magical girls fighting... What a sad world this is...  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, Master, you aren't very convincing if you're watching with those gleaming eyes.  
  
   
**Fake Okita:**   
I do not mind. I can tell your fighting spirit is more than sufficient.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Magical girls fighting...  
Wait, what about my say in this!?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fake Okita:**   
In these turbulent times, it is luck that determines friend or foe. A cruel twist of fate, common in collab events...  
  
   
**Fake Okita:**   
Fake Okita Souji, someone completely unrelated to the First Unit Captain of the Shinsengumi! Here I come!

**Fake Nobunaga:**   
It is me! Nobu! So you have finally come, you fat southern barbarians!  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
What do you eat that makes you so fat,  
you wicked four-eyes! Hurry up and tell me!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, um... Are you talking to me?  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
What is it? You eat a pile of sugar candy for each meal? Or do you put grilled marshmallows in your tea?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, please refrain from harassment.  
I don't think my diet is that unbalanced.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Agh, this is starting to drag on...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Please stop, Fake Nobunaga! You're being manipulated by something too, right?  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
I don't think I was talking to you?  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
You 100% disappointing barbarian peasant!  
How dare you address me!  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
Return when you can destroy your enemies with an erotic pose like that plump southern barbarian there showing off her double melons!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What are these melons you talk about!?  
I am a Demi-Servant!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Ugh. This defiant tone of voice. I feel like we're going to be hearing this all-too soon again.  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
Fwahaha! Telling me, the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven to act like a magical girl! It's absurd!  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
A performance like that I can do in my spare time while unifying a nation!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Kyaa! Nobeeeww!!  
Thank you for coming! It means a lot!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Illya has been growing very STEADILY lately and is ready to welcome audiences from all different directions!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Keep your hopes up for this ultra grade school Magical Girl!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
What are you...!? You don't need to say that!  
Who are you trying to go up against!?  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
Hmph, are you trying to rub it in my face!?  
Trying to brag, eh!?  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
I've been a hot pit babe painted on a car before too!  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
Although it was as a big-headed sprite without the slightest bit of sexiness...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh, you were upset about that.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Um, I'm sorry Ruby brought up some painful memories...  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
I shall forgive you.  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
However, this Three Line Formation may not!  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
Anti-Army Noble Phantasm max release!  
Nobu Fight!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Ohh, this is the one that was easily avoided by warping in the original, right?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
It could be painful, but it may not have much effect against our Noble Phantasms?  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
Arg! However! I have come prepared just in case that would happen!  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
A new Noble Phantasm, a perfect blend of my loyal Monkey's knowledge and Shibata's courage!  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
From a Nobu Reversal to a Nobu Attack! And I shall finish you with my Nobu Buster by throwing you off the cliffs of Okehazama!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, doesn't appear there are any plans for a second Noble Phantasm like that.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
It doesn't sound like the history I studied either.  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
Is that so? Well, that cannot be helped!  
  
   
**Fake Nobunaga:**   
Curses! This is not the time for the Kiyosu Conference, Monkey and Shibata! It's time for some reinforcements, please!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm glad it's the same GudaGuda.

**Fake Altera:**   
Magical girls are bad civilization. (Heheh)  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Oh wow... she looks so self-satisfied...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Were you also summoned to this Reality Marble as a magical girl, f-fake Altera?  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
That is correct.  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
I am one of those who manifested in this Reality Marble as a magical girl who was unfulfilled.  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
But I stood out because I was too strong, and so I was ganged up on and defeated.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I see... We need to put an end to this!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you work for the First Lady?  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
I am aware of my subordination to her.  
It is humiliating, but I will not deny it.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Maybe it's her age?)  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
Did you say something? I couldn't hear it.  
You seem to be having throat trouble.  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
Perhaps we should see how far I can ram my Photon Ray down it?  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
Humph. It's true that defeat and submission are humiliating.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
But listen! I stand here by my own free will.  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
Magical girls are bad civilization.  
They must be destroyed.  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
If you have any rivals in the same season, you must defeat them. When you're over 12, you're automatically fired.  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
Mid-season you are required to ride a bus or go to the pool. You work Saturday mornings for 10 years straight. No, that's fine.  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
Do you understand? A civilization filled with competition like that will someday collapse.  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
Now that my self-interest as a Servant has been shorn away and I've been reborn with the power of a stick.  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
It's no exaggeration to say that I have surpassed my title of Great King and become the God of War.  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
I am... Shin Altzilla. (Heheh)  
  
   
**Illya:**   
S-She made that face again.  
She's got that self-satisfied look again.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
It looks like all the fake Servants have some strange stats maxed out.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
I wish they'd been averaged out a little!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wait... Altera...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Then, wouldn't it be disrespectful for us not to fight you?  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
That's right. You're so compassionate, Kyrielight.  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
But I will destroy. Thus, I will destroy.  
I will destroy you with the utmost respect.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What!?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That doesn't follow at all!  
I'm getting culture shock!  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
You'll just have to accept it. I was born this way.  
It is my core, and even if I am fake, that won't change.  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
At the end of the endless wasteland, I shall find a burning life.  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
Innocent girl. Wielder of white magecraft...  
  
   
**Fake Altera:**   
I raise my sword of ruin to destroy you!  
  
   
## The Land of Snow and Honey EXTRA II  
   
**Fake Jack:**   
Hwah? Mommy?  
  
   
**Fake Jack:**   
No, I guess not. We are the Echo of a magical girl.  
  
   
**Fake Jack:**   
An Echo who disappeared without ever knowing a warm hug, without being called a magical girl.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Even Jack the Ripper has turned into one of the First Lady's familiars...  
  
   
**Fake Jack:**   
Oh, are you my Mommy too?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Um, me...!? Mom!?  
  
   
**Fake Jack:**   
Yup! A soft and squishy Mommy!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Illya... Sometimes you must exercise your maternal instincts in your noble role as a magical girl.  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Now build up your courage...  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
Dashing around in a Merrrrrcedes Benz is definitely not a mother's role...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
There's something wrong with how you view girls!  
That's got nothing to do with magical girls!  
  
   
**Illya:**   
And why did you roll your “r”s like that!?  
Are you not allowed to just say the company name!?  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
That's right. I sometimes forget, but... There are rules in the world which supersede even magical girls...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
L-Life can be hard like that sometimes, huh?  
Anyway, ignoring Ruby...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Fake Jack, I'm sorry.  
I'm not...  
  
   
**Illya:**   
And if only I'd gotten here sooner!  
  
   
**Fake Jack:**   
Why are you apologizing?  
It was lots of fun!  
  
   
**Fake Jack:**   
Everyone here was us.  
We killed, and were killed...  
  
   
**Fake Jack:**   
But Mommy looks sad.  
Are you crying a little?  
  
   
**Fake Jack:**   
We're sorry we're not a good magical girl...  
  
   
**Fake Jack:**   
We need to kill even more, don't we?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Illya, this is all an illusion.  
   
**Illya:**   
Y-Yeah.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
That's right. This is an illusion created by the First Lady's familiar...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. It's a cunning trap.  
Let's end this... for her sake, too.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Not at all. I've been waiting for this.  
   
**Ruby:**   
Don't tell anybody this, but Jack fought herself through to the last part of the magical girl auditions.  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Is that so?  
  
   
**Illya:**   
Hey, Ruby! And Fujimaru, too!  
Don't talk about things that warp spacetime too much!  
  
   
**Ruby:**   
TAN☆GE! Congratulations on your new endeavor!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fake Jack:**   
Okay, let's do this, Mommy!  
  
   
**Fake Jack:**   
We'll use our magic to rip you into nice, pretty pieces!  
  
   
## Magical Gentleman - The Encounter  
   
**Mash:**   
...Where are we?  
This scenery looks familiar...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Woo-hoo! The show goes on!)  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Chloe:**   
What? Why are...why are we back?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And Chloe and Fou are here too?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um, I'm here too.  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, you look kind of happy, so you don't count!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, I'm sorry.  
I'm just panicking.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I was under the impression that traveling between this world and our own had become impossible.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
That's what Romani said.  
Is this another random Rayshift?  
  
   
**???:**  
LOLz! It's no coincidence!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That voice!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This dark and meme-ish aura...!  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
It's Blackbeard!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And for some reason he's wearing a miniskirt!?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
The character portrait cuts off at the waist, but the muscled thighs peeking out of his miniskirt make quite the impact.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
And me! Look upon me, as well!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
A ruffled petticoat! Clinging pure-white tights!  
A perfectly coordinated outfit!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fo, fou...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wh-What are you two, with your, um... unusual outfits, doing here?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Bwahaha, well, you see... (Approaching)  
You see...! (Thrust)  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
The pain!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, I'm sorry! I couldn't help it!  
Your beard and skirt left too much of an impact.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway, you're a bad influence on Chloe, so please move further away!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Otherwise, my shield will slice you thin!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Gnnuughhh! Your shield!?  
...Wait, how do shields work again!?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Mash, you look like Liz, but you're closer to Sella personality-wise.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I'm fine. You don't need to be so sensitive.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
There are some school nurses who don't wear underwear because “it's fashion, so it's not embarrassing.”  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
And it's kind of fun to see loser adults up close. Hehehe.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Chloe's kindness and her devilish smile are to die for!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
But are you telling me the principles expressed through our wardrobe are incomprehensible?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What do you mean?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(I get it, but I'll keep quiet.)  
  
  
---  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
We love magical girls every day of our lives, and worship them with all our hearts and souls!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Movies, merchandise, maidens' lovely voices in CDs!  
But that's not enough!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
We want to live with them, and become one with them... That's right! Together! To get HER!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Yes! We want to be with them as much as we can!  
But there's no point in us becoming magical girls IRL!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
And at last, SHE came, an answer to our ambivalent prayers!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
“SHE”? Do you mean The First Lady?  
  
  
---  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Mwahah! I ain't tellin'!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I'm not letting a traitor like Fujimaru join us!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The way you said “us” sounds like there are more than just the two of you.  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Indeed! There are four of us in all! You might call us the Four Heavenly☆Magical Gentlemen of Magical Girl-philia!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Once we learned of this space between parallel worlds...  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
...this très bon☆psychedelic land, there was only one thing we could do!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Summon that ever-distant Magical Girl utopia!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't get it.  
   
**Chloe:**   
It sounds like someone's getting loose with the story writing.  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
That is why we desire...the truth that lies in the rifts of fiction!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Gotcha! Add me and to make it five!  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
You're not allowed, Fujimaru!  
You think you can just join us like that smh...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I'm not benevolent enough to let in a traitor like you!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Oh, but we'd be more than happy to have Chloe! You could be an honorary magical girl advisor to the We Love Magical Girls Alliance!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
That sounds fun, but I'll pass.  
I don't like joining little cliques like that.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
You never did tell us your reasoning behind those outfits, but let's put that thought aside.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, Chloe, have you noticed?  
This world is somehow...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Yeah. It's changed a lot since we left.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
The spatial connections and the presences of enemies lurking around are all surprisingly different.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
And I don't see Helena anywhere, even though she stayed behind.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
If this is a different Reality Marble, then Reality Marbles have become pretty cruddy.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What should we do, Master?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is there any danger in letting this infestation spread?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Don't talk about us like we're insects!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't like that one bit.  
   
**Mash:**   
Neither do I.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't want to question their hobbies, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But we can't let them go out of control to the point where they threaten other worlds or Chaldea...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We can't let more magical girls suffer.  
   
**Chloe:**   
That might happen.  
But Fujimaru...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I kind of agree with those old guys.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
OMG Chloe! Are you a goddess?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Chloe:**   
Does it really matter? It's natural to want to be near cute things.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Right, Fou? (Squeeze)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Kyuu...  
  
   
**Blackbeard & Phantom:**   
(Squee)  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
But... But even so...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
This is my first mission... and you're going to pay for turning it into a stupid farce!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
You'll suffer so much pain you'll wish you'd never been born! It'll be certain death for you!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
It stopped being a farce the moment you said that!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Very well! Try and stop the Four Heavenly☆Magical Gentlemen! Many trials await you, maybe!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
More specifically, the strongest warriors that we could find...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Caladbolg II.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
OMG! This young tanned girl is dangerous!?  
Sexy!? And fatal!?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Tch, missed...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Ooh, she's looking at us like we're bugs! Scary!  
In the future she's gonna make one hell of a dominatrix!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
But that's not what we want from you, Chloe...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
We want you to be more like, um... all the little devil girls of the world turned into one...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Caladbolg III!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Whoa! Terrible! I'm very sad to say that there seems to be no room to negotiate... so retreat! Retreat!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Yes... No objections... No objections...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wait! Blackbeard! Phantom!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At least change so it doesn't hurt to look at you!  
Change before you retreat, please!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I guess we have to go after the Four Gentlemen?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Roger!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Yes. I'm gonna get serious for the first time in a while!  
  
   
## White Masked Gentleman - The Destiny  
   
**Phantom:**   
To think you would follow me this far... You must know that I am made of death from head to toe!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
But I will escape without making a sound.  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
I shall escape through the rift between truth and lies, the stage and the dressing room, and both sides of the world!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
And everything I do is for you!  
For you, my diva!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
He makes even less sense than that beard guy.  
I'm not sure who he means by “diva.”  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe he means a magical girl!?  
   
**Fou:**   
Foufoufou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I think Fou is saying, “That's exactly right.”  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A singing magical girl... Sounds great.  
   
**Phantom:**   
Indeed. A whisper is a primitive spell. But the beautiful voice of a songbird, one that stirs the heart? Now that's something truly bewitching.  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Songs are true magic. Songs are true magic. A beautiful singing voice raises a girl's magic to its highest potential.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Actually, Master...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm starting to think we have no reason to stop Phantom.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It seems to me he is seriously thinking about magical girls. Don't you think?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I don't know about that. If being “serious” makes something okay, then most criminals are serious about what they do, too.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then let's ask Phantom.  
  
  
---  
   
**Chloe:**   
Let me ask you a question. What would you do with a little bird that stopped singing?  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Wait for it to sing, whisper to it to help it sing, then kill it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Kill... What if it were a hummingbird that always had an unpleasant voice?  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
It should cut out its own tongue, jump into a furnace, and turn itself into grilled chicken. Or perhaps explode.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How about a robin with an angelic voice?  
  
  
---  
   
**Phantom:**   
Ooh! That would be my Christine!  
She must stay with me...  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
...in a tightly sealed room where the sun never shines, filled with stone and chains and leather!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Until the moment when she dies, and her love is filled with the flames of hatred and the desire to kill!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
D-Does that mean you'd lock her up regardless of her wishes?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
That's totally selfish!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Looks like we should try to convince him with a song.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'd rather sing along with someone.  
   
**Fou:**   
Foufooou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I'd like that too!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can do a good chicken impression.  
   
**Chloe:**   
Hahaha. That's right.  
Even birds that can't fly have the right to sing.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Phantom:**   
Nonsense. But entertaining nonetheless.  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
You've gotten my hopes up.  
But will my ears judge your songs worthy?  
  
   
## Blackbeard Gentleman - The Treachery  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Shiver me timbers, you seriously followed me all the way here? I'm impressed, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Feel free to beat me and take my spot in the Four Heavenly☆Magical Gentlemen, if you want! Pew pew pew!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Blackbeard, let us confirm one thing...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You are one of the people behind this, are you not?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We need to know the truth, so we can put an end to this.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If you are plotting something that will make innocent girls cry, even I cannot defend you. Keep that in mind!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Oh, so nice. You're still trying to believe in me...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Mash is so wonderful... So radiant...  
That stuff really turns me on...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Trying to defend trash like me... Are you the type of girl who can only love a loser?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Stop messing around!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Wait, Mash.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Maybe this is his serious mode.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? Is it?  
I-I'm sorry...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Ahah. You really are a goddess, Chloe.  
And Mash is an angel.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
But you're girls, too. It might be worth listening to what I have to say!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
You see, once a man's got a treasure, he loses interest in it.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
But you know, I hate to work hard!  
I don't want a girl who's way out of my league!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I want somebody close yet just out of reach.  
That's the type of treasure I want.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that your ideal magical girl...?  
  
  
---  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
You'd think that, right!? But get real!  
I'd never get anyone that way!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
There's gotta be some indignity in there! Build up a sweet relationship, and then, BAM! Like a boss-pirate!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
That's what makes for good entertainment, right!? Playing it safe is boring!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Yeah, I kind of understand, though I really don't want to.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I want to confirm something, Master.  
This exchange is a complete waste of time, isn't it?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yup.  
   
**Mash:**   
Good to know!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's just a pirate, a so-called perverted gentleman.  
   
**Chloe:**   
Fanboys have their own set of rules, but the pirate's way compels him to break the rules and take what he wants.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Yes! Let there be light in the heart of magical girls everywhere! Just like there's always indignity in my heart!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay. It's time for him to walk the plank.  
   
**Mash:**   
Right! Tie a cannonball to his legs!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Once you've learned your lesson, come back to Chaldea!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okay. It's time for him to be shark bait.  
   
**Chloe:**   
Sharks? I think even sharks have the right to choose what kind of food they want to eat.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Let's talk about sharks and stuff!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway, we're taking you back to Chaldea, Blackbeard!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
No yo-ho-ing way! I'm not going back!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I'm an eternal teenager!  
A captain sailing the seas of Neverland!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
So have fun! Have lots and lots of fun, guys!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Soon, the greatest magical girl of all is about to weigh anchor and set sail! How's that for a flag?  
  
   
## Bluebeard Gentleman - The Memories  
   
**Gilles:**   
Oh... Jeanne!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jeanne? Where!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Gilles de Rais? You're one of the Four Heavenly☆Magical Gentlemen?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
This guy's appearance is even more shocking.  
Especially surrounded by all that cute merchandise...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Wait a minute. Wasn't Gilles de Rais a marshal who fought with Jeanne d'Arc?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Why's he into magical girls? Shouldn't he be more into saints and witches and stuff?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You know what? You're right.  
  
  
---  
   
**Gilles:**   
Magic isn't the only miracle. A girl who embodies the miracles of God is also in the category of magical girls.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
A magical girl who wields sufficiently advanced technology as if it were magic.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
A magical girl who took mere tricks and elevated them to the realm of real magic.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Is there a problem with such enchanting magical girls existing? No, they must exist!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
When young Jeanne heard the voice of God and turned it into strength for our soldiers, she was truly a magical girl calling forth a divine intervention!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Oh... young, naive Jeanne. How I long to see you again...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Gotcha. Categorizing is important.  
   
**Mash:**   
That explanation convinced you?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Like how there are lots of different Riders.  
   
**Chloe:**   
That's right. When I heard a sailor like Blackbeard was a Rider, I was a little confused,  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
But that means you could have a Rider who rides trains or rockets too, right?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
But Gilles, you yourself are a Caster...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Were you the one controlling the stick familiars?  
   
**Gilles:**   
Absolutely not!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
How could these filthy hands ever touch her magic stick?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
He's probably talking about, you know, that person...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Blackbeard and Bluebeard. They've both got beards.  
   
**Chloe:**   
If you could get a Whitebeard, Redbeard, and Yellowbeard, you could have the Beard Olympics.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Gilles:**   
Oh! Who are you? Oh... Oooh, a bronze-skinned Jeanne!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Huh? Me? Who are you calling Jeanne?  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Your gaze, your eyes, your noble nose, the stoutness in the way you move! It's all just like her!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
O-Okay.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Oh, magical girl! Young saint of magic!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Come, come, come down to us, please!  
Guide us with your holy pennant!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, more importantly... Gilles, what are all these offerings? And this altar? It looks like it's for some ritual.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
...Oh? What's this!?  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
JEANNE! The eggplant-colored Jeanne that looks good in glasses!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, are you speaking about me now?  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
The cuticles of your holy hair, your lips speaking of compassion! Your huge breasts, filled with dreams of saving the country!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I am a Demi-Servant!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
W-Wait, don't you have any standards?  
How many Jeannes are there?  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Oooh! What fortune! Three Jeannes in a single day!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? You don't mean me, do you?  
  
  
---  
   
**Gilles:**   
Oooh... Jeanne! Fluffy, soft Jeanne!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Your cute little ears! Your soft, bountiful hair that resembles a tail! You're the living image of Jeanne!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Kyaau, fofoou!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah... Let's get him, Fou.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Somehow I feel disappointed...and humiliated...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!!  
  
   
## Jade Gentleman - The Blood Tears  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
D-Don't come near me!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
S-Stay back! Adult women, stay away from me!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Diarmuid?  
   
**Mash:**   
Diarmuid is one of the Four Heavenly☆Magical Gentlemen?!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What in the world?  
   
**Chloe:**   
What the... He's crying tears of blood!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Adult women... They're so strong-willed!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
They're so cunning, and they don't show their true sides! They expect to be protected, yet they plot to dominate behind the scenes!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
On the other hand, magical girls are physically strong. They don't complain about trivial things like their feet hurting from walking and so on!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
That's not exactly true.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
There are even structural differences in their hearts!  
And I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said the color of their souls is different too...  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Oh, the beauty of magical girls who have a sense of duty and battle dauntlessly! Ugh. In contrast, adult women...  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
One minute it's “My computer is broken, so fix it,” but before you know it, they start sulking because I'M the one with the bad attitude...  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Just tell me which OS and what apps you were using, already!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Adult women are scary... Scary...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Yikes. What a waste of a handsome face.  
He's obviously out of his mind.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
What on earth would make someone descend this far into misery?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
But maybe the wounded puppy thing isn't so bad.  
I just want to wrap my arms around him.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Chloe! It's a spell! Don't fall for it!  
   
**Chloe:**   
Huh!? Ugh... Arrrggh... This loser has an irresistible beauty spot!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash, does he have any effect on you?  
   
**Mash:**   
W-What's wrong, Master? I'm not going anywhere.  
You don't have to hold my hand so suddenly.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I'm not feeling any different...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
W-Well, I have to admit, my heartbeat has quickened a bit and my temperature has risen.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Okay, okay, that's enough!  
But don't forget to stay on alert!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
I know the reason for your visit here, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
However, please, go no further!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Only before magical girls am I treated as an equal, able once again to swear my loyalty.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
As such, I see Blackbeard and Phantom as brothers, too!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
I cannot attain magical girlhood, but I can fulfil my knightly duties and present them with a tiara.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hold your head up higher, Lancer!  
   
**Chloe:**   
Um, is your head screwed in okay?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Compared to the other old guys, his extreme seriousness worries me a little.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Take better care of yourself, Lancer...  
   
**Mash:**   
G-Get well soon. I mean it.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Mash and that tanned maiden I haven't seen before...  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
I'm telling you this for your own good: never become an adult woman.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Wh-Whaaat? What kind of advice is that!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Not to mimic a certain iron nurse, but I also sense the necessity of medical treatment through heavy firepower!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All right, let's go!  
  
  
---  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
There is no other path. I must humbly enter battle!  
  
  
## Testament Prologue  
   
**Chloe:**   
Well, now we've defeated the self-proclaimed Four Heavenly☆Magical Gentlemen! They certainly gave us enough trouble.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
We still don't know what they were after...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
But at least now this entire twisted world is finished, right!?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Let's go back...to Chaldea?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Something strange is happening! Again!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that our final destination?  
  
  
---  
   
**Chloe:**   
How nice of them to make it so clear for us.  
Trap, right?  
  
   
## Witness the Transformation  
   
**Chloe:**   
I need to ask...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Is there another perverted magical girl fanboy waiting for us? Like the leader of the Four Heavenly☆Magical Gentlemen?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You mean the one that Four Heavenly☆Magical Gentlemen have referred to?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What's that...?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Shadows forming a Prisma Cosmos-ish shape!?  
  
  
---  
   
**D：???:**  
That's right, it's me. Do you demons dare stand in the way of magical girls?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
D-Demons!? Us?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fouuu!?  
  
   
**Testament:**   
My name is Testament, like the sign of my holy covenant with those gentlemen!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's like how the First Lady took over Chloe...no, you look like Illya!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So Illya was the ideal magical girl?  
   
**Testament:**   
If that's what you think, then my form reflects it so.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I'm stunned. Instead of using my body this time, a form was created directly out of magical energy?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Like a knockoff of a knockoff?  
   
**Chloe:**   
Don't call me a knockoff! You don't have any issues with my Cosmos design, right?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Though I admit this is getting confusing.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Chloe:**   
But, well, I am a bit relieved.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I was afraid Mama was going to appear. “Prisma☆Iri has descended in all of her splendor!” she'd say.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Turns out I was worried for nothing.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I imagine that would have been quite the psychological blow...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's the purpose of the Four Gentlemen?  
  
  
---  
   
**Testament:**   
Phantom, Gilles de Rais, Diarmuid, and Blackbeard.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
Through their mighty wishes and noble sacrifices, I was able to form into a genuine existence. Heehee.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
You can't just say “a genuine existence” and laugh like that so casually!  
  
   
**Testament:**   
It's true. I am the crystallization of their thoughts.  
An idol created by sad gentlemen.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
Just as a girl's feelings become a magical girl's driving force, the wishes of those gentlemen gave me life and let me soar.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're the crystallization of their thoughts? No, I don't think so. And it wasn't so much their wishes as it was their obsession.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
True. And instead of noble, let's go with pathetic.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I know I'm one to talk, considering I was involved heavily in the first half of the event, but you're really warped.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
How many times do I have to say that it's meaningless to change the world with magic based on sacrifices?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
More than anything, it's annoying to hear those words come out of someone who looks like Illya. So knock it off.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
Heehee, you have a problem with sacrifices?  
They were happy to offer themselves to me.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
I will give them everything.  
But I am not going to repay them.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
If that's what they wanted, there are plenty of women in the real world.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
All they need is to be captivated by my dancing during the ending credits.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
Just loop a recycled transformation sequence until it's burned into their retinas.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
The more the wishes of men are full of gloom and a hopeless sense of inferiority, the more brilliantly my dream shines!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
What!? You got nasty all of a sudden!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's like a beautiful lotus growing in the mud.  
   
**Testament:**   
Yes, that's right.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
I may grant their wishes, but I will never mingle with them. That's who I am.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I won't allow you to belittle magical girl fans!  
   
**Testament:**   
Identifying yourself as a “fan” out of some silly pride is just embarrassing.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Testament:**   
You know what it is?  
  
   
**Testament:**   
In the world of magical girls, filthy men are worse than demons. They're worthless scum.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
And you know what else?  
  
   
**Testament:**   
Magical girls should only fall in love with each other♡  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
...Uh...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No good. She's rotten to the core.  
   
**Chloe:**   
Maybe she would've been better off borrowing Miyu's form.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What about cute pretty boy familiars?  
   
**Fou:**   
Kyuu?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fo, fouuuu. Fou, fou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It seems Fou strongly objects to that remark.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Testament:**   
Heehee, but this is perfect.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
My tale has only just begun, so I'll leave you with a parting gift, demons!  
  
   
**Testament:**   
While gathering the wishes of men and turning them into despair, I'll leave them with minimum HP and inspire in them vain hope.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
So don't interfere with my journey of endlessly granting bittersweet heaven and hell!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I swear she's pure evil.  
   
**Mash:**   
And I agree!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't like it when the DM brings a SO to play.  
   
**Fou:**   
Kyuu.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Testament:**   
Okay. That aside, it's hard to fight in this dress, so I'd better transform!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
What!? I have a bad feeling about this!  
Does she intend to use my body, too!?  
  
   
**Testament:**   
Heehee, that isn't necessary.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
I'll show you with this body what color suits a true magical girl!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You mean like 99% flesh-colored?  
   
**Chloe:**   
Morals! We're going into dangerous territory!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
But if you insist, then by all means, show me! Show me the ideal magical girl's combat uniform and how she fights!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe like her 2wei Herz beast scale figure?  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, please calm down! Isn't that the kind of bold, brazen wish that spawned her in the first place?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
That's right! Although...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I'm not against that kind of thing myself, but there's a time and place for everything!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
## World End Match: Testament  
   
**Testament:**   
Ooohhh... Unghh...  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Wh-What's wrong?  
Did it really hurt that much?  
  
   
**Testament:**   
In the end...  
  
   
**Testament:**   
Of course no one could be the ideal and almighty magical girl for everybody!  
  
   
**Testament:**   
The very idea is ridiculous!  
  
   
**Testament:**   
A character that fulfills the requests of all gentlemen?  
I'd be so bland I'd fade away into nothingness!  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Now she's being brutally honest!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-Then what about what we did?  
Aren't you a victim now?  
  
   
**Testament:**   
No. This too is a result influenced by the wishes of those gentlemen... (Glance)  
  
   
**Testament:**   
Hiding one's goodness deep inside while being forced to do evil deeds is hot, right? It's kind of a staple, isn't it? (Glance)  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Yeesh. This girl is beyond redemption.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
The power of the feelings from Blackbeard and the others is gone. It supported me well up to now. I must be grateful for that...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Testament...  
  
  
---  
   
**Testament:**   
You are guests.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
You were summoned to this world both as spectators to a magical girl's exploits and as demons.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
When my influence disappears, the alterations to this Reality Marble will also be undone.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
This world will return to the peaceful resting place of magical girls, managed by Helena.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
When that happens, you will be shot out.  
  
   
**Testament:**   
But you'll be able to return safely to Chaldea.  
So rest assured.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Testament...  
  
   
**Testament:**   
...  
  
   
**Testament:**   
If there is a magical girl who has reached perfection, like one that they were seeking, I wonder who will understand her misery...  
  
   
**Testament:**   
Who will save that girl?  
  
   
**Testament:**   
Who will show magic to a magical girl...?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She was self-centered, but also a sad person.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
You think so? I'm sure that was all calculated, too.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Although maybe that was better than leaving us with a parting shot like, “There will be a second and third magical girl waiting for you!”  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Be it magic or miracles, there's always equivalent exchange.  
   
**Chloe:**   
That... may be right.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
But hardship and effort with no reward is also the way of the world.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
So no matter who becomes happy, I can't find it in myself to blame them.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can't tell if Chloe is pessimistic or optimistic.  
...She's a mysterious girl.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(I see, now that's textbook savage.)  
   
**Mash:**   
Master? What was that smile for just now?  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Yes, don't take any weird lessons from this.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
It's wrong to try to bend other people to your will in the first place!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
It seems like we're out of time. This warped world is being restored to its natural state.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
(Sigh)  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
I'm not crazy about the circumstances that brought us here, but I did have fun.  
  
   
**Chloe:**   
Next time take me on a proper mission, okay, Fujimaru?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sure. That's a promise.  
   
**Chloe:**   
Good. That's my Master.  
...Thank you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'd rather take Illya for sure...  
   
**Chloe:**   
Hey! Don't say your feelings out loud!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sometimes I can't tell whether Master is an enemy, ally, or rebel...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's a good thing to be honest with yourself, right?  
As long as you don't forget to be considerate.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, everyone, let's return to Chaldea.  
You too, Fou.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fouuu!
