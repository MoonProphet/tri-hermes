# The Demonic Capital Rashomon  
  
## Opening Act: Heian Sakura Front Line  
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;Rayshift complete.  
We've arrived in Japan, Master.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And it seems you got there safely. Sorry if the ride was bumpy, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As if to be expected, I'm not getting a clear visual of you. This time it's even worse than normal.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm guessing you can't pinpoint the cause?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. There are times when you travel so far back that we don't have enough data on that era...but that's not the case here.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This observation impediment doesn't follow any pattern we've seen before. It's like someone is jamming our signal.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
However, the fact remains that I'm picking up very unusual responses from that era. It's bound to turn into a Singularity if we leave it alone.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's why I sent you two to check it out.  
For starters, what are your surroundings like?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right. Well, it's safe here. I mean, we've never been to a place this idyllic. Especially, um...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The cherry blossoms are lovely.  
Just beautiful.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Cherry blossoms, huh? That's nice. I've seen them before, too. Although I didn't get to have a viewing party...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...On top of that, there's a kind of sweet aroma...all around... Mm...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, I'd say it smells delicious.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wait, could this scent be...  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmmm... An aroma you say... I wonder what it could be. We definitely need more information.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
My estimate is that you're in the Heian era right now. That said, the Heian era lasted for nearly 400 years.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Stand by while I try to pinpoint your exact coordinates. Please keep an eye on your surroundings.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. Still...  
I can't get over how beautiful it is here.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I can't get over how beautiful you are, Mash.  
   
**Mash:**   
   
R-Right... As you can see, my primary colors are purple and black... So I am no match for the beautiful pink of cherry blossoms.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I wish we had some dumplings from the moon festivals.  
   
**Mash:**   
Hehe. Shhh, Senpai.  
Caesar will appear if you bring that up again.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
But... Ummm. Actually, this has been bothering me since we got here...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's a big pile of petals over there, but it's human-shaped.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's as if someone fell asleep while viewing the cherry blossoms and was left behind for a full day...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Ah&mdash;chooo! Ahhh, what, morning already!? Daaammit!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
K-Kintoki!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay, if I just do this and voila... Huh?  
Hey, I'm picking up a Servant in your proximity.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Going by the powerful magical energy reading... No doubt about it, it's a musclehead Servant with a suffocating presence!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Doctor. Mr. Golden, Sakata Kintoki himself is right in front of us.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, Kintoki is there.  
That would explain this strength level I'm seeing.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, what's he doing there!?  
Did you two bring him along!?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Oooh, my head hurts... I went overboard brawling with those bears...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Golden morning, mister.  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Oh! That's a nice greeting, Boss!  
To be golden in the morning is very golden!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
God morning, Kintoki.  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
O-Oh, that's a strange mangling of the language.  
“God morning” sounds a little ominous.  
  
   
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
At any rate, it's good to start off with a greeting.  
It shows you have good manners.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
A fulfilling day begins with a nice greeting, a nice breakfast, and nice wood-chopping.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
My boss... Oh, I don't mean you.  
My former boss, or I guess more like my foster parent...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Boss Raikou, you know?  
She lived around here.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
She was usually lax, but very serious about table manners. Even bad sitting posture would earn a demonic glare.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, Kintoki. My apologies for interrupting, but would you tell us what you're doing here?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Oh, sorry. I slipped into reminiscing about the olden days. But the reason I'm here&mdash;  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Whoa, wait. Don't get too close.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
(I'm the one just waking up here... And even though I'm the man they called the Beast of Ashigara...)  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
(Dangerous... she's the true dangerous beast!  
I mean, look at her outfit!)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, he won't look me in the eye.  
Does he hate me now?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't think that's it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Dangerous... beast!  
   
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
No, it's not your fault, young lady.  
In fact, I would compliment you, if you were a man.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
H-Huh? Thank you... I think?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Oh, you even bow to me?!  
Then I gotta man up... Here we go...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
K-Kintoki!? Oh no, Senpai, Kintoki is punching himself hard in the cheek!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
All right, that woke me up!  
So, shall we get going, Boss!?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I wouldn't call it a world crisis, but there's trouble in my neck of the woods.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Deep in the mountains, somebody called.  
I don't know who it is, but I'm goin' there.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
All the signs point to good things, so I'll push on ahead. My axe will carve a way through the mountains. Make way for this thunderclap!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Kintoki sure is in high spirits!  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I've never seen him so full of energy.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That said... Where are we going?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Um... Where are we going?  
   
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Huh? Where are we going? Why, that's obvious.  
It's&mdash;  
  
   
**???:**  
   
Gyaaaaooooo&mdash;!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Aaaah! A hostile response already!  
Is it&ndash;a wild beast?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Your ambush is well-timed&mdash;! But I don't think I've seen you around these parts before!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It seems to see us as food.  
It's charging!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
This is also a perfect way to start the day.  
A nice warm-up! Let's go wild, Master!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good work.  
I've finally got your coordinates now.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
North latitude 35 degrees, east longitude 135 degrees 45 minutes approximately. The cultural and political center of Japan in this era.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In other words, if you go down that mountain&mdash;  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
There's only one place with a sky and cherry blossoms like this. We stand before Kyoto.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's Kyo&ndash; He stole my line! I shouldn't have started off with the latitude and longitude!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's okay, Doctor.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Someday we may have to take a geography test with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
When that happens, this information should come in handy. Thank you very much.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash, you can be rather brutal sometimes...  
Okay, one more piece of new info.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You were just talking about an aroma, right?  
I got curious, so I analyzed it...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There's ethanol mixed in with the air.  
Fruits and crops fermented using yeast.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In other words, alcohol. What you're smelling is wine.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
The smell of wine, huh?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Kintoki? You seem like a guy who can hold his drink.  
Bad memories or something?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I've never heard of anything good happening when alcohol was involved.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's true. It's usually stories of someone getting drunk and embarrassing themselves!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...That's right.  
Jeez, I've got a golden bad feeling about this.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Enough about drinking.  
I've located the point of the abnormality too.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ignore what we can't understand for now, and head there as planned to investigate it.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's why you're here, right, Kintoki?  
But when did you use the Rayshift?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Huh? Boss was the one who called me, right?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I just found myself here all of a sudden! I was bored, so I trained with a bear, slept, and then it was morning.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Hmm? So you were forcibly summoned there.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Yeah. Looks like there's more to it, but the details don't matter. Boss, you need more people, right?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Then leave it to me! As you can see, I've got more strength than I know what to do with!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Thanks, that's a big help.  
Take care and proceed.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
This is a bad mist.  
Smoke on the whatsits, you know?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There's a bit of a ways till you get to the source.  
What's the situation where you're at?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It looks like we're in a residential district near Kyoto... But something seems strange...  
  
   
**Kyoto Resident:**   
Hahahaha! Ahahahaha!  
Food! Drink! Bring more!  
  
   
**Kyoto Resident:**   
You rotten fiend! I never liked the way you married your childhood friend! Now let's celebrate!  
  
   
**Kyoto Resident:**   
I like you. I love you! Take me! Take me now!  
Take me to paradise! Huh? You're married? Then die!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's chaos.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Some kind of weird festival?  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
To be honest, I don't understand what's going on. Everyone seems to be doing something different.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Everybody's getting excited about their own thing...  
What is going on here?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
A lot of them are saying some rough stuff, but they're still sane. It's fine until the blades come out, but...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...Did you notice?  
It's getting thicker.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's no telling what will happen.  
Senpai, we need to be more careful than ever.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The cherry blossoms are as pretty as ever but&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh!? Senpai, watch out!  
(Squeeze)  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What's wrong? What happened!?  
An enemy attack?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash just jumped...on me...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This sensation... She's a beast!  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Whew. That was close.  
A cherry blossom petal fell on Senpai's head.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai has an important duty to perform.  
I can't let anything threaten that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I, Mash Kyrielight, want to help Senpai.  
More, more, more. More.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So&ndash;Huh!? Look at that foul-smelling mystery trap!  
It may be an enemy Noble Phantasm! Get back! (Squeeze-squeeze)    
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
No, that's just a fertilizer pit.  
if you fall in, you're gonna regret it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh? Senpai, your face is a little red.  
Do you have a fever? ...No, perhaps a cold?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Are you okay? Does it hurt anywhere?  
Do you want headpats?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Come to think of it, you were sleeping with your stomach exposed this morning.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But don't worry. It's okay now that I'm here.  
I'll sleep next to you tonight.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
With my Noble Phantasm I can keep you safe from cold viruses, as well as nasty cedar pollen!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can shut out all nasty insects and external enemies completely!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash is acting weird!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Medic... Medic!  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm? Wait a second. Is this...  
I see. I knew it.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
By the way, how about you, Kintoki?  
Anything seem off with you?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
No need to worry.  
I'm always golden.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Actually, I feel stronger!  
I feel like I'm overflowing with energy!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Did you hear that, Senpai? Mr. Golden is filled with too much energy, he says. Scary, huh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But don't worry. Even if he approaches you with a sexual proposition,  
  
   
**Mash:**   
my shield will deploy to secure you with incredible speed.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
No, I'm not that kind of guy...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Hey, Boss?  
Is she always like this?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Actually, she kind of is.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No, this time it's worse than usual.  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Um, well... This is extremely hard to say, but...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm seeing a slight change on her vitals.  
She's drunk.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Drunk? Just on this aroma?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. It doesn't seem to be affecting you, though.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's because of the alcohol that's permeating the air. That's what's gotten into the people around you, too.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Whoever breathes it in gets drunk.  
That's why they're all acting like that.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
How about you, Fujimaru?  
Anything seem strange?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not really. I'm sober.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I've never been drunk, so I don't know.  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm. Maybe the protective power that Mash should have is being transferred to her Master?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Still, that's the right thing for the moment. No matter how drunk she is, Mash will follow Fujimaru's orders.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If Fujimaru went nuts, we'd have a golden disaster on our hands.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai! Senpai! Stop spending so much time talking with the Doctor, and let's go. We have a ways to walk.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Guess we'll have to keep going.  
Though my bad feeling keeps getting worse... Huh?  
  
   
**Kyoto Resident:**   
   
Yahoo! A bunch o' fresh country bumpkins!  
  
   
**Kyoto Resident:**   
Leave all your valuables!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I will not!  
Senpai's going with me!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, we'll eliminate this obstacle.  
Let's do it together!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What's strange about this is that she seems normal at first glance...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Is there a reason they're getting drunk like this?  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Tch... It stinks.  
I mean, there are good drinks and bad drinks.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
And this is a really bad one.  
It ain't something a person should be drinking.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Harder to reach you...  
All I can manage is audio... Be careful...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's strange. We should be getting closer to central Kyoto, but&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It feels so empty. I don't see a single person.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What? Kyoto was the center of Japan in that era.  
There can't just be no one there&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But it's true. I'll add that there are several corpses lying on the side of the road.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It seems clear that something's going up ahead.  
...Mr. Golden, you know Kyoto well, right?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Yeah, I guess. But this is different.  
This ain't the Kyoto I know.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Kyoto's a golden city.  
The atmosphere, the people, even the laughter shines.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
That's normal and natural in Kyoto. That's why in the future that amazing, cool golden temple is gonna be built.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(He's probably talking about the Kinkaku... Rokuon-ji...)  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I don't like it.  
This dead, alcohol-stinking air ain't Kyoto.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Drinks are for warming up the heart.  
It ain't something to melt the marrow of your bones.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...Tch. I don't want to remember it,  
but this alcohol is&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, I see a big gate.  
Is it past this?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Yes...but...be careful...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Uh! What is this? A dragonkin!?  
Everyone, be extremely careful&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah! I see something near the gate, Master!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...And to think I thought this was just a lot of fun. Pathetic. I feel pathetic.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Poison, miasma, hedonism, and decadence, all mixed up. That means only one thing.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
That ain't a bunch of little things mixed together.  
It's the real aura of an oni.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Haha!  
Bwahahahaha!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
And there you are, Ibaraki-Douji!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I wondered who it was. Haha!  
Who does it turn out to be but Sakata Kintoki!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
It's been so damn long! So long!  
You alone? Where's Raikou? Where's Tsuna?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
You've got eyes, don't you?  
But you... You ain't alone, are ya?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Tell me. What is that?  
What is that thing floating behind you?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Hah! This is my master, and my sacrifice!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Our fallen leader of the oni clan, Shuten-Douji!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Bwaha! Hahaha! Hahahahaha!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
&mdash;!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Hah! Ticked off, huh?  
Even behind that strange blindfold I can tell!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Your eyes are shining with a burning light.  
That must've ticked you off, huh?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
&mdash;Humph. But I am even more displeased than you. Would the likes of you really care about Shuten?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
After you tricked her and slew her? Why would you care about Shuten when I am about to eat her?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
You idiot! I ain't worried! I don't care what you do!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
If you're gonna fight each other, do it somewhere else! And anyway&mdash;  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
You have any idea how dangerous that wench is?  
After you eat her she'll devour you from the inside out!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
&ndash;Humph. That's right.  
The old me wouldn't have been able to defeat her.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
But you know what?  
&mdash;Race forward, Sougenbi!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Gwaah!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...What ...happened...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Some huge flaming thing just flew out and blew Kintoki away!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And... now it's coming back!  
That's... That's...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Tch. Is that...your arm?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Indeed. Indeed! Indeed! Indeed! This is my arm of destruction! I call it the Great Grudge of Rashomon!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
She's got a damn rocket punch!  
I thought Tsuna hacked that thing off!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No way... That's a Noble Phantasm. She's using her own severed arm as a Noble Phantasm&ndash;  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Bwahahaha! Little girl! Little girl! Little girl!  
Have you ever seen anything like me?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Then carve this into your mind, so you'll have something to remember as the maggots eat your guts!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Raging like a beast! Terrifying like a god!  
Frivolous like an insect!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
We know not the weakness of mankind, nor the pride of a warrior! We use our own rotted arms as weapons!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
That is what an oni is. We are man-eating monsters, who inspire fear by our very presence!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
...They're speaking to me.  
Yes, someone, somewhere, is saying it.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
&ndash;Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour. Devour&ndash;  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Devour mankind. Devour you!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
You are human. Flesh for me to eat.  
You are Sakata Kintoki, my mortal enemy.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
And I am Ibaraki-Douji.  
The ruler of all the oni on Mt. Ooe!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
And thus... You shall not leave this place alive!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...Stupid. Ibaraki's even stupider than last time.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You know her, Kintoki?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Yeah. She's just an animal that doesn't like people.  
We don't get along.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
But she wasn't that bad.  
She used to follow the laws of the food chain...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But now she's not... She's an oni killing people for no reason, not just to survive?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Yup. That's what she's become.  
And that puts her in my jurisdiction.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I see you've got some yummy kids with you!  
They can fill my belly too!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Sure, bring it, little oni!  
I'll smash that big arm of yours into tiny pieces!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
That's my line, you wannabe westerner!  
I'll eat your bones along with Shuten!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
(That oni girl screwed up big... Isn't Mt. Ooe yours, fool?)  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Aah, aah&ndash; A lovely wind is blowing.  
It smells of guts and blood and alcohol.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
It is the smell of the demonic city that I desire!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I'm so happy, Kintoki.  
Soon&ndash;the smell of your guts will be mixed in with it too!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Bwaha! Bwahahahaha!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Her murderous intent is incredible...  
She's coming, Master! Get ready to fight!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Right. One warning, Boss.  
that ain't the Ibaraki I know.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is she that strong?  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
She might be strong enough that you could throw all your Servants at her and have a 50/50 chance.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I knew it! Her lines are really...something!  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Nah, she was always like that.  
That hasn't changed a bit.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
But she's a lot stronger!  
A helluva lot stronger than the Ibaraki I knew!  
  
   
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Anyway, this is good stuff!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
The little oni who hid in Shuten's shadow has grown up to reach the level of a god!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
A worthy opponent! Let's go, Boss!  
Time for some golden oni hunting!  
  
   
## Chase Battle: Back From Zero  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Tch! She's fierce!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Bwahaha! Bwahaha! This is exciting!  
It's so exciting, huh, Kintoki?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
If you grab a man he snaps in two.  
Pat him and you'll split him open!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
But battling you is like wrestling a mountain!  
And this won't stop till one of us is dead!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
It would be boring to let this end so soon.  
Time to take a break!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I won't let you go, idiot!  
Blow 'em away, Golden&ndash;  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Bwaha! Don't be in such a hurry!  
Don't be in such a hurry! Our banquet continues!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Bwahahaha!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She ran beyond the gate so quickly... She's so fast.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm sorry, Mr. Golden. We're badly damaged as well. We've used too much energy.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It feels very dangerous to pass through the gate like this...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Yeah, you're right.  
Sorry, this wasn't just my fight, was it?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Fine. We'll come back tomorrow.  
Let's eat something while we can.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Even with Kyoto in this state, there's gotta be a place to eat. I recommend some golden mash and golden pastries.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Get some energy stored up. Oni are greedier than any other creature, and there's no telling what they'll do.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
This might end up being a much longer fight than you're expecting.  
  
   
## Chase Battle: Drunkenness and Relaxation  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Bwahahaha!  
This is such fun! Such fun!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
It ain't fun for you!  
Your eyes aren't laughing at all!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
&ndash;Humph. Don't insult me.  
I'm just not used to laughing.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
To laugh from the bottom of one's heart, huh...  
I can't do it like Shuten.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She got away again...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But I could tell we were hitting her.  
We're wearing her down, I think.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's just stay calm and be careful.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's such a help that you're always calm.  
   
**Mash:**   
I-Is it? I'm glad...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're getting tired, though...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. We need to recover our strength as well.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's retreat a little and make camp.  
That should let us talk to the Doctor as well.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm... Got it. Thanks for the report.  
Just keep it up and don't let your guard down.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry. There's just so much static near the gate that I can't analyze anything or communicate with you.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
By the way... Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
How's Mash looking?  
Is she, um, drunk? (Psst psst)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's normal during battle.  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Is she? But...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Point to your side without saying a word)  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Dinner's ready, Senpai! We're having what Mr. Golden requested, golden rice balls.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Since we're on the battlefield, it's curry-flavored! Everyone loves curry! But unfortunately your fingers get a little sticky.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's only one way to deal with this.  
Open wide, Senpai!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Y-Yeah... The same, huh?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If she's normal during combat, and near that gate,  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
maybe she's just barely keeping it under control when she's near danger, perhaps?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She seems stronger during combat, actually.  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Is it the same as the way Kintoki said he's overflowing with power?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai...you're not going to eat it?  
You're not going to open wide?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
S-Sure!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sorry, I was frozen in joy!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm glad. Here, open up!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is it good? I've got more!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
W-Well, I'm just glad it's not interfering with the battle.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I don't know what's going on, but clearly, there's some kind of alcohol in the air there.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Until we can deal with the root cause, it won't go away.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You'll have to make the best of what you've got.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Oh, right. I did come up with a plan.  
Something I wanted you to try when you had the time...  
  
   
## Chase Battle: Alcoholic Fog in the Demonic Capital  
   
**Mash:**   
They got away again.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...No. Considering our injuries and fatigue&ndash;  
I guess we dealt a fair amount of damage.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What are you looking at, Mash?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If you're tired, you should rest.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
I was just thinking about what the Doctor said yesterday.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(So you were listening to our conversation?)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Our goal is to resolve whatever's causing the abnormalities that exist in this place.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At the moment, it's clear that our biggest problem is the oni that lives by this gate&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But maybe we don't necessarily have to defeat it.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
You want to turn a blind eye to it?  
That doesn't seem like a golden idea...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, I'm not saying we should turn a blind eye to it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But say that Ibaraki-Douji's power comes from this “source” beyond the gate&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In which case, it would make more sense to wipe that out first. That's what I meant.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
For instance, by climbing over the gate rather than under it. Or maybe we could find a way to go around it...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Ahh, so that's what you meant.  
Then your objective makes sense, but...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
We couldn't possibly climb over the gate.  
Look at its top.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. I did see that too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's a sinister, thick, fog-like, cloudy-looking something that's hanging over the gate and wall.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't know what it is, but I'm willing to bet it's something bad.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's no telling what it would do even to a Servant if they tried to touch it...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Looks like climbing over the gate is not possible...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master. Which is why I'd like to go scout a little and see if we can find a detour around it.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So how about finding a detour?  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master. Let's check the area again for possible detours before we stop to rest for the night.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Even if we can't climb over the gate or the enclosing fences, if there's some other path to the other side...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Maybe our prospects will look better...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...Doesn't seem like there's anything.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. Basically, it seems the heart of Kyoto is surrounded on all sides by that poisonous fog-looking substance.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That said... Now that we're seeing the west end of the city for the first time, I've just realized...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
There's a freakin' humongous cliff here for some reason. I almost can't believe it, but there it is.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
This era... I mean, this Japan right now, must have shrunken or something. Or should I say the islands have been squashed?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
The topography is crazy. Unexpectedly the ocean is up against Kyoto's west side...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Right. It does look like there's something like an island beyond that fog, but since we don't have a boat...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I don't dislike this golden sense of scale, though.  
But it looks like there's no way to make that detour.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're probably right. It seems... that we do need to beat Ibaraki-Douji in order to proceed.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It may be a tough fight, but let's give it our best shot.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master. Of course, we will. As poor as my abilities are, I will absolutely give it my utmost effort.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We can't give up now.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master. Of course, we won't.  
I have no intention of giving up.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As poor as my abilities are, I will absolutely give it my utmost effort.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Even so, Kyoto... this topography... It's just too different from the Japan we know...)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(What on earth is happening in this Japan?)  
  
   
## Chase Battle: The Circumstances of the Oni  
   
**Mash:**   
Again!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We were really trying not to let her escape this time too, but...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We just can't seem to make her stop!  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master.  
She retreats with astonishing agility.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Whenever I see her arm, I'm reminded against my will.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
When Tsuna's sword Higekiri chopped off her arm, she still escaped before he could deal the finishing blow.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
These aren't just flukes.  
It must be some kind of ability.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Maybe she has the “Disengage” skill.  
That would be very bothersome.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
By the way, Mr. Golden, what you just said makes me wonder something. Did you know her while you were alive too?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Only her battle habits. We fought quite a few times.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did you know the captured oni... Shuten-Douji, too?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Aaah, well, yeah.  
...She was the same as Ibaraki, I guess. Yeah.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Were the two of them friends?  
Or, were they more like boss and subordinate?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Ibaraki was the boss of all the oni on Mt. Ooe. Shuten also apparently lived there, as a freeloader&mdash;  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
But Ibaraki treated her as her superior, saying Shuten had something she lacked.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
In terms of ranking within the oni clan, they were equals. But that was based solely on Ibaraki's decree...which caused the kinds of problems you'd expect.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
But I do get where Ibaraki was coming from. That Shuten... She was, I guess you can say, a coward in a lot of ways.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
And she was wicked to the core. But she was honestly good to those she'd formed a kind of bond with.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I thought she was a spirit of caprice and mischief in the form of an oni, but she's also chivalrous, dutiful, and humane.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Yeah, she was a natural-born leader, that Shuten-Douji. Though she caused plenty of trouble for her subordinates.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see, I see.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
And just what the hell are you smiling about, huh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I beg your pardon. You just seemed oddly gentle while you were saying all that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But that boss oni is now being held prisoner by Ibaraki-Douji.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She seemed to be completely out cold too.  
I wonder what happened...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...Who knows? Maybe Ibaraki finally ran out of patience with her.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Oni will always be demonic.  
And I'll hunt them down. That's all there is to it.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I'm heading out. If you all want to rest, then go on and rest already.  
  
   
## Chase Battle: Shuten's Memories  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Fufu. Just what are you staring at, boy?  
Well, not that it's any bother to me to be stared at.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...I'm not staring. You're standing where I'm facing.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Fufu. What a mean human you are...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Now, shall we begin? I've lost count of how many times we've clashed at this point.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
My signature weapon is lacking its best bits...  
Would you forgive me?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
If it were to clash head-on with that battle-axe of yours, it'd be such exquisite fun, such exquisite pleasure...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
I'm not fond of pointless battle, you see.  
I'll take you down with sensuality, not by brute force.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
But, well, we're only in this situation because it doesn't seem to work on you, right?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Oh dear, oh dear. If I can't de-bone you with desire for me without lopping off your head, I'll lose self-confidence.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
But I suppose it's hopeless.  
After all... you like fighting way more, isn't that right?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
&mdash;It is.  
That's what I want. That's all I need.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Oni are evil. That's what you are to me, Shuten.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
So you say. But I thought I saw you take pity on another oni before me and let her slip away?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Really, I'm quite furious now.  
De-boning you won't be enough to satisfy me.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
That's it! I'll rip out your bones and then use my metal rod to torment you. And with that, we'll erase all the history we've shared till now.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...That dream just now...  
   
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
&mdash;Tch.  
Did I wake you? Sorry.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I let my guard down too. I dozed off and you saw a pathetic comedy from long ago.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
But yeah... I've crossed paths with Shuten a number of times.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
When we've fought for real, we always end in a draw. When we've sparred for fun or for a bet, we always end in a draw.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I guess we'd both got it in our heads that we'd found an opponent we were dead even with...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Boss Raikou called me out on it, asked what I thought I was doing, striking up a rivalry with an oni.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Boss was the one who served Shuten drugged wine, which put all the oni to sleep.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
You know how the rest of the story goes. I snuck up behind Shuten as she slept and decapitated her.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
And yet, that wretch...  
Even as she was dying, she gave me a little grin.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
“Guess I'll go a bit ahead of you, 'kay?” she murmured. Like she was enjoying her life to the very last.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...Jeez. She really was quite a woman, actually.  
Even now, that never felt like a victory to me.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
And, so... That's why I can't stomach the idea that she is being controlled by Ibaraki now.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I'll take on Ibaraki since she's an oni, but as a victim of Shuten's annoying antics, I can't ignore this.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
At the end, I'm just venting my own anger!  
You don't need to worry about it, Master.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
This fight is finally drawing to a close.  
It's time I gave her a proper thrashing!  
  
   
## Chase Battle: Ibaraki's Obstinacy  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Urgh... Arrgh!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
It's a bitter pill to swallow, isn't it, Boss-Lady?  
Time to pay the toll!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
...Not...not yet.  
  
   
Do you think I am so easily slain!?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
You should know better than that, you fool!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
No matter how many swords pierce us, no matter how many spears impale us...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
We do not stop.  
Not until we've had our fill.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
We are the apex of this filthy existence... and, because we continually devour the souls of others, the embodiment of life!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
That&ndash;is what an oni truly is!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh... This heat...!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
My Inferno Fist has obliterated entire armies&mdash;  
May it burn the flesh from your bones!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
&mdash;Blaze, Sougenbi!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Hot! Hot, hot, hot!  
Are you trying to burn yourself up too, bastard?!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Her Noble Phantasm's deployed!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Whew. We managed to defend ourselves through that attack, but... it looks like Ibaraki-Douji got away.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can't believe she could summon up so much latent power...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Yeah, that was basically her last rally.  
She won't be able to summon any more of those flames.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
She saves that Noble Phantasm for last, not to destroy her opponent, but to give her cover under which she can run away.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
That's why she can't win against Shuten.  
She acts like a ruffian, but deep down, she's submissive.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ahh. Well, then... What about Shuten?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
She's the exact opposite of Ibaraki. She looks refined on the surface, but she's a true oni inside.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
But never mind that now.  
We're finally close to finishing this, Boss.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Agreed. We've all been pushing through our accumulating fatigue...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah. Stay on your guard. Let's go.  
   
**Mash:**   
Right. After all these battles, I know all too well how terrifying oni can be.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Let's win this thing.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master. Of course we will.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's take this time to prepare ourselves fully and go into battle in our best possible condition.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Everything we've done will be for tomorrow's decisive battle&ndash;  
  
   
## Showdown: Defeating the Oni  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Now get blown away! Eat this&ndash;  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Golden Spark!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
   
Urghh, aaaaaauuughhhh!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We... We did it!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She had so much stamina I wondered if it was inexhaustible, but...at last! That was a fatal hit!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Why? Why were you able to follow me this far?!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I stand above all the oni! Humans should not be able to slay me, even if you are Heroic Spirits!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Don't be ridiculous, Ibaraki.  
You're not above anything.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
You're just a child pretending to be.  
You lacked the guts you needed to the very end.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
How dare you! How could any part of me be deemed lacking!?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
You really need someone to spell it out for you? I guess you do. Okay, Boss, would you kindly enlighten her?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Basically, you never ate Shuten, did you?  
   
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Hargh&mdash;!?  
Y-You miserable human!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
How could you utter such a cruel suggestion!?  
Eat Shuten? I only said that in a hypothetical sense!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
And you took it literally... Do I really seem like someone who could eat Shuten!?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I respect Shuten and haven't hurt so much as a hair upon her head, you fools! In the first place, I'd be too afraid to! She'd slaughter me!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
See? Told you this was how Ibaraki was, right?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, she's not so...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What a chicken...  
   
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Y-You little wretch, I don't know what you called me, but I can sense that it was some kind of dreadful insult. Wasn't it, human!?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
What part of me do you dare to call weak!?  
Speak your name, knave!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's Fujimaru.  
   
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
All right, I've memorized it. I've memorized your name, human! I shall curse it to the end of time! Writhe in mortal terror!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Saying all that was perhaps a bit counter-productive... All the terror I felt for you before has been reversed. Right, Senpai?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Even the black-clad one is...  
Why? Why do you not fear me!?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Jeez, you're actually pretty funny.  
Especially because your speech is so melodramatic!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I-I can hardly help that!  
It is the custom of oni to speak in this way!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Oni must be proud at all times, even in the way we speak! That's what my mother taught me!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Right, that's great.  
Just go on preserving those proud oni customs then.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
That's an oni's strong point and pride, isn't it?  
All right, what was this whole farce about?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
You capture an oni despite being an oni yourself, then serve humans alcohol hoping we'll self-destruct?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
That's not like you at all. It's because you drink more than you can handle. So go wash your face and come back again.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Ulp, gulp!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
All right, then. I acknowledge it was my loss this time! And I'll acknowledge you humans' so-called guts!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
But my horns remain unbroken! So next time you insult me, I will make you regret it deeply!  
  
   
## Conclusion: Awakening From a Drunken Dream  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Ibaraki-Douji has retreated.  
We've won, Master!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, I can confirm it here!  
It was the first time we tried it, so I'm glad it worked!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But the comms are still messed up.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm seeing a tiny Servant response in front of you...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm pretty sure it's just static, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No. That's not static, Doctor.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
...Mmm. Fwah?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sh-She woke up, Senpai!  
But she's an oni just like Ibaraki-Douji&mdash;  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Yup. Time for round two, huh?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Mnnyaah... Mmm? Mmmm?  
...Ooohh!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Is that you, boy?  
It's been forever. How've you been?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
! EAT THIS!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
K-Kintoki!? You're just attacking without warning!?  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sh-She stopped his axe at the last second.  
She didn't even try to dodge&ndash;  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Oh my. Such passion!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Jumping me as I get up... fufu.  
You must be about ready to explode, huh?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
I don't mind.  
You're as handsome as ever, and it would wake me up.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Hey... What happened to you?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
What do you mean? I'm me, aren't I?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
My pale skin, my swelling breasts, my voluptuous behind... They're all like you remember, right?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
&mdash;Want to take a closer look?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I-I do not! Why don't you have any shame?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Golden... Were you two in a relationship?  
   
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I'm always a victim!  
And she's like this with everybody!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
More importantly!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
You're a greater oni than Ibaraki, so how'd you wind up looking just like an ordinary girl!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. The power I sense from her is very weak.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Oh, you're right.  
I was wondering where all my strength had gone.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Looks like most of my power got absorbed by Ibaraki. Oh dear. That shouldn't be possible, huh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Do you remember...what happened?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
A little. So I know you tried really hard to save me, didn't you, boy?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I did not! You were just a bonus!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Fufu. I was only half-awake, but I got to feel like a trapped princess.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
It was a new experience... I liked it.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Oh, right. A rescued princess is supposed to thank you, isn't she? ...How about a kiss of gratitude? Come on...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
SPA&mdash;RK!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He jumped back fast!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Aww, you're no fun.  
You didn't have to run away.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Shuten-Douji, right?  
I'd like an explanation as to what's going on here.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Fair enough. I guess I can't spend all my time playing with the boy. ...I'll take you there. Follow me.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Look, this is what you're searching for, isn't it?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Holy Grail...or at least, something that looks very similar!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm sure of it.  
What you're looking at is the root cause of all this!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It seems filled with some kind of fluid. That's...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
I just woke up here with Ibaraki somehow, and this thing was right in front of us.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
And it was filled with delicious wine.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um... You didn't.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Yup. I drank it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Something so obviously suspicious?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I don't want to ask, but why?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
That's just who she is.  
I bet Ibaraki didn't want to, though.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Of course, Ibaraki was scared. She said it was a bad idea to eat things you find on the ground.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
But when I asked her if it she was too good for my wine, she gave in and drank it down with tears in her eyes.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ibaraki...  
You should've been nicer to her...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
And then after I drank for a while, I got sleepy.  
And then I woke up like this.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Ibaraki absorbed my power, and I became a trapped princess, and the boy came after my body and soul...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I did not!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I see. But in the end, you don't know what this is either?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
No, I don't, but I do know this: this is wine and I drank it.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
And you know how it ended up, right? So the answer is plain. This is&ndash;wine that grants wishes.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wine poured into a Grail... Its role as an omnipotent wish granter activated... But is that really possible?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Come to think of it, I've been hearing someone's voice for a while.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
I thought maybe I was just drunk... Is it an onmyouji?  
He sounds like a wimp... Well, it doesn't matter.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Just so you're clear, this wine doesn't grant the wish itself.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
It grants the wish in your heart, but&ndash;it twists it first.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Wine makes you drunk, and leads to bewilderment... Maybe that's why. That's what makes it fun, though.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see&ndash;which means that wine vaporized and spread through the air,  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
and made all the normal people who couldn't fight it “drunk.”  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's why everyone in the Kyoto area was acting so strangely.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Some people can handle their drink better than others. I'm glad Fujimaru was okay...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...By the way, Mash.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What would you do if a paper plane flew towards Fujimaru right now?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Say it was a paper plane thrown by the world champion paper plane thrower with a world record on the line.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's quite an undertaking... A new world record must involve a lot of suffering and drama, I assume.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But I would immediately deploy my Noble Phantasm. Senpai's safety is my first priority.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(...Mash is tipsy too.)  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait a second. Does that mean it's not just humans who get drunk here...but Servants too?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
I think so. Ibaraki's wish was probably to go on a rampage with me...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
But that got twisted into going on a rampage with my power.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not being affected, so it's okay...  
But what about Mr. Golden?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
My wish...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Come to think of it, you said you felt a lot stronger.  
Was that it?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Oh&mdash;you wished for the same thing, huh?  
Did you want to play with me that much?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
To hit each other with our exposed parts, staring into each other's eyes, moaning like beasts&ndash;  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
N-No! A-Are you stupid or something? Of course not!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Sorry... I can't take you up on that offer the way I am right now.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
But you worked some of that out with Ibaraki, right?  
I guess you ended up with the wrong girl.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Now then, I remember the kind of wine I drank, so&mdash;  
Let's smash it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right. This thing is the cause of it all anyway.  
We can't end this unless we destroy it.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...Hey.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
What?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
You... What was your wish?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
...Fufu. What do you think?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Tch. Hell if I know.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
You're worried about me, aren't you? You're so cute... Both your body and your soul.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
I like to mess around&mdash;but I especially like men who only have one love.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
It's a shame to get rid of this wine...  
But I guess we don't have a choice.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
This wine makes you drunk on your own wishes.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
And when you're drunk, things always seem twisted. This time it was especially bad. It twists you, yourself.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
This goes for Ibaraki too, but I've been far too twisted.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
I've got no power, I can't eat people, I can't attack the boy... I'm just a little girl. This isn't me.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
So I can't drink it down.  
I can't just doze and enjoy the wine.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
No matter how much I've longed to see what I see when I open my eyes&mdash;  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
This is just&mdash;a dream, brought on by too much drinking.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
And now it's time to wake up.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh&ndash; Yes! We did it!  
The cause of the abnormality is gone!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Now that I'm awake...  
It's time to go get drunk again.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Once I am, I won't let you get away, boy.  
I swear&ndash;I'll pay you back for last time.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
And then you can pour me drinks as part of my harem of hotties... Fufu...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
See you around.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
She looked so satisfied as she disappeared...  
What did she want, anyway?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not sure, but I think I can guess.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I think maybe since you were worried about her so much...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She brought you here so she could laugh and tell you not to worry?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...Tch. What the heck?  
That just makes me worry more.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...Man, this ain't golden at all.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...Anyway, looks like my role here's done.  
I might see you guys again somewhere, though.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Just be careful.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Not all the mysteries have been solved.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She said that there was a cup filled with wine placed in front of her. Which means&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Who put the cup there&ndash;  
And who filled it with wine?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...Who knows? If there was somebody behind it, this ain't over yet. Something else will happen.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
But this is all for now. The oni of Rashomon are gone.  
So I'm leaving.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There are no Servants left.  
We can assume we're finished here.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good work, Mash.  
Good work, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. Let's head back to Chaldea, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
(Staring)

**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is it, Mash?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm sorry. I was a little curious what would happen if you were to get drunk...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, if you'd like, I'd be happy to have some alcohol with you after dinner.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's fine. I probably won't get drunk.  
I've learned that this time.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well? Well? Will you drink with me? This is a chance to let me see a side of you I don't usually get to see.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash, are you still drunk?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Someone bring water!  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Um, guys. I'll say one thing that's important.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...No drinking until you're of legal age!
