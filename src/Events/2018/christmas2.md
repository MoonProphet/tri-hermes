# The Little Santa Alter - Christmas 2018  
  
## 1st Night: What Ever Happened to Jeanne?  
   
**Narration:**   
The waves crashed and roared.  
The violent winds howled.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It may not have been alive, but for all its ferocity, it may as well have been.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Somehow, it was as frightening as the beginning of the world, but as beautiful as the end of all things.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
A gift that, supposedly, was never meant to be, was being opened before my eyes.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...In the end, I was probably a failure as Santa.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
That's why I'm sure these tears are tears of frustration.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
There was a hole in my heart.  
And what filled it was&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, are you ready to go?  
That reindeer outfit really suits you!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks.  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, you forgot something important.  
Here, your red nose.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is that a compliment?  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes! Of course!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
I have sort of a care package for you from all the Servants.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We expect you to be out for a while, so please take it with you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
First... This is a portable heater.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You'll be flying at over 7,500 meters, so this will make sure you don't get cold.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's made with Medea's magecraft, so it will definitely keep you warm!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How helpful!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And this is a lunch from Emiya.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If you pull this string, it will automatically warm up.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He developed it together with Edison, or so he said...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, the one flaw is that it emits a strong smell of dumplings, so be careful when you eat it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Rocket dumplings...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And this is from Marie.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
“It's a little early for Christmas, but this is warm spiced wine,” she says.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
“I'll put it in an insulated case, so drink it when you find yourself getting cold.”  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This is all so thoughtful...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And lastly, Senpai, this is from Santa Alter and me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's a talisman we made together. It's meant to give many effects, such as safe travelling...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At least, I hope it does.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, and I have a message from Santa Alter.  
“You'd better not make her cry,” she says.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hehehe, I guess Santa Alter is kind of worried.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This year's Christmas is going to be a little bit... crazy...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But I'm sure you'll make it work.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I need to undergo emergency maintenance, so I'm staying here with the doctor...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But I'll be monitoring you carefully!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So um... If you would contact me too, that would make me happy.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Roger!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right! Goodbye, Master!  
Be careful!  
  
   
**???:**  
All right, it's time for Reindeer Master to head out!  
Let's go!  
  
   
**???:**  
It is pretty cold outside, but we'll be fine!  
  
   
**???:**  
Because I, Jeanne d'Arc Alter, am Santa!  
  
   
**???:**  
It's extremely logistical! I mean, logical!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay...what the actual hell?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, let me start from the beginning&mdash;  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Time for you to learn a lesson...  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Oh, Jeanne! Why are you summoning me at this late hour?  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
If you wish to do a ritual of dark magecraft, can't it wait till morning?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
No, no, no. Definitely not.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I don't care about those weird rituals.  
I don't even think they work.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You know... It's almost time, right?  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Time for what?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
All the younger Servants are starting to get excited.  
I mean, so are the adults.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Why are they getting all excited for? Can you even call that candy-loving book a legendary hero who left a mark on history?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Ugh... Those so-called “real Servants” are satisfied with merely existing, and not at all interested in bettering themselves.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
According to Master, someone once said that anyone without a desire to improve is an idiot.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I don't know who it was, but it's a great saying worthy of a Jeanne Alter gold star.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Haha, you're getting off track, Jeanne.  
So, will you tell me what it's time for?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Ahem.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Basically, it's almost Christmas.  
Doesn't it piss you off to see them in high spirits?  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
No, not at all.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
On the contrary, when I see the children get excited, it makes me want to smile.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Though for reasons I can't quite understand, my smile seems to frighten children!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...I see now what a stupid question that was.  
Also, those kids are right to run away.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Anyways, listen.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
When Christmas comes, she starts getting excited.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Who is “she”?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Don't you know?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That awful, dark Santa with the skin the color of a corpse!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Last time I was just walking through the halls when I almost got blown away!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
“You aren't looking where you're going, fallen saint. Can't you tell I'm in the middle of tuning my Llamrei Mark II?”  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
“Of course you can! It's almost Christmas! It's almost time for Christmas fun. My sword shall save the world once more!”  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
She said it twice! She just wouldn't shut up!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
And then she went into the combat simulator and started humming “Jingle Bells” while blasting off her Noble Phantasm for hours before finally going home.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
(Is my Jeanne stalking Santa...?)  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Can't you see? She's much too merry to be a proper Santa.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
So I'm going to steal&ndash;ahem, borrow&ndash;Santa Alter's sack.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
What? The sack she uses to carry presents!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That's right. And then I'm going to hand them out before she can.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
The children will cry. Santa Alter will cry.  
It will be my best Christmas ever!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Do you see now, the genius of my plan?  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
But, my Jeanne...  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
If I may point out, even if it is the middle of the night, she is still a Servant.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
And we do not even have Presence Concealment.  
Won't it be quite difficult to steal from her?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hmph. You underestimate me, Gilles!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Don't worry! The cute little kiddie King of Heroes gave me a potion that makes you invisible!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Ooh! So that the pitch-black potion you've been holding...!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Yep. I'll turn invisible, steal her sack, and then spend the whole night delivering presents! It's foolproof.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
And tomorrow, when the children are happily opening their presents, I will feast on the sweet salt of Santa Alter's tears&mdash;  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
SERVES YOU RIGHT!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
What a beautiful, perfect plan!  
So all you have to do is drink that potion, my Jeanne!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Yep! All that's left is to drink this potion, Gilles! That's...all...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
How strange. I'm suddenly a little...nervous for some reason...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
It should be safe, right? I was careful not to ask the scary evil Gilgamesh and chose the dumb kid, as a precaution.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Yes! I have no reason to be confident about that, but I am willing to bet your life on it!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Gilles, feel free not to say everything that comes to mind.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
But that's fine. If I stopped to worry about consequences, I wouldn't be a Servant.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I am the witch of vengeance. Even if I've been tricked into taking poison, I'll still laugh and gulp it down.  
All the potion. All of it.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Well, bottoms up!  
(Swallow)  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Ugh! This tastes awful!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
They say good medicine is bitter, Jeanne.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Right, right. So? Am I turning invisible?  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
No, not really.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Grr. I knew he tricked me. Well, then I'll just go STEAL the real thing from&mdash; Ack, gah!?  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
What's wrong, Jeanne?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
M-my body is on fire...Gyaaaahh!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Oh no, not again! Jeanne! Jeanne!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
JEEEAAANNE!!!  
  
   
**???:**  
Hey, you're being real loud, Mr. Gilles de Rais!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**B：???:**  
Hmph. Trying to turn invisible to stir up trouble.  
The grown-up me is awful, huh?  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Eh? Eh? Eh?  
  
   
**B：???:**  
But I respect her desire to want to be Santa!  
I shall carry on her will!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Wait... Wait... Are you...!  
  
   
**???:**  
I am Jeanne Alter Lily.  
I was born to become the next Santa!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Oh, Jeanne... Jeanne...!  
You have turned into a child too adorable by far...!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my! I'm so excited I seem to have ascended! Prelati would be delighted!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Anyway, the grown-up me is a dummy to think I could steal by turning invisible.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Oh? So you have a plan, sweet young Jeanne?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
A plan? Mr. Gilles, are you stupid?  
I don't need a plan!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I'm just gonna convince Miss Altria Santa that I'm the better Santa!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Ooh! Even in youth my Jeanne was so very reckless!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Nothing good will come of this, but she may at least learn a life lesson...!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...?  
Off I go!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Oh, you stay here, Mr. Gilles de Rais. You sneaking into a woman's room at night is bad, bad, bad!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
What'd'yuh mean you wannnabe Santa? ChristmasSwordOfPromised-calibur!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Huh? Did that voice sound younger or something&mdash;  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Meh, whatever. Bedtime... Zzz...  
Get lots of sleep f' Christmas...  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Ooh, Jeanne!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
She's the sort who may bite if you get too close!  
Well, she may bite whether you're close or not!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Perhaps the reason you failed was that you approached unguarded. Oh, how sad...!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Why didn't you tell me before!?  
She was scary! She was really, really scary!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
Nuh-uh, I'm not crying!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Bulging-eyed Gilles... What is the meaning of your intrusion at this hour?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
The Servants are one thing, but Master and the staff are sleeping.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
If you want to make noise, do it when everyone is awake&mdash;  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
The properly grown-up me! It's Regular Adult Me!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I see. That explains why Adult-Me is all panicking and stuff.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
But this year, Santa's job will be miiiiiine!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Gilles?  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Wh-what is it, Jeanne?  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Is it just my imagination, or is your smile a little more strained than usual?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
How could it not be strained?  
Now, tell me what's going on!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
If you don't tell me everything, I will poke those googly eyes right out!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...And that's what happened.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What? Just... What?  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
You don't seem very calm, my Master.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
If you're my Master, you need to be composted and remain calm at all times!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I see... So they multiplied again...  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Hey, Master. What's that attitude for!?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
That's right, Master.  
Multiplying like bunnies is Altria's thing.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Me multiplying is an exception to all exceptions!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry. May I ask your name and class once more?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Of course. I am...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
“Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily Lancer!”  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
One more time, faster.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
F-faster? All right.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
“Jeanned'ArcSantaAlterLilySanta”!  
Huh? Waaait a minute... Um...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
“SantaJeanneAlterd'ArcLily”!  
No... Um...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
“ShantaJantaLilyncer”!  
Huh Um... Hmm... Um... Well...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Master, please don't tease her too much.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Tease me...? M-Master, what are you? A kid!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I think I see what's going on.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Jeanne Alter has become Lily. And the cause is the young Gilgamesh's potion. Am I correct?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
I'm really sorry!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're not even kind of sorry, are you?  
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Nope. She woke me up in the middle of the night.  
Not my fault I grabbed the wrong potion!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
It wasn't deliberate. It was an innocent mistake.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Forgiven.  
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Thanks!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
...Well, if I were to make an excuse, it was because I was woken up at night and I grabbed the wrong thing.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Maybe I shouldn't have opened the door to my treasure vault while I was still lying on the floor.  
  
   
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
That was very careless of you, Gil!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Hahaha. I never thought I'd see the day Jeanne Alter had a good reason to yell at me.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Adult-Me is a good-for-nothing!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I&ndash;she is not that bad...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Deep down, she has the potential to become a proud Servant...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
The way the other me spoils me is the reason why I think of things like trying to steal sacks!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...I see. So this is what that weirdo looked like before she grew up.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Miss Calls-Herself-a-Holy-Maiden, Master, come with me. I need to talk to you.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I've never called myself anything like that!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Mash, you play with her for a while.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I'm too old to play.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
More importantly, Miss Altria Santa, give me Santa's sack&mdash;  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Just play. Or you get the naughtygirl-calibur.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Whaaaaaa!?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...Heh.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
I-I don't think Santa should be threatening people! (Shaking)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Should I call you Jeanne Alter Santa Lily?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Or maybe something shorter? A nickname...?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Jeanne Alter is fine. Or Santa Jeanne.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Then for now, I'll call you Jeanne Alter.  
Why do you want to be Santa Claus?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Because I'd be the best Santa ever, duh!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I can do a much better job of delivering the proper, ideal presents for everyone.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The proper presents...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I do remember Emiya's unreadable expression upon receiving Black Keys last year...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
What's an Archer gonna do with Black Keys, anyway? That's why she's bad! Bad! Bad! Bad!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Good point.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I know most of what happened last Christmas from grown-up me's memories.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I know I can give better presents, and that everyone will love them!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Heh. Listen to you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Welcome back, Master. Is something wrong?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nothing.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm back.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Wh-what is it, Miss Altria Santa?  
Is it another-calibur? Whatcha-calibur again?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
D-do it, if you dare!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
You are not fooling anyone, talking tough while hiding behind Master.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...But we talked, and I've decided that you can be Santa this year.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Take this. This is Santa's secret sack.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I-it's okay? Really?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Well, if you don't want to, I'll just be Santa again.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
N-no! I'll do it! I'll do it!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Reindeer, this year will be different than last.  
You take the lead.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
What you do is no different from last year. Gather the stockings that are the crystallizations of children's hearts.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Babysitting will be an extra task, but you can do it.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
What!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Th-that sounds like I'm just some useless kid!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
Take that back! I demand a reduction!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm counting on you.  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I guess I have to babysit Master, then.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Fine. I'm gonna lead the Reindeer to the best Christmas ever!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's do our best, Santa Claus.  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Do our best? There's no need to work that hard.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Hehehe. Why, you ask? Because my plan is perfect!  
  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
(I have a bad feeling about this, but hang in there, Reindeer. Fujimaru is the only one who can control her.)  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Consider this a request from me as well, Master.  
Please, make Lily into a great Santa...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm on it.  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Thank you...!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I know this should be obvious, but Alter Lily is also a different being than myself.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Please treat her as a full-fledged Servant.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll try.  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Heh. That's the answer of one who knows what [♂ he /♀ she]'s doing.  
  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
All right, I'll start by testing your power.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Santa, Jr., Fujimaru.  
We'll start with Santa warm-ups.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Santa needs an iron will, an icy heart, and the fury of a demon! Fight without fear!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
To the combat simulator, right?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Don't worry. I'll show you my powers as a Santa Servant.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Very well. I will be your opponent, Santa, Jr.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
A-already!? Uuhhh...  
Wait! I'm not ready&mdash;  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
There's no use arguing! I shall test you to see if you're a Santa worthy of my Reindeer!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
You passed. Barely. But, I suppose I must give you my secret sack.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Now, Reindeer. Work hard so you don't tarnish the Santa name.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Th-that was scary... That was real scary...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Are you okay? It looked like you were maybe crying a little, Jeanne Alter...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
No, I wasn't crying! There's no crying in Santa Claus!  
It's a Class that delivers smiles!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Anyways, old Santa gave me her blessing.  
Now let's go deliver preseeents!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Huh? It's still early?  
What are you saying, Reindeer?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
You know how the song goes!  
“Santa baby, hurry down...”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
V-very well, but we have to prepare, so hold on a little bit!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It may not be winter yet, but it is late fall. There might already be snow falling in some places.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We should at least get some winter equipment ready!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Anyway, that's enough reminiscing.  
Time to get going, Reindeer!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
There are Servants waiting for us to give them their presents!  
  
   
## 2nd Night: The Gift of the Fool  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Have you heard of the story called  
“The Gift of the Magi,” Reindeer?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Personally, the truly moving moment kinda falls flat!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Hair can grow out, but the special family watch is gone forever!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
From the way the story goes, the husband prolly won't be getting a new watch.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
And every time the wife uses the combs, she'd feel real bad, and every time the husband see the combs, he'd feel kinda dumb.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
And that's bad. 'Course they wanted to be nice, but their gifts didn't make them magi, they made them dummies!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Yes, that's why this is the perfect present for her.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Hum, hum, hum. Hum, hum, huuuum.  
Hum, hum, hum... Hum, hummmm♪  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Slashing through the night, and tearing through the sky♪ This is how Santa should be!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You look like you're having fun.  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Fun... N-no. This is work! It's real work!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Singing is part of Santa's job!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What a pretty voice.  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Pretty...  
Rei... Reindeer, you've sure got an eye for talent!  
  
   
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
In any event, the first request will be... from Jea... Jean...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jing Ke.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I-I know that!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Last year's request was for a dagger with a sharp blade, but she instead got an “elegant older gentleman”...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
What's an “elegant older gentleman”?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A classy old guy who got murderified.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I don't really get it, but that's not a good present for Jean Kay!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I have the bestest present for her, so let's head towards the caves!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
So, how do you get down there, anyways...?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Again. We're doing this. Again. This year!?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
It's fine. It's fine. How about a drink, Martha?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
And this year Ushiwakamaru is drunk, too...  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
No, no, no, no. I am not all at drunk.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Yooou...shall not pass.  
(Talking to a Jizo statue)  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Stop talking nonsense.  
We only need one person who talks like that.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Maaarrrthaaa!  
Make me your Steel Fist Yukhoe, Yukhoe&mdash;!  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Use your fists! Smash the meat! You know, the thing that magically tastes better that way!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Okay. Fine. You two are a pain this year, too!  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
But Christmas is so much fun.  
Why didn't you tell me last year?  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Hey, Martha. Hey. Hey. Hey.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
It's just pains in the butt all over the place!  
I thought this might happen!  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Booooooo...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Jing Ke! Do you have any other requests?  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Hmm?  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
I have plenty of alcohol, so just Yukhoe will be fine! (Belch)  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Oh, oh! Over here! Over here! I have a request.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Sure, what is it?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I'd like a crockpot. Would that be okay?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
A crockpot?  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
What is a crockpot? Is it for crocodiles?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
No, I was hoping to make some soft-shell turtle soup.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh, turtle soup...  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Turtle soup, huh!?  
That sounds good! That will invigorate you!  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
We can always make our Master eat it!  
It'll be one wild night!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Well unfortunately, I didn't procure any soft-shell turtles.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Why would you need to be invigorated on such a holy day?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Sure, I can see you celebrating a bit, but more than anything it is a time for reverence and&mdash;  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Hahahahaha, what are you saying, Martha?  
There's a huge turtle right here.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
   
That's Tarasque! Tarasque!!  
  
   
**G：Tarasque:**   
(You need to... pick better friends...)  
↑Said while trembling like a soaked, frightened puppy   
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Hey, Ushiwakamaru.  
Don't you feel bad for Tarasque?  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Besides, no way a turtle this big would taste good!  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Hmm... Then how about giving it a try?!  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Hahahahaha! Tarasque soup! Tarasque soup!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Do you see this, Reindeer?  
Look at these weirdos...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This is a terrifying scene...  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
All the adults are ganging up on that poor turtle.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
It's like a scene from hell.  
This is bad... This is real, real bad.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This is so terrible in so many ways...  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Yeah, I feel bad for Tarasque, but seeing grown-ups acting like this...!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Santa Alter told me what happened last year, but...  
This is far worse than I heard...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh, Santa and Reindeer.  
You came again? So soon?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Yes! We're here! And just like last year you're all sooo baaad!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
You're all getting ingrate... inebred... Drunk!  
Drunk in a cave! And you call yourselves adults!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Come onnn! Are you dummies!?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Weren't you taller last year?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
H-hey! Don't pick on me!  
I'm going to grow! I'm GONNA get taller!  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Whaat? Santa?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Eek!  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Oh, Santa's here again!  
Come, come. Have a drink.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Jing Ke, Santa's scared and hiding. That's no good.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
We need to smoke her out. Like a mole.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
If you want to chop off the head of every soldier in a fortress, it's best to just burn it down.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
So, let's burn everything!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
R-Reindeer! Reindeer!?  
Ushiwakamaru is scaring me!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
This is why I hate drunk people!  
This isn't Christmas at all!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's punish them.  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Punishment... What a spirited idea...  
I mean, splendid idea.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Brother would just put his trembling fingers up his brow in frustration...  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
But my sister-in-law, Masako. Wow, was she strict.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
If one didn't continuously demonstrate great martial might and feats of strength, she might take their head at any moment.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Punishment. That is good.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
But if you don't give me a good punishment, I, Ushiwakamaru, shall bite back without hesitation!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's punch 'em till they straighten out.  
   
**Martha:**   
Let your fists do the talking... That sounds nice.  
But we are an all-girls club.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Out of respect for our friendship, I shall be on their side! Also, I'll make sure you forget everything while I'm at it, Master.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
It would be awkward next time we saw each other. Right?  
  
   
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Ha. A fight? Yeah! I can do that!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Come on, Reindeer, give me your orders!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
When I win, make sure you praise me a lot!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The sad drunk girls' party is coming this way!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
(Panting) W-we won!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You were great, Santa!  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Yes, I am the bestest Santa!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're cute.  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Cu...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
N-N-NO! I'm not! I'm not!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
You can praise me as much as you want, but for being the best Santa!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
No calling me cute! No, no, no! Boo...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Thank you...  
  
   
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Oh man, we lost! It's lose even if you drunk while you're fun!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
(Sigh) That didn't sober them up at all...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Anyways, here's your presents, weird ladies!  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Ahahahaha. What's this? (Gulp, gulp)  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Some sort of new alcohol? (Gulp, gulp)  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
This tastes funny... (Gulp, gulp)  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
It's a detoxifier.  
  
   
**All Three:**   
What.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Servants shouldn't be getting drunk!  
That's bad, that's real bad.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
This medicine...is so you always keep your sense of duty as a Servant.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Oh, please do be careful. It also means if you drink any alcohol you'll take damage.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Th-that can't be!  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
I can't drink? Wh-what's the point in living now...?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Darn it... I see. So that's where this was going...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Whew. Did you see how great the presents I gave them this year were?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Things were finally about to get really wild and fun...  
It's going to be tough being sober on Christmas.  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Oh my. I can't use alcohol as an excuse to do things anymore...  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
(Glance)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
What's wrong, Reindeer?  
Your face is all red...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What's wrong, Master?  
Did something happen, Master?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is there a reason to lock eyes with Mata Hari, Master!?  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Hehehehe.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Umm, Santa. You didn't make this medicine... Did you?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
No, I didn't know how, so I had a Caster make it. I don't know who he was but he wore white clothes&mdash;  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Did he have long hair? It was long hair, wasn't it? Hahahahaha, let's go stab him. Stabbity stab stab!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I shall accompany you to the very gates of hell!  
Haha, hahaha, hahahahaha...!  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
I think I'll come along, too.  
Martha, you handle the rest.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
What do you mean, handle the rest&mdash;  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Okay, let's head to the next one, Reindeer!  
It smells like alcohol here, and it's making me dizzy...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Okay, you. Wait juuust one second. (Grab)  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
Gah.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
Wh-what is it?! I'm Santa! I'm busy!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
You already got your present! Lemme go!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I need to talk to you.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Call me Santa!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Okay, okay. Santa, Santa.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Now. What were you thinking when you chose those presents?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
What I was thinking... I wanted to pick something that would be good for them.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Hmm... I think Christmas presents are more about making people happy than being practical.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
The celebration of Christmas began as an opportunity to celebrate His birth.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
It's not about having a good gift, but rather about making someone happy... Don't you think?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Nope!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
If Christmas is a day of blessing, then giving a useful gift is important.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...It's true everyone might not be happy with my gift, but...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
If it ends up being useful, then their happiness really isn't that important. That's what I think.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Hmm, I see. I suppose that way of thinking is&mdash;  
  
   
**Martha:**   
It makes sense, but...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Reindeer, can I leave the rest to you?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, I got this.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Understood. That's all from me.  
I thank you for your present.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Good luck, Santa.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Haha, yesss!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Okay, let's go deliver our next present, Reindeer!  
  
   
## 3rd Night: We are Middle Schoolers  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Okay, let's get going, Reindeer!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Time to deliver some good, practical presents for the good Servants of Japan!  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
...Is it time yet?  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Hmph, Lord Amakusa. What is Fuuma waiting for?  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Ah... He requested a present from Santa Claus.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Hahaha! I see! I see!  
Even the leader of the Fuuma Clan is still human, eh?  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
I thought ninja were just puppets on strings without human emotions. Man, that's so cute!  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
We Servants find our psychological ages strongly affected by our physical bodies.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
A 15 year-old body means his mind has regressed to that of a 15-year-old.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Indeed. Memories of our older selves often feel like it's somebody else's business.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Servants are such strange beings.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
But Lord Amakusa, is this “Santa Claus” really real? Handing out presents sounds like the work of a celestial maiden.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Yes, that's exactly right. But word from [♂ him /♀ her] is that there's a bit of a problem this year...  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Oh? A problem?  
That sounds interesting. What is it&mdash;  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
They're here!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Thanks for waiting! You must be Fuuma Kotarou!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily has arrived!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see all the Servants of the Far East are gathered here... Are you having a banquet or something?  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
...A child?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I'm not a child! I'm Santa! Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily! Aww, how come everyone calls me a child?  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Mostly because you are, I guess?  
Come now, want some candy?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
No. Thank. You.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Besides, everyone knows you're not supposed to take things from strangers.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do you want one?  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Reindeer, where did you get that candy?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
A ramune flavored candy?  
My faaavorite! Its fizziness is so grown-up!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
What do you mean, grown-up...?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Want some candy?  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
What? Really!?  
Thank yo&mdash; N-no, I'm fine.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I don't um... I really don't like mint... It's a little too grown-up for me...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see. Mint flavor is for grown-ups, huh?  
I'll ask the doctor for some next time.  
  
   
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
So, Santa. About my present... (Fidget, fidget)  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Yes, I know. What you truly need is&mdash;  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
This Japanese-English dictionary!  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
...A dictionary...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Yes! Your Noble Phantasm name has, um...  
A lot of grammatical issues and things.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Fix it to proper English for a proper NP name!  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Hmm, even I can tell that this is no fun at all.  
A Japanese-English dictionary for Christmas?  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
That's as disappointing as getting a biography of Schweitzer. No, I mean Schweitzer was a great man, but...  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Anyway, that's a terrible present.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
What? Even Mr. Tawara is complaining!  
This gift is for Mr. Fuuma's own good!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
But I've heard Christmas is a time for celebrations, like New Year's.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Everyone celebrates and everyone is happy. You want a gift like a festival prize, or something cheerful!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Which means it should be something they'll enjoy, not something that makes their life better, right?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...If it's not useful, then it's not a very good present.  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
Hmph.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Otherwise, giving a present is just about making yourself feel good. The giver just wants to take joy in giving something.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
That's no good! It doesn't make the world any better.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
So that means no matter what the person says, the giver has to get them a useful gift to help them improve!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
That's what it means to be Santa.  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
...No, it isn't.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Yes, it is.  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
   
IT IS NOT!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
IS TOO!  
  
   
**Both:**   
   
Grrrr!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Hmph. Nothing for it, then.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
We are Servants. We shall settle this as Servants do, with a Christmas battle!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
By the way, I'm joining Fuuma's side.  
It's childish to give someone a present they don't want.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Fine, then, be that way!  
Santa will kick your butts!  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
I see. ...Then I shall resist with all I've got.  
I am Fuuma Kotarou, fifth leader of the Fuuma Clan.  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
I shall destroy this most pointless of presents!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
My name is Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily! You're gonna take my gift and like it, whether you like it or not!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...Understood. Leave it to me.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
I lost to a kid like her!?  
When did I get so rusty!?  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
I guess I can't be touting “Playing is Justice” anymore... Maybe I should take it easy with the eating, too...  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
I've failed...!  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
But a defeat is a defeat. I suppose I must now accept your Japanese-English dictionary.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Now you can fix your Noble Phantasm's name!  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
Hmm? I've no intention of changing its name.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
What...?  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
...The founders of the Fuuma clan were “ijin.”  
Which is to say, they were not from Japan.  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
I'm told my father was a large, red-haired, blue-eyed Westerner.  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
For the founders, the fading memories of their homeland must have been hard to endure.  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
It is the same with the children born here. We can no longer speak the language of our forefathers.  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
So the least we can do is to use a few (cool-sounding) words of that language to bring them peace...  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
Such sentiment is embedded in my Noble Phantasm...  
So I can't change it.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I-I didn't know that... And to think I tried to give you a dictionary...  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
No, no. I will take it, and thank you for it.  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
In the future, maybe I'll add something to my Noble Phantasm name. So, thank you...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Okay. Let's go, Reindeer.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
It's time to move on.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Huh, she left in the middle of our bit of reflection.  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
That girl&mdash;  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Hmm?  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
That girl doesn't feel any joy in giving presents, does she?  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
No, she doesn't seem to. She's trying to do it right, but...it is sad, too.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
She focuses on usefulness because she doesn't know what kind of gifts bring joy.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
But then... Why did she become Santa in the first place?  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
...Oh?  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
What's wrong?  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
No, I was just wondering...  
  
   
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
Where did Lord Amakusa go?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Reindeer.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is it?  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Umm... Am I doing this all wrong?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You look down.  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Maybe my present for Fuuma Kotarou wasn't so useful after all...  
  
   
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
It's hard being Santa.  
I thought it would be real easy when I started...  
  
   
**???:**  
Oh? Don't tell me you're giving up on being Santa!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Who's there!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? What? I'm detecting a Servant!  
  
   
**???:**  
Heheh. Only a fool would reveal his identity when asked.  
  
   
**???:**  
But I suppose there's no harm in it...  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
I am Santa Island Mask, the mysterious Servant who lives on Santa Island!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Santa Island Mask...!  
He's boarding Llamrei Mark II...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, excuse me.  
But are you Amaku&mdash;  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
   
I am Santa Island Mask!  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
By the way, just because I'm wearing red doesn't mean I am in any way related to any “Emiya” or “Shirou”.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, really?  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Nope. Not at all. I'm just red and tanned.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Of course not. Truly, your identity is shrouded in mystery.  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Yes. Yes, it is.  
  
   
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Okay! Now I know who you are!  
But how come you're bothering me?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Ahem. Jeanne... Oh Jeanne...  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
You mustn't let Fuuma not liking your present get you down.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
It is Santa's job to always get back up and always deliver smiles.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Always... smiles...  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Stand and present. You must stand up... and give presents.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Even Scrooge made it in time.  
There's no way YOU can fail, right?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Whenever you're lost, or in trouble, I shall appear.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Santa Island Mask...!  
Does this make you my mentor?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Um... Sure... I guess...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Okay!  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Heheh. Then I shall guide you on the path to becoming a true Santa.  
  
   
## 4th Night: Merry Christmas in the Labyrinth  
   
**Jack:**   
Here are the plates!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Mister, is there anything else I can help with?  
Oh, noisemakers! Those are important, right?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Mister... Well, I guess that's right. If I tell her not to call me Mister then I'll sound even older.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Oh hey you two, wait.  
Be careful with the noisemakers.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The sound will echo in a labyrinth. You need to be mindful of your neighbors, especially at festival time.  
  
   
**Both:**   
Okay!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Sheesh... I had hoped to avoid a repeat of last year by spending this year alone in a quiet labyrinth.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Um... Sorry.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Don't worry. You got roped into this, too.  
Don't be so timid.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I know this is foreign to you, but it's a celebration, so try to embrace it wholeheartedly.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Master and I are almost from the same era. Our generation has always gotten really excited about holidays and events.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Don't worry about me. Make noise, and have a good time.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Okay. Chriss...mas. Is...name?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Guess what, guess what!  
This year we asked Santa for a doll!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
That's very unlike you... Ahem, erm, sorry, I mean, such innocence is just like you!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
They say the dolls of us are super popular!  
So we want one as a present!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Oh? Wait a minute.  
That's no doll, it's an action figure&mdash;  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Me too! Me too!! I asked for a book!  
But a new tea set would be nice too!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
What did you ask for, Asterios?  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Huh? Nothing...really&mdash;  
  
   
**Both:**   
Huh!? What a waaaaaaste!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Ask for something!  
Or we'll dismember you!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Dismember? Oh, she means this'll be something to remember!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
We'll help you! Asterios, what do you want?  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Hmm... It's...secret...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We hope your wish comes true!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
We'll pray that your wish comes true!  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Thanks. Hope...you...get...wish too...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Okay, food's ready. All that's left is&mdash;  
  
   
**Both:**   
To wait for Santa!  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
...Oh. Someone...is here...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
It must be Santa!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Let's go meet them!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
So much energy.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Asterios, while they're going to see Santa, let's get ready.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Plates on...table... Okay...got it.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Humph. A confidential message from Chaldea...? I didn't know they had my private contact info... Hello?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...We're lost, aren't we?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Absatively.  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Yeaaah... Maybe I was wrong to think I could just figure out the labyrinth...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well, you've been blindly wandering around...  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I-I had a revelation that this was the right way!  
But...maaaybe it was just my imagination!  
  
   
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Hey, someone's here!  
Good, it must be the people who asked Santa for presents!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Hello! I'm Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily!  
Now, your present is&mdash;  
  
   
**Monster:**   
I'MMA GONNA EAT YOU UP!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Gyah&mdash;!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So I'm the present?  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I don't have any er...ro...arrow presents like that! That kind of stuff is, um, will have to wait until you grow up!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're labyrinth lunch.  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Reindeer, i-it's gonna eat us!  
  
   
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**???:**  
Santa! Santa!  
  
   
**???:**  
Wheeere aaare yooou!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Those voices!  
The sweet voices of innocent children calling for Santa!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Come on, let's shout back, Reindeer!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
We're heeere! Where are yooou?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Oh good. We finally found you!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Are you okay? We heard a big scream.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
W-we're fine. Everything's fine. Anyway, were you the one who asked Santa for presents?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Yep! ...Wait. Are you Santa?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Where's last year's Santa?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Oh!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
This year, I am the one true Santa:  
Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Too looong!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
It's a fun name, like spam!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
Spam!?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
But that's too bad!  
I wanted to thank last year's Santa.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Yeah. She gave us lots of presents.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Altria Santa gave you lots of presents?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Yup, it was me and Jack's first Christmas, so she gave us lots of presents!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We got to be friends with Reindeer, too!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
The last Santa did that...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Now, are you ready?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Huh? Ready? Ready for what?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Aww, don't try and fool us! We know!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
You only get presents after you beat Santa in a fight!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
F-fight...?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Well, I guess being Santa this year has been looots of fighting...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Butbutbut! Santa spreads love, not battles!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
It's what the Adult-Me stopped spreading.  
...Stupid Adult-Me!!!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So. Now, this is happening... (sigh)  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I-I'm sorry. When I think about my future, I just can't help it...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Calm down, Little Alter.  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Hey! Don't call me “Little”!  
  
   
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
She's flirting with Master. Bad Santa!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
I am not flirting!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Christmas is a time for children like us!  
I won't let couples steal it!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Let's get lots of presents, Nursery!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Let's do it, Jack!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Now, let's all gather round for story time! If you're naughty on Christmas, Krampus will come for you!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Let's treat our weird Santa Claus guest to our best hospitality!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
We lost...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
   
Waaaahh!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Huh? Wh-what happens if you lose!?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
If you lose, you don't get presents!  
Christmas rules!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
The rules...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
But I do have presents for you...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Huh!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...This is... A rose Black Key!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A rose Black Key!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A what, now?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
When he hears both the sobbing and cheering of little girls, he comes running...  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
I am... Santa Island Mask!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
And then Christmas was saved...  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
I'm here!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
My mentooor...!  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Humph... It would be rude to tell them they're wrong about Christmas.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Don't worry. Here's what you do. (Whisper whisper)  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Um... But isn't lying bad...?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Christmas is a day where lies are okay!  
April Fools? What's that?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I-I understand!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
G-gwah!  
I. Have. Been. Defeated!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Hwah?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Yes, um... It seems like...um...  
You used... Damage over time! Yes...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
I'm so weak... I can't move another step...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I have no choice but to give you these presents, I guess...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You won!  
  
   
**Both:**   
Yaaay!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
We won! We won! I'm so happy!  
I'm so super-duper happy!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Okay! Now it's time to dismember you!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
Please don't.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Oh, you're alive!  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
See? It worked, right?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
R-right!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
But somehow, it just doesn't feel right...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Is that masked person Mommy?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
No, unfortunately, I am not your mother.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
But in a way, Christmas is a day when everyone is your mother. Isn't that wonderful?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Lots of mommies on Christmas? Really?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Santa Mask...what have you done...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No! That will only end badly!  
   
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Hey, don't shout, Reindeer Master!  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Heheh, now that I've ticked Master off, I shall bid you adieu!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
My mentooor...!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Okay, new Santa! It's time...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
...to invite you to our tea party!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Th-thank you very much.  
I'll give you your presents there!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It took you a while. I assume you had to fight some weird Christmas battles.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Oh, Master... And you're the new Santa?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
That's right. This is the new Santa!  
She's going to give us presents!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Her name's um... Um...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Jeanne Spam d'Arc Spam Alter Spam Santa Spam Lily Spam, right?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
What... That's... What?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Take the spam part out, please!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Oh, so it's like a code name.  
But it's still long...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Emiya... You didn't request a Christmas present, did you?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Unfortunately, I'm too old for that.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
And in my homeland, the parents and guardians are the ones to give the presents.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Asterios didn't make any requests, either.  
Don't you have anything you want?  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
I do... But it's...okay...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Hmph. You might think I'm not a really real Santa 'cause I'm young.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I may not look it, but I'm a full-fledged Santa Claus!  
Now tell me what you want!  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
...I want...days like this...to last.  
As long...as...possible...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Huh...?  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Getting...summoned...like this...  
Going...lots of places... Fighting&mdash;  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Someday...will...end...  
Sometimes...hard, but...  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
...It's fun...right now...  
Even...labyrinth...is fun.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Like...a dream...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Um, that wish... I'm sorry... I can't grant it.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Yeah... So, it's okay...  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Want...some food?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...No. I'm Santa. No food for me.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Too bad... It's good...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
How long have you been Santa?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Th-this is my first year.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Hmm. So your Spirit Origin base was Jeanne d'Arc?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
E-enough talking about me.  
Now, let's give these two their presents!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
What kind of present is it?  
I can't wait! I just can't wait!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
A dolly! A dolly!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
...It'll be fine. I'm sure this will be useful...  
For you two...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
That's...  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
...What's this?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
What is it?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
A Hermitage is a quiet place where monks do special spiritual training...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
...It's so you can go someplace quiet... and study instead of just playing all the time...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
I just thought studying...  
Would help Jack and Nursery Rhyme...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
Um... Well...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
It would be good for you... No, it wouldn't.  
I-I'm sorry!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Santa!?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Sh-she ran away...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
What do we do? Santa got sad! On Christmas!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Is it our fault?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
No, it's not your fault.  
Have some food before it gets cold.  
  
   
**Both:**   
Okay...  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
What...do we do...?  
Th-this...is a problem...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Right, then... You, shady-looking guy in the mask who's been creeping in the corner this whole time.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
You got a solution?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Let's see...  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Before we start thinking about a solution, shouldn't we begin by identifying the problem?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
That's fair enough.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Jeanne d'Arc is one thing, but...  
Jeanne Alter... Especially in Lily form...  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
No, I think I know the cause.  
There's something she's missing.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Missing, huh...?  
Hmm. What is it?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...No matter what they say, I just don't have it.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Practicality is all I am.  
Every part of my being is about what's useful...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I have no wish. I could die at any time. I have no hope.  
I could vanish at any moment.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
E-even my existence was impossible from the moment it began...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Something like me...an impossible being, an impossible concept...could have no wish.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...But there was one thing I thought I could do...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I could be someone who grants other people's wishes, instead of my own... I could be Santa Claus.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I thought I could be Santa.  
But...I was wrong.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I borrowed the sack, and got Reindeer Master to come with me...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But I don't know what makes people happy.  
I don't know, so I keep failing and failing&mdash;  
  
   
**Narration:**   
And finally, I just ran away.  
I couldn't do anything right as Santa...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
... (Sigh)  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Saaantaaa!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Who-wha!?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Oh, there you are!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Wow, you're so fast!  
Were you going to leave your Reindeer!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I-I was not!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I-I don't have anything else to say to you once I've given you your present.  
I have to go give the rest out...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
   
We don't need that present!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
Uguh!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Y-you're right... You don't need it, do you?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Yeah. Studying in a quiet place wouldn't be enough for us.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
So we're giving it baaack!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Hic... Ohh...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Instead! Instead, we want you to grant our wish!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
You had a wish...?  
Um, wasn't it a doll, and&mdash;  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Nope! We don't need that!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
We don't need a doll, or a stuffed animal, or cake, or a tree, or a star, or a party, or anything!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Huh? Th-then what do you want!?  
There's nothing else I can give you&mdash;  
  
   
**Jack:**   
There is! There is something, Santa!  
We want&mdash;  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
We want to see the sea!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We wanna go see the beach!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Th-the sea? When you say the sea...  
You mean the ocean?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Um... I've only heard of it... But is it the place where it blows and roars, and is totally different than the land...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We don't know the complicated stuff!  
We don't know, but Asterios brags about it!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
He says it's big! Suuuper-big! Ultra-big!  
He says we're like pebbles next to it!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
If we're pebbles, is Asterios a big rock?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We've never left London, and never seen the sea!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We died before we could.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Me too! I've never seen the sea!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Asterios went with Reindeer, and I hear they all rode on a boat and had a big adventure on the sea a while back!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I'm jealous! I'm so really really jealous!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Sea... Boat... Big adventure... That's...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Wait a minute.  
Are you saying that going to see the sea&mdash;  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Yup! That's our request!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
You took back our present, so Santa will have to grant us our wish!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Of course she will!  
She's Santa!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
B-but&mdash; But that's...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Oh, a rose Black Key.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Santa Island Mask, at your service!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
My mentor! Please, tell me!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
What should I do!?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Well, you should grant their request.  
You've taken back their gift.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Which means you have to grant them another wish.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
But children are selfish.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
So, if you don't grant their request, they'll keep throwing anything you give them right back in your face! They're such returnaholics!  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
...That's how it goes with kids. So, that's why you should at least start by granting their wish.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
I promise you that if you do, you can be a real Santa Claus.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...I-I understand!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Jack, Nursery Rhyme. I'll use the Llamrei Mark II to carry you to the sea!  
  
   
**Both:**   
Yay!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Okay, let's go!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't forget me!  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Reindeer Master!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Uh... It's not like I forgot about you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You know I'm still here, right?  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Oh!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...It's okay. I didn't forget you.  
I would never leave you, Reindeer Master...  
  
   
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I think she totally forgot.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
It completely slipped her mind!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
B-be quiet! Okay everyone, hop on the sleigh!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
The Llamrei Mark II is taking off! Oh, my mentor!  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Yes?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Thank you! I'll do my best!  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Thank you, huh? Oh, I wouldn't thank me... Heh, heh...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Why are you acting like a bad guy? Don't you have to go ahead of them? Let's get a move on.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
...I just wanted to end on a bad guy note, that's all.  
  
   
## 5th Night: When You Wish Upon a Star, Again  
   
**Jack:**   
We're flying!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
It's like the Wizard of Oz!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are there three Ozes?  
   
**Jack:**   
...?  
We're Jack!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I'm Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I don't think that's what we're talking about.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So who's Oz?  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
It's me! Me!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We're Jack!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I'm Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily!  
  
   
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Wah!? Llamrei Mark II, what's wrong!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
S-something's pulling us down!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's a Servant below us!  
Some sort of power is pulling us down!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Um, this is what's called...  
Oh, right! A “crash!”  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Don't look so excited about it, Jack!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Everyone, grab on to something!  
W-we're falling!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Reindeer, are you okay?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think I'm gonna throw up...  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Please don't throw up! Definitely do not throw up!  
I'm right underneath you!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Urmpf...  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Are you throwing up!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
P-please don't throw up!  
  
   
  
   
**Jack:**   
Wow, that was a surprise.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
You don't look surprised, Jack.  
  
   
**???:**  
Fwahahaha! I won't let you take another step!  
You shall not pass!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Wh-who's there?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-it can't be...! Y-you're...!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
   
I am Leonidas! Santa, I cannot let you grant their wish of seeing the ocean!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
H-huh!? Why? Why?  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
That's uhhh... Well... You see...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Some evil mastermind must be commanding him!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's a conspiracy!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Yes, exactly! We have been ordered not to let you show them the sea!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
By a mastermind. Yes, something like that!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
So...yes! You shall not pass!  
Not another step! Definitely not!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
You're so mean! We don't like you, mister!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
That's right! Only meanies, devils, and the Queen of Hearts bully children!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
HEY! I don't like it either!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Why would you be upset about this!?  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Ah...Ahem! Yes, I am the meanest burly muscle-enemy! What of it?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Way too muscly! He's not mommy!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Santa! Should we get him?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...I...guess?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Outta the way, Leonidas!  
This Santa is taking them to see the sea!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Granting wishes is Santa's job.  
I'll beat up anyone who stands in the way!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Very well, Santa! You shall do so over my dead body!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
We've defeated Leonidas...!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Ha! Ha! Ha! It seems I have lost, Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay then, we shall pass after all.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We won, so we'll be stepping over you.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Oh, I almost forgot to tell you.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Santa, there is still a group of Servants waiting ahead called the Fabulous Five, or the Magnificent Seven, or the Dirty Dozen or something like that!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-that many!?  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
What? There's not that many? I must have miscounted then... Pardon me. There may be a little less than that.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
...Anyhow, your journey to the sea will not be an easy one!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Wh-why are you getting in the way of Santa trying to fulfill a wish!?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We just want to see the sea!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Meaniehead!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
You'll have to ask our evil mastermind!  
I don't really, uh...know all the details either...  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
I am a man of logic, so I am not very good in psychology and things like that!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
So please ask the next villainous Servant to come along!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Farewell then, everyone!  
Let us meet again at Chaldea!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Servant has vanished.  
I will go and speak with Leonidas later!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Is everyone all right?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Yep!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Are you all right, Santa?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Yes! That was a cakewalk!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Now what do you want, Santa Island Mask?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
So how about it, Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
It looks like there are a number of enemy Servants awaiting you in your journey to come.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Neither their identities nor goals are known, but they will try and put a stop to your grand Christmas quest.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Granting wishes is a hopelessly difficult journey.  
But even if you do manage that, expect no reward.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Why? Because you are Santa Claus. There is no such thing as a reward for completing your task.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Will you still continue?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I-I...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's something Santa must decide.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I... I want to grant their wish, instead of forcing a present they don't want on them.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I want to give them both exactly what they wished for!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
If the two of you don't mind, I would still like to grant your wish. So let's go see... the ocean!  
  
   
**Both:**   
Okaaay!  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
I see. Then, proceed with caution, Santa.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Fulfilling a wish is intrinsically an unequal thing. Unequal... That is, a problem of desire.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Be it a simple, casual wish or a desperate need with life hanging in the balance, it is Santa Claus who decides whether or not to grant it.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
The one who prays and pleads has their wish granted, while those who don't are not so fulfilled.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
...When you think about it, Santa may not be a saint at all.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Santa may not be a saint at all&mdash;  
That's what Santa Island Mask said.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I wanted to argue and say it wasn't true.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I wanted to say Santa Claus is a noble saint who grants everyone's wishes, and that's why I chose to become Santa.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But I can't shake the feeling that what he said might really be true.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...When I think about what happens after Christmas, I start trembling with fear.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Reindeer Master, Reindeer Master, Reindeer Master.  
Am I okay? Will I be okay?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...Will I still be allowed to exist?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Huh? It's no use.  
The sleigh won't move.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh, even Santa's sleigh can break down.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I see... Well, we'd be in trouble if we got dragged down to the ground anyway!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Let's leave the sleigh here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Don't worry, we'll retrieve the sleigh later.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Luckily, we aren't too far from the ocean.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It may be a little taxing for Master though...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm okay, we can all walk.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I agree. Jack and Nursery Rhyme, are you two okay with that too?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Umm, then we have a favor to ask Reindeer.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Yes, I have something to ask of Reindeer too.  
  
   
**Both:**   
Ready and... Let's all hold hands and walk!!!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Hey, no fair...!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
No, I mean, you're making it difficult for Reindeer Master to walk! Stop it!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't mind.  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Uh, well... P-please mind!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
A Reindeer should not walk hand-in-hand with small children! Santa rules!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wanna join, Santa?  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...!  
W-well, if you insist... Hey, you're out of hands!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
What, your back? Piggyback?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
N-no, that's embarrassing. Please stop!!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Errr... Thank you...  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai! Um, when you return, would you please give me... No, a piggyback ride is too embarrassing!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash? Maaash?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It would be nice for me to get in on an event one of these days... Maaash?  
  
   
## 6th Night: It's a Wonderful Life, Santa!  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
This will be our campsite!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Wow!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Fun, it's fun, so fun!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's a slumber party...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A sleepover on Christmas.  
What a carefree scene we have.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That aside, Fujimaru.  
I transferred the goods you requested.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No problem, it's part of my job.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Spend the night here, and if all goes well, you'll reach the sea tomorrow.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If all goes well, that is!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Oh? This feast...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
It's the feast Mister Emiya made for us!  
We hurried out and forgot all about it!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...I feel a little bad...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Rest assured and eat up. He said the key to party foods is that they taste good even when they get cold.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
D-Don't worry about me. I am not hungry.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
You're not?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I'm sure she is. She's too proud to admit it, I bet.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I-I am not!  
  
   
**Both:**   
You are, you are!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
Am. Not!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jeanne Alter Santa Lily!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Yes?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Mggh!?  
... (munch, munch, munch) ... (gulp)  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
So tasty... I mean! Please don't shove food into my mouth.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Well, it was tasty, though.  
Um...m-more, please?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Piece of cake.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Did I just hear slander and label that I should definitely respond to!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
“Being faithful to one's principles” and “clarity of purpose” are my two mottos. Hmph!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Are those spells or something? I don't get it...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Oh, oh, oh, this roast beef is delicious!  
Delicious, so deliiicious!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You should thank Emiya...  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Of course. When we get back, I'm planning on giving him headpats!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hahaha, I can already see his face, looking like he hates it but fooling no one.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
And I'll scold him too.  
Mister Emiya, quit stealing Noble Phantasms, okay?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Politely thank Mister Emiya.  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Yes. I think I shall write a proper letter.  
Daddy Long... no wait, what should I call him?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Dear Noble-Phantasm-Stealing Mister...  
  
   
  
   
**G：???:**  
Where did you hear that I stole things?  
I'm merely copying for eternity.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
...What are you yelling about?  
  
   
**G：???:**  
I just felt like I had to clear some things up right here, right now.  
  
   
**G：???:**  
...Ahem, anyway, preparations are complete.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
But... This seems kind of ridiculous.  
Why do we need to interfere?  
  
   
**G：???:**  
...Well, simply put, if her heart can't change, there's nothing we can do for her.  
  
   
**G：???:**  
For a wish-granter to try so desperately to avoid admitting her own wish... That's something of a paradox.  
  
   
**G：???:**  
She's deliberately blinding herself to what it really means to grant wishes.  
  
   
**G：???:**  
To even BE Santa Claus is to have the wish granted of being able to grant others' wishes.  
  
   
**G：???:**  
Unless you're pure evil, the feeling of so performing so many good deeds fills the heart.  
  
   
**G：???:**  
In a way, Santa Clause epitomizes that concept.  
  
   
**G：???:**  
A nice child receives a gift.  
A naughty child receives a scolding.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
I see. But Jeanne, she&mdash;  
  
   
**G：???:**  
Right. She lacks that. And that's the problem.  
  
   
**G：???:**  
Left alone, she will lose sight of her reason to live, and maybe even lose her own identity.  
  
   
**G：???:**  
...It would be fine for a Heroic Spirit whose name is engraved in history.  
  
   
**G：???:**  
If someone has faith, and calls your name in awe, it doesn't matter if you have a wish or not.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
However... That's not the case for Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Nobody believes in her. Moreover, the world doesn't know of her at all.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Even if they know of Jeanne d'Arc, nobody thinks someone like her existed behind the scenes.  
  
   
**G：???:**  
After all, she is a Servant born within Orleans.  
A fake given temporary life by the Holy Grail.  
  
   
**G：???:**  
She barely managed to materialize as a Servant after slipping past several trials and causing a nightmarish commotion.  
  
   
**G：???:**  
But even materialization is uncertain in the Lily state.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
I see. That's why Altria Alter passed her the role of Santa.  
  
   
**G：???:**  
But, even given the role of Santa, she still carries a burden within her.  
  
   
**G：???:**  
Hopefully she'll come to understand it in the short journey to the sea&mdash;  
  
   
**F：???:**  
...By the way, what is the meaning of THAT?  
  
   
**G：???:**  
Heh, I have to at least hide my face.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
(So he is a bowman who knows nothing of disguises, I see...)  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Reindeer Master, can't you sleep?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Jack and Nursery Rhymes both crawled into their sleeping bags.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Aren't those two Servants? It shouldn't be necessary to sleep when they're materialized.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
They are wasting needless magical energy.  
Aren't they bothering you, Master Reindeer?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, not at all.  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
They're not...? How come?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I'm going to take my spirit form so I don't cause trouble. I'm a good girl, aren't I? Ahem!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I prefer it this way.  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Y-you prefer it that way?  
But isn't it pointless?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I feel it's more proper for a Servant to stay in spirit form at times like this... So that's what I'll be doing!  
  
   
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...But before that, I have a question.  
Have you ever seen the sea, Reindeer Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I have.  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I see... You have.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Is it really so great for the two of them to get all worked up over it?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Actually, I haven't.  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I see...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Does that mean no one in this party has ever seen the sea?  
  
   
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...To be honest, I have never seen the sea.  
My grown self, I mean the other...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
The original Jeanne d'Arc should have seen the sea in her lifetime...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
But me, I have no memory of the sea.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Besides... If what I know is right, don't people usually go to the sea in summer?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Winter seas are just for looking and not swimming.  
So, um, what's the point in going?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm sure you'll like it.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
You really think so? I can't imagine that.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
After all, unlike those two, I am an adult! Hee hee!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Waaah! Don't pinch my cheeks! Hey, stoppit!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning, Senpai!  
It's snowing again today. Are you all right in the cold?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Physical and mental parameters are all normal, it seems.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
To the seeea!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
We'll reach the sea for sure today! Yaay!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Head straight west from there&mdash;  
Please wait, Master!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Servants detected. There are two!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You do a better job than the Doctor.  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, what, Fujimaru!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, you're good at compliments.  
But I'm glad I can be of help with logistical support!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You've got a cuter voice than Roman.  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hahahahaha, you're dissatisfied with an old man's voice?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Perhaps. Mister Roman's voice sounds somewhat silly.  
It warbles like a dying cat!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
He sounds like a really sad person who gave up on everything, and can't do anything but laugh!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Really, is that what you think?  
I think that might be a bit much.  
  
   
  
   
**???:**  
May I finally make my appearance?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Wh-who's that!?  
  
   
**???:**  
Ahem. Hem-hem!  
  
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Hehehe... I am the cruel contortionist, Hassan of the Cursed Arm. I will not allow you to reach the sea...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Why not!?  
  
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Why, you ask!?  
  
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is there a different Santa!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Could there be other Santas!?  
  
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Ah ha! Yes, that! ...Hehehe, because the real Santa is right here.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Um, that sounded kinda like you just thought of it when Master Reindeer said it.  
  
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Hehehe... twist, twist. (Trying to dodge the accusation with suggestive contortions)  
  
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Time to make your appearance!  
The true Santa... Lord Santam!  
  
   
**???:**  
Heh... I ask of you: What is Santa?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Who's that!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
And Santa is the granter of wishes!  
Someone who brings happiness by bringing gifts!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I...um, well, I may not be the best at that yet, though...  
  
   
**???:**  
Then, I shall answer you.  
  
   
**???:**  
Santas are faceless watchmen who wander from shadow to shadow, hidden from the world!  
  
   
**???:**  
Take a look, this is the proper form of a Santa!  
  
   
**Santam:**   
My name is Santam! I! We! Are Santam!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...Oh?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Emiya... What are you doing there, Emiya?  
  
   
**Santam:**   
   
What!?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
What are you doing? Are you playing dress-up?  
Should we join?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Oh, Mister Emiya. Playing make-believe masked heroes is embarrassing for adults, you know?  
  
   
**Santam:**   
How did they figure it out...!?  
They couldn't figure out Santa Island Mask...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ahem. Anyway, Santam.  
  
   
**Santam:**   
I-I know. Hey, Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily!  
  
   
**Santam:**   
I, Santam, was summoned to correct your mistaken view of Santa.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Mistaken...view of Santa...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Mister has it all wrong too. (whisper)  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I know! (whisper)  
  
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
You over there, shush! Here, have some candy.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
(Nom nom)  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
(Nom nom)  
  
   
**Santam:**   
If you hesitate or run from this, then you are no true Santa!  
  
   
**Santam:**   
Come at me, Santa! But only if you truly believe you are Santa Claus!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I-I am...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's okay. You are Santa.  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Yes! I am, without a doubt, Santa Claus!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
As long as Reindeer Master doesn't abandon me, I'll always be the really real Santa Claus!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're not Santa?  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I don't know.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Perhaps Emi... I mean, Santam may be a better Santa than me...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I mean, he can copy anything and everything.  
  
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
The nerve! First he copies Noble Phantasms, now presents!? He's the Counterfeit King!  
  
   
**Santam:**   
...Forget about that!  
This way I don't need to buy anything, at least.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...But!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
But, since Altria Santa has entrusted me with the bag,  
I am Santa!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Please step aside, Mr. Santam...!  
  
   
  
   
**Santam:**   
All right. Come at me, young lady!  
  
   
**Santam:**   
By the way, I am an Archer, which doesn't really go well against a Lancer, but...never mind that!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Victory!  
  
   
**Santam:**   
Heh... And defeat for me.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...It felt like you were taking it super easy on us...  
But we won! And that's what matters!  
  
   
**Santam:**   
Then move forward.  
Never forget that you are a true Santa.  
  
   
**Santam:**   
And no matter who the enemy is...  
Do not forget your duties as Santa.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Don't worry, Jeanne is a great Santa!  
  
   
**Santam:**   
Then we shall disappear as the defeated should.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong?  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Oh, nothing!  
We've almost reached the sea!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You don't look too well...  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
It's nothing! I'm fine, yes, I'll be fine...  
  
   
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Let us hurry ahead to play the role of the final blockade!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You look like you're enjoying yourself, Ama...  
I mean, Santa Island Mask.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Well, it's been a while since I had a chance to play the villain!  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
And with this impending betrayal, I'm getting all fired up!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hahahahaha. Are you sure you're a Ruler?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Heheheh, whatever do you mean?  
Right now I am just the mysterious Santa Island Mask.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
A masked man can only be a traitor, a villain, or a hero that cannot show his face.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, so you're not a hero?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
I certainly will not call a man who gets in the way of a girl's dream a hero.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
...Now onward!  
Santa Island Mask is coming...  
  
   
## 7th Night: Last Present For You  
   
**Narration:**   
We're getting closer to the sea.  
Our short but difficult journey will end soon.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Will I still be able to be Santa? Will I still get to be the one who delivers gifts and hope?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Or will I disappear, like a dream in morning?  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...That would've been fine.  
At least, that's what I thought to start with.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But why can't I feel that way now?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ruuuun!!!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Dolls are coming after us! It's scaaary!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
You should just let me dismember them!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
I-I-I-I can't stand those creepy inorplantic types!  
If they're living creatures I'm okay, but those, no!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-are you okay, Master!?  
I noticed you're carrying all three of them now!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Wheee!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Master's roaring along!  
Zooooom! Fast like a hippogriff!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They're light!  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I-I bet. I always pay careful attention to my weight!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They're heavy!  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Hey! That's a rude thing to say to a lady!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Grr.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Bring me a scale later.  
I'll show you I'm really light!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Look down!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
It's a pebble!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Eeeeeeep!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai! Senpai! You fell flat on your face!  
Are you all right!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Reindeer Master... You made sure to protect us even when you fell...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
That was such a nice thing to do, Reindeer Master! Awww! You!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
You okay? It hurts? Dismember?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No dismembering Master on Christmas, Jack!  
   
**Jack:**   
Too baaad.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
My nose's bleeding...  
   
**Jack:**   
Looks painful... Want me to lick it?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Liiick...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
EWW! Cut. It. Out!  
  
   
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Look, they've caught up to us while we were messing around!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They're already in battle mode.  
Please ready your weapons!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
O-okay... Err, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, I am not afraaaid! Waaagh!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
It's still coming after us even after it split in two, eww!!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Creaky mannequin dolls chasing us is definitely not a good fairy-tale!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
I'll dismember them all!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Jack's really excited about this...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
A rose Black Key! That means&mdash;  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Yes, I'm sure you're getting tired of my entrance speech.  
I know I am...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, yes. Whatever-Mask.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Thank you. My mentor...!  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
There is no need for you to thank me, Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Why...? Because I've led you into my dastardly, evil, villainous, wicked trap! Mwa ha ha!  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
The hope of every Santa, the sack that contains every gift of the universe, shall be mine!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Get it? I'm your enemy! Mwa ha ha!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, where did that lightning come from?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Try not to think about it too hard.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I-it can't be...  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
The first rule of Santaing is that Santas must be aloof but fair. They grant wishes and give presents fairly, without bias.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Self-interest is unnecessary. All that is required is to embody the ideal that sustains the mechanism that is Santa Claus.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
You are lost, perplexed, and anguished...  
Yet you still continue.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Is it bad to be lost and perplexed?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
It is. If you're Santa, then you must be rational.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Self-interest is unnecessary?  
Even the desire to grant wishes?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
No. It is absolutely not needed for Santa.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Is...that true...?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Um, um, Master?  
What is “self-interest?”  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's the desire to do something for yourself.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Ummm, so we want to go to the sea!  
...Is that self-interest?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
That is correct.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Jeanne... Don't you want to come with us and Nursery to the sea?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We want you to come with us.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I agree, I want to go to the sea with Jack and Jeanne too!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Of course, Master's coming too!  
Doing it together is what makes it fun!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Oh...  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
...I cannot be lending my ears to every bit of nonsense children say.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Now, kindly hand over the sack.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...I will not.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Oh-ho?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I DON'T WANT TO. I'll never give it up!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I cannot give this sack to someone who insults children!  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
So what will you do now?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
I will fight!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Please, Reindeer Master! Lead me to victory!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I want to win against this man!  
No, that's not it.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I cannot lose to this man!  
I just can't lose!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Roger that, Santa Claus!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's grant your wish!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Yes! Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
As the really real Santa Claus, I'm gonna knock Santa Island Mask out!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Hehe... That's how...it should be...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Now, please stand aside!  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Please.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Now that I've seen your resolve as Santa Claus, I have no right to say anything more.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Go ahead.  
Go, and see for yourself...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Jeanne's already gone.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Aww...  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
...Then, Jack. I'll trust you with her.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Yeah, leave it to us!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
...Should we dismember you?  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Thanks, but no thanks♪  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, there isn't any snow around here.  
You're almost to the sea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But if you want to see the sea, please hurry.  
It's almost dusk. It will soon be night.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
So exciting, Jack!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We wonder what it's like.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I wonder if you can swim.  
Maybe not, since it's winter.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Hey, Jeanne.  
...Jeanne?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
S-sorry. What is it?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Ummm, you want to hold hands?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Oh, no. I'm fine...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...You're trembling.  
Then I'll hold your hand, too!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
G-geez. Um, Reindeer Master...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You three go on ahead.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll catch up later.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Understood.  
Then, we're on our way!  
  
   
**???:**  
...Right. That was my dream when I was young.  
  
   
**???:**  
The vast sea spreading across the horizon was a tale I had only heard about.  
  
   
**???:**  
Even if I pretended a wheat field was the sea, I could not hear the sound of the waves.  
  
   
**???:**  
My dream came true after everything was over.  
  
   
**???:**  
Yes, it was the winter of 1430. When I passed through Le Crotoy, I indeed saw the sea.  
  
   
**???:**  
Even if everything was over.  
Even if I understood the destiny that awaited me.  
  
   
**???:**  
That beauty. That sense of awe that made me tremble.  
  
   
**???:**  
It was unforgettable. It was a scene beyond comparison to anything&mdash;  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
(Panting)  
  
   
**Jack:**   
(Panting)  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
This is really hard on a book, sheesh...!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Oh&mdash;  
  
   
**Narration:**   
The waves crashed and roared.  
The violent winds howled.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It may not have been alive, but for all its ferocity, it may as well have been.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Somehow, it was as frightening as the beginning of the world, but as beautiful as the end of all things.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
A gift that, supposedly, was never meant to be, was being opened before my eyes.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...In the end, I was probably a failure as Santa.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Wow, this is the sea?  
Amazing. It's really amazing!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
It's amazing, it's scary, but it's so pretty!  
And the sunset is beautiful!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
The sun is setting!  
It looks like it's melting into the ocean!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Can't we go swimming?  
It should be all right, we're Servants!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Maybe it's disgraceful.  
Oooh, water is bad for paper!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Awww. Then what about you, Jeanne?  
Jeanne, you don't mind, right?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
...Jeanne?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Jeanne?  
  
   
**Both:**   
Eh...!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
Ah, aah... Aaah...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...This. Right, this. I was wrong from the beginning.  
I was wrong.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
This. Is. My. Dream...!!  
I wanted to see the sea...!!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I wanted to see this. I wanted to see this...! For the longest, longest time, I wanted to see the sea...!!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
Waaaaaaaaaaah...!! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Jeanne...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
   
I'm sorry... I'm sorry!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
We didn't come here to grant your wishes.  
This is&mdash;  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...It's fine. It's fine.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Yeah, it's fine. We don't mind.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
You really did your best.  
You did the best any Santa could.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Okay.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Let's listen to the churning waves.  
Let's watch the waves break.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
A primordial display, as fierce as the end of the world. And yet, it's such a beautiful scene&mdash;  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I'm so glad she realized...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Eh? Jeanne!? What in the world is going on here...!?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Wanting to see the sea...was my wish, my desire.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It was a silly dream I had in my childhood. So much so that when I departed at age 17, I had left it behind.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...That girl is not a saint.  
That said, she is not an Avenger, either.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
My young self was simply a child who enjoyed everyday life.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
So, in order to maintain her body as a Servant, there was a need to become something.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...But, she had wished to become Santa.  
Even though no child should become Santa Claus.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Children should not become Santa Claus?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
A proper Santa is what Amakusa&mdash;no, is exactly what Santa Island Mask said.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
The ideal Santa must be impartial in delivering presents.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...? I didn't mind that when I delivered.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Oh, please. But, for children, that is impossible.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Because children should be the ones receiving presents. Not the ones giving them out.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Of course, it's different if they're giving something to someone specific. That's a gift given out of personal desire.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
But Santa Claus isn't like that. Santa's purpose is to deliver love and presents impartially, to all.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
But children desire presents more than anyone else.  
All the more so if they haven't wished for anything yet.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
That's what I hoped her time as Santa Claus would teach her, somehow.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I wanted her, Jeanne, to harbor a desire.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...However, the story went...a little astray.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I never imagined she would be so stubborn.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I thought that after passing out two or three presents, she would realize she harbored her own desires.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Just how selfless are you?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It's just that my everyday life was fulfilling...  
I'm sure I wasn't that charming of a child.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I managed to figure out Jeanne's wish, and asked Jack and Nursery.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I asked them to grant her wish.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Eh? So this journey was...!?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Yes. This journey was never about her becoming Santa Claus&mdash;  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It was a chance for Santa Claus to become Jeanne Alter Santa Lily.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Everyone who appeared along the way...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
If she were to give up after one or two obstacles, we would've been forced to take a different approach.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
But she trudged forward, so it must truly have been her dream to see the sea.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
And, there is one more important thing.  
It wasn't merely going to go see the sea.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Even after all her struggles, she was able to go see the sea with her dear friends.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
As long as she has this memory, she will continue to exist as a Servant.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Oh, so the cat's out of the bag.  
Can I revive myself now?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
If you must.  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
My gosh. Even as a child, she was a formidable opponent! I couldn't afford to go easy on her.  
  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
I actually fought like I meant it, and she took me down.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nope. Stay dead.  
   
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Ehhh? Aren't we done?  
All three of them reached the sea.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wh-whaaaa!? Santa Island Mask came back to life?  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
My gosh. Well, we kind of railroaded the plot, but we managed to finish.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Thank you very much.  
I never imagined you would help me&mdash;  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Hahaha, of course!  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
To have more Jeanne Alters you don't get along with! What could be better?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
So that was your ulterior motive. Geez!  
...But, I am happy with how this worked out.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
She may not be me, but she has untapped potential that even I don't...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Honestly, I'm happy.  
It feels like I gained a little sister.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
You should say that to the original Jeanne Alter.  
That will really upset her.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I know. That's why I won't tell her.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see... So everything was a scheme Amakusa and Jeanne cooked up.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I was completely fooled.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
No, it wasn't me.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Nor was it me. I could have never gotten this far...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Though I was the one who mentioned Jeanne Alter Santa Lily would disappear as she was...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
The plan itself wasn't actually mine.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Eh, then who was it? Santam?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
What? No!  
Heh... Mash, you haven't figured it out?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Eh...?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The one who planned this is the one who understands Servants the most.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The one who understands who is best for which role, and who should guide her along the way.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
And, it must be someone that THE Jeanne Alter trusts from the bottom of her heart, even in her Lily form.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Really, there is only one such mastermind in all the world, isn't there?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
   
Ah... Aah!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...MASTER!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Busted...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
M-Master, you set all of this up!?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Yes, the way you improvised your way through situations, and the way the Servants were appropriately placed was remarkable.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
It was also Fujimaru's plan to make it look like Llamrei Mark II's engine was broken after the crash.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...H-hold on a second!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Why didn't anyone tell me?  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Th-that's because...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Master told us to stay quiet. We were told that Mash could not tell a lie, and telling her would ruin the plan.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
   
SEEEENNPAAAAIIIII!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I-I'm sooorry!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh! So when the Doctor said there was emergency maintenance...!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Of course he was playing along.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm going to the Doctor to protest right this instant!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Try to go easy on him.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, of course. I have to save some energy for you, Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Whew...  
   
**Mash:**   
I hate to burst your bubble, but brace yourself when you return, Master!  
  
   
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Heh. She's pouting.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Girls of that type hold grudges for a long time.  
You should make it up to her soon.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
At a time like this, your best bet is giving her a present.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
(He seems quite used to this...)  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
(Indeed...)  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
(He must have had to do plenty of “making up” during his lifetime...)  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...?  
(Sometimes this place is the worst...)  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Are we done? Did it all work out?  
  
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
It seems everything worked out for the best.  
What a relief!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Thank you all for your hard work.  
I'm sorry for roping you into this too, Asterios.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
No...worries!  
Wish granted...I'm...happy.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
I knew...now is...the most...fun!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The other Servants are gathering in Chaldea.  
This...will be quite the party.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Reindeer Master, Reindeer Master, Reindeer Master!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Quick, everyone, let's hide!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Reindeer Master!  
I figured it out now that I reached the sea!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I'm Santa, but I'm still young.  
I'm immature, selfish, and helpless&mdash;  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
But still, I'm here right now!  
I want to do my best to help you, Reindeer Master!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
So, um, well, even when Christmas is over, even if spring, summer, and autumn come...!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Can I stay by your side?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Thank you sooo much! You are the bestest...  
I love you, Reindeer Master!
