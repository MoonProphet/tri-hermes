# Fate Accel Zero Order  
  
## Prelude  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm sorry to ask you to come this early in the morning,  
Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It hasn't been long since what happened to Da Vinci, but we detected another Singularity.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou, fooou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry for being late, Doctor! I've been having trouble waking up for the past few days&mdash;Oh.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, you're here already, Senpai. As a master of REM sleep, I can see you are ready anytime.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Waking up immediately is a special skill I have.  
   
**Mash:**   
I know. I noticed that when I first met you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I still remember how cheerful you were when you woke up that day. That memory is one of my best to date.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Actually, I pulled an all-nighter...  
   
**Mash:**   
That is not good. Chaldea time is now the benchmark in this world.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, staying past 1 in the morning is bad for your body. Even if you get login bonuses at 4.  
  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash, I'm glad to see that you're doing great, too.  
Well, can I start briefing now?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um...s-sure.  
Sorry, Doctor.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You were talking about a new Singularity, right? But Doctor, aren't those coordinates the same as Singularity F?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It does appear that way on Chaldeas' map, but the temporal axis is different.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This Singularity corresponds to the point 10 years earlier in time than the Singularity F you guys investigated before.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I can't conclude that this is a Holy Grail for certain, but an extremely similar response has been observed.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Earlier, huh? But is it really possible that a Holy Grail would manifest at the same point so frequently?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Actually, even I can't explain that. So, I thought I would bring someone who seemed capable of doing it.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I see. That's why you called me here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Zhuge Liang... No,  
Lord El-Melloi II!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Indeed, I am familiar with Fuyuki City in Japan...  
Or so I'd like to say.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
But unfortunately, my knowledge is estranged from the history recorded by Laplace here in Chaldea.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's expected. Now that human history has been incinerated,  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
many different possibilities got mixed in with Chaldeas' observation results.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Perhaps, Chaldeas didn't exist in the history where Mr. El-Melloi II came from.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Your world and our world... I am not sure which one is the proper history, however...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It is obvious that both worlds are “centered and extremely close to each other.” Otherwise, you wouldn't have been summoned.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You're talking about the cluster of parallel worlds in the Primary Branch... In other words, Phenomena Permissible for Revision that share the same future despite minor differences...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
And Phenomena Designated for Removal: the cluster of parallel worlds that would eventually lead to ruin like fallen leaves.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Unfortunately, that kind of topic is out of my purview.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
It's a part of the World that, unless you're one with a Heroic Spirit like me, is hard to understand.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Besides, it's not something Fujimaru must hear, either.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
So, I'm going to tell you only what I know. This is all just based on the events that occurred in my world, mind you.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
So. Your records indicate that the first Holy Grail War took place in Fuyuki City of 2004. However...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
As far as I know, the Holy Grail War has occured five times in Fuyuki City.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Five times! That many!?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hm, I see. So depending on the situation, the Holy Grail War already happened five times already.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&mdash;Wait, five times already!?  
A ritual of that scale was performed five times!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
How did they hide it from everybody!? Don't tell me the Holy Grail War is a competitive sport in your world,  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
and people treat it like the Olympic Games!?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
A rather amusing idea, but that's not it, Doctor.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
In our case, the Mage's Association and the Holy Church colluded to cover everything up.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
O-Of course they did... Whew, that scared me.  
Please continue, Professor.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The temporal axis observed this time was not the 2004 where Singularity F was located, but 10 years earlier... The Fourth Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
When it comes to my world, it's not a surprise that you could detect a Holy Grail in the past at those coordinates.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The possibility that a Holy Grail could exist at that era in the past... Indeed, that would be able to give birth to a new Singularity.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Could this be a misadjustment on Sheba's part?  
I mean, to observe the light of civilization in the past...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I personally hope that's the case.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Now that human history has been incinerated, it's impossible to observe light on a normal temporal axis.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
If a light is lit on Chaldeas in its current state, that can only be a Singularity that's removed from the temporal axis.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Am I right, Doctor?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
This is probably a stain that has already been disconnected from human history and will eventually contaminate it.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Exactly, Professor. No matter what this Singularity actually is, we must retrieve the Holy Grail that exists there.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I suppose so. Retrieving or destroying it is the mission given to Fujimaru.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...However, there is a problem.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The main reason why the Holy Grail War was repeated five times in Fuyuki was because the Holy Grail never manifested itself, not even once.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Also, due to a certain accident, this ritual has been mutated to a state you can barely call it “ritual” anymore.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
In conclusion, you mustn't retrieve this Holy Grail. It is a Holy Grail that must not manifest... It's just a poison.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
While it tempted the participants as a “wish granting device,” in truth, it was merely a device of mass destruction created for the purpose to eliminating the world.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You are really knowledgeable.  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Of course, I did my research. Besides, it's my responsibility as a participant... No, I just want to reassure myself.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I put in a considerate amount of effort to dismantle Fuyuki's Holy Grail.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
When it comes to the circumstances surrounding this land, I've left no stone unturned.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
How dependable. From the way you sounded, I guess I don't have to ask you to help us, right?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Doctor, you sure are a bad guy. You called me here because you wanted me to help, no?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I will join this investigation. I believe I am the best observer, don't you think so?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You'll be a great help.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes! It'll be very assuring to have all the information about our destination.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You say that, but you really want to go, right?  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I won't deny that. The Fourth Holy Grail War is a fateful event to me in no small way.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
And it's about to begin right now.  
I'd be lying if I said that I had no interest.  
  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Then it's settled. Get ready for Rayshift now.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The target coordinates are Fuyuki City, Japan, 1994.  
Looks like it's gonna be different this time around, too. So watch out!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou!  
  
   
## ACT-1: "The Man Who Knows Fuyuki"  
   
**Mash:**   
So this is...Fuyuki before it was in flames?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Looks peaceful.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. Seeing how vibrant this city is...  
Somehow I feel very relieved.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is it rare for you?  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh no. I've seen the scenery of modern Japan during the incident of Ogawa-heim already. There's not much difference.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
But to think in 10 years, catastrophe would visit a quiet town like this...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You shouldn't be too sentimental. We exist in a world where everything's been incinerated, not just this town.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-You are right... But...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
My apologies, I could've worded it better. Yes, normal life is hard to come by, but don't get obsessed over it.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Fearing the inevitable tragedy like the catastrophe of war would only slow you down.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Because we fight as we are confronted with the destruction of mankind's past and future.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
What I meant was, we should keep that in mind, and prepare ourselves for any situation.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Take this instance for example. You probably think there won't be any threat in a peaceful residential district at a time where everybody is asleep, correct?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right. To be honest, I find it hard to believe this place was the site for a Holy Grail War...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That perception is too naive. In a fight between mages, first you must question everything you see. For example...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Qi Men Dun Jia, Eight Gates Golden Locks Formation!  
  
   
**Assassin:**   
Ugh!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Bfoooou!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Assassin Servant!? Was that Presence Concealment!? But even so that was way too concealed!  
  
   
**Assassin:**   
D-Damn you! How is that possible!?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Are you asking how is it possible for me to see through your Presence Concealment? Well, I couldn't.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
However, I do know from my investigation that the Assassin in the Fourth Holy Grail War could split into multiple entities and monitored the entirety of Fuyuki.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I knew we'd get caught in your surveillance network seeing how flashy Rayshifts can be. Then it's only natural for you to come scouting.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Now that you're in my Stone Sentinel Maze, there's no point in you using Presence Concealment.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Now, Fujimaru, it's time to put up a fight. I'll explain everything later.  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Enemy Servant eliminated. The battle is over.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That was a pretty easy win.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That was pretty weak for a Servant...  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That was just one of the many Assassins. As you've seen, that Assassin has the ability to split and manifest multiple bodies.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That's why the fight is not over yet.  
We must prepare for the next encounter.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Do you mean a single Heroic Spirit has the ability to manifest as a group?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Not only is it a fearsome ability to use in espionage, unless one has an Anti-Army Noble Phantasm, it means that Assassin can overwhelm any opponent with sheer numbers alone.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Humph, but now that I've mastered Qi Men Dun Jia, they'll just end up as my prey.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
They'd have to keep the entire Fuyuki area under surveillance for the time being. That said, they can't exactly ignore us either.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Assassin will most likely keep sending people to attack us.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
As a result, they have broken the golden rule of military strategy by continuously investing their combat personnel without reserve. How very sad, indeed.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We'll have to fight them one after another, but they shouldn't pose too much of a threat.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Just take them out the minute you lay eyes on them. Now then, there's no time to waste. Onward I say! Onward!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? But...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Aren't you going to give us an explanation now?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What the heck is even going on right now?  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Apologies, but it will have to wait. I'm not trying to be pompous, it's just we're in a race against time.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Oh, don't make that face. I'll explain as many things as I can on our way, starting with the most vital matters.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou...  
  
   
## ACT-2: "Military Intervention"  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
To be honest, the Holy Grail War in Fuyuki is basically a scam.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The whole “battle royale for the chance to grant your wish” format is just an outright lie to lure in participants.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A lie? That's terrible... Tricking someone by telling them their wishes will be granted... That's criminal!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
It absolutely is. If these Holy Grail Wars were a widespread thing in a different world, I bet there'd be a lot of lawsuits being filed over them.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That being said, in this world...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That is, in my world, that didn't happen.  
That's because Holy Grail Wars only took place here.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
It was an insidious trap. One that, with the defeat of each participating Servant, means an unprecedented disaster draws closer.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
When the required number of summoned Servant have been sacrificed, “All the Evils of the World” Aŋra Mainiiu will activate.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All the Evils of the World?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's a pretty dangerous-sounding name.  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You don't need to know everything. Just consider it something like a bomb that could destroy the world.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
It has more than enough power to wipe out the entirety of human history up to that point.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Singularity F, the first foundation you all have restored...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I see that as the likely state of Fuyuki after the conclusion of the Fifth Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The first point to fall as the world crumbled. All because a ritual that should have never been carried out was indeed completed.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But why would someone set a trap like that?  
Who would do that?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
This ritual started off with a very different purpose, and became what it is through a ridiculous man-made disaster.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That disaster is a “past event” even in this timeline.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
At any rate, the problem is that the paradox Sheba detected in this era is like a Holy Grail.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see, if the Holy Grail is already here...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Yes. If the Holy Grail has already manifested, this city should be in flames right now. But at a glance, that's not really the case.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
So the Holy Grail detected by Chaldea is likely something different from Fuyuki's Greater Grail, corrupted by Aŋra Mainiiu.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
If I recall, this Fourth Holy Grail War is still in its early stages now. Tonight is when everything moves into motion. We can use that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, I see. So that's why you've been so conscious of the time today.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That's right. Right now, it's critical that we stay ahead of events. This harbor district will be the key.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's going to happen here?  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Hmm, it seems we have to end our chitchat before I get to explain that. The events have caught up to us.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
You there. May I ask who you are?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
It seems you are also participants in the Holy Grail War... Seeing how you have Servants with you.  
  
   
**F：Saber:**   
Irisviel, something is strange. I no longer detect the presence of Lancer, who invited us here.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that... Saber?  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
She appears to be, but that's not her. I mean, she's contracted with another Master already!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is this another Heroine X incident?  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's not go there for now, Senpai.  
This time, we're being serious here...  
  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That is one of the seven Heroic Spirits summoned into the Fourth Holy Grail War. Class Saber, Altria Pendragon.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That being the case, sorry, but we will be your opponent now instead of Lancer.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Irisviel von Einzbern.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What... You! How do you know my True Name!?  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
This is no ordinary opponent.  
Be careful, Saber!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Okay, Fujimaru, time for Round 2. But this opponent is quite powerful. She's on an entirely different level from Assassin.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I realize I'm shoving you into a rather difficult fight, but unfortunately, I need to put one more restriction on you.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...I'm sorry, but don't defeat Saber here.  
Only push far enough to make her retreat.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's a tall order!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And how do you propose we do that?  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I already told you we're pressed for time. I'll explain everything later. Now, go on and do your best!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou!?  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
The enemy Saber has withdrawn from battle!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We don't need to go after her?  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Leave her be.  
The next one is who we should go after.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The next...one?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I've been keeping the Servant who was supposed to fight Saber in my Qi Men Dun Jia formation. But it's about time...  
  
   
**Lancer:**   
Who are you? Was that strange stone maze your doing!? What happened to Saber!?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Something really came out!  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Calm yourself, First Spear of the Knights of Fianna. We're not Archibald's enemies.  
  
   
**Lancer:**   
What!?  
You know my True Name...  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Humph. We seem to be faced with a formidable opponent. How did you know that I was Lancer's Master?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
? Where is that voice coming from?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He's shielding himself with magecraft.  
This Servant's Master is hiding somewhere close by.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Lord Kayneth, we have hastened to join your side and stand in support of you.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
For certain reasons, I cannot divulge my name, so let me give the name of Lady Reines as my guarantor for the time being.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Reines... My niece?  
I demand to know what is going on here!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Though I would not hesitate to provide an explanation at the present time, I would beg your forbearance until tomorrow.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
However, allow me to say just one thing in advance: I can tell you the current location of Caster.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Caster? How do you know that?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Tomorrow at noon, I will prove the truth of my words.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I will show you anew what value lies in listening to our story.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Humph...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Then, we will pay a visit to your penthouse suite in Fuyuki New Tower at 10 p.m. tomorrow night. So for tonight, will you allow us to go?  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Ohh? So you even know my address, do you?  
...Very well. I don't dislike a smart man like yourself.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
All the more if you're a mage with a sense of gratitude. But that faint trace of a working-class accent in your English... What a shame.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
But, very well. I shall accept your proposal.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Having observed how you handled Saber earlier, we will depart here in peace.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
I will neither flee nor hide myself. I look forward to hearing just what it is you're planning.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's... Lancer's Master?  
  
   
**Lancer:**   
Are you certain about this, Master?  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Patience, Lancer. Yes, they are clearly a suspicious bunch. But when you know so little about what you face, it's best to wait and observe.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Best to be cautious when starting a fight, got it?  
  
   
**Lancer:**   
...Understood.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Then we'll be taking our leave.  
Come, let's get going, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Now then, we can finally take a moment to talk properly. How far did I get in my explanation earlier?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You said that once this war ends, the world will be destroyed...  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Ah yes, that's right. Defeated Servants are absorbed into the Greater Grail of Fuyuki as sacrifices to bring it to completion.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
But what happens then is not the granting of a wish, but the release of Aŋra Mainiiu... From the start, this war was never meant to have a winner.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What a cruel tale...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
After investing so much of yourself and even murdering fellow mages, your reward is the opposite of what you would wish... That's truly cruel...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
It certainly is. I imagine if I'd been the winner of the Fifth Holy Grail War, I would have turned evil from despair.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Forgive me. And to think I'm the one who's always saying sentimentality is pointless.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
In my experience, the Greater Grail activates in a limited capacity after the defeat of the fifth Servant.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
However, that also means that if we can convince at least three Servants to withdraw from the battlefield intact...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Then the ritual will end up eternally in limbo, the Holy Grail will remain incomplete, and we can simply secure its vessel. Right?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. So this time, we won't be fighting to defeat the other Servants, but to protect them, in a sense.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Though it'd be best if we could resolve all this amicably.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Right. But we can't assume everyone will agree peacefully.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Since we want the War to end in a stalemate, we need to first seek out and defeat the Servants with whom such an agreement is impossible.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just when I thought you were a gentleman!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Just when I thought reason would triumph!  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I'm aware of my own savagery. Let me say right now that I started off as a cowardly, subservient boy.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
But the war strategist I housed in my body gets so worked up I couldn't help but change.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He is THE Zhuge Liang.  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Truly. Strategists in Ancient China can get even more violent and ruthless than military generals.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sayest thou truly?  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
What kind of foolishness is that?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
It's one thing if theater actors or poets use that language, but why would you talk like that? Are you making fun of them?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Show some respect!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fofofooou...  
  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Now, back to our conversation.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Of the participants in this Holy Grail War, there are two Servants we couldn't even try to spare... Caster and Archer.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Without a shred of doubt, I can say those two would be incapable of reaching an understanding with us.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
So it'd be best to get them out of the way before they start engaging other Servants.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That brings us to Assassin. Their Master is colluding with the one in possession of Archer.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Since we plan to fight Archer, we'll inevitably have to fight Assassin too. Though they've already marked us as opponents anyway.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, the one we fought right after we Rayshifted here...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Next, we have Berserker... Since his madness prevents us from reasoning with him directly, everything depends on his Master.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The key will be whether we can convince the Master while he's still able to keep full control over Berserker without having to use Command Spells.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That said, there's always the possibility Berserker could go on a rampage himself, independent of his Master's will.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
One vital thing I learned after the Fourth War ended is that the one who'd summoned Berserker was in an extremely unstable condition, both physically and mentally.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
But I never did get to meet him myself...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well then, shall we put dealing with Berserker on hold for now?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Though I can't help but feel it is risky, yes.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Therefore, by process of elimination, we can conclude that our best chances for success lie with Saber, Lancer, and Rider.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ahh, so that's why you prevented that clash on the docks between Saber and Lancer.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Then that only leaves Rider's faction.  
Do you think they'd be likely to cooperate?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why are you falling quiet all of a sudden?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is there something worrying you?  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...Yes. It all depends on how well I can get them to accept what I'll say to them.  
  
   
## ACT-3: "Second Owner"  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, Mash? How's the summoning circle coming along?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Not so well...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is it not working?  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Leyline is here, but it's being guarded by another spell so I can't access it.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Hmm, I guess it's difficult to set up on a land controlled by a proper mage...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What do you mean?  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
All the Leylines in this area are under the control of a certain mage clan.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I thought there would be a weakness I could exploit, but I was too naive.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...Her father truly is a skilled mage. With how I am now, I can tell the structure of this spell is very solid.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What should we do? At this rate we won't be able to get supplies from Chaldea.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We've got no choice but to destroy the keystones the mage placed, and take the Leyline for ourselves.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
They should be fairly well-defended,  
but we'll have to break through.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I'd like to avoid unnecessary combat, because we can't fight on an empty stomach. Nothing for it.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You mean destroy the barrier keystones!? If you do that, won't the mage, the Second Owner, get mad?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Of course. But the family that owns this land, the Tohsakas, are also the mages that summoned Archer.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
In other words, they're our enemies to begin with.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I see. But the keystone to the Leylines should be carefully hidden, right?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Don't worry. I know where they are already.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What? How did you find out?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The next heir to the Tohsaka clan is a student of mine. In the end, I dismantle the Greater Grail here with her help.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
When that happens, I learn the structure of the Leylines in this area.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait a second. You're going to wreck your future student's estate?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
This future happens in a different timeline. I have no duty or responsibility to the Tohsakas in this era.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
And the Tohsaka family was one of the clans responsible for the Fuyuki Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
If they lose their Leyline and become impoverished, it's their own fault. I'm sure the future Tohsaka will understand.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's not around to agree, though!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Someday we might end up paying for this big time...  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Let's start with the nearest point.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
After we destroy several of the keystones, we can try setting up the circle again.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Is this okay?  
Stuff like this always comes back to haunt you...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou...  
  
   
## ACT-4: "Those Who Lurk in the Dark"  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait up! I'm picking up traces of magical energy nearby... They're not human, and they're heading straight for you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can see them too. What are those monsters? They look like something, um... that I want nothing to do with.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
They're fragments of the sea monsters summoned by Caster.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The Caster who participated in this Holy Grail War has completely lost his sanity.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
He doesn't have any strategy or plan. He just keeps summoning familiars to devour innocent civilians.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We have to stop them.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's get them!  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
They won't hurt us if we leave them alone, but...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Even in a dark back alley like this, if innocent people come back here there'll be a disaster.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Let's take the time to get rid of them.  
  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
   
## ACT-5: "The Meeting of El-Melloi"  
   
**Mash:**   
That's another Leyline point secured.  
It's going well, isn't it, Master?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Yeah. But it's about time. Let's finish up here, and head to negotiate with Lancer's Master.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is this really going to work?  
He seems like a very cold person...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, he's definitely a cold-blooded mage.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah, well, he's going bald, so...  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Leave it to me. But Fujimaru, I'd like you to let me handle all negotiations with Lord Kayneth.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I'll keep a telepathic channel open so we can communicate in secret, but keep your mouth shut at all times. Got it?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll let you handle it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's see what you can do.  
   
  
   
**Lancer:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(His Servant seems ready to fight at any moment!?)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(The air's heavy... How is El-Melloi going to get through this, I wonder?)  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
I spoke to Archisorte last night. You were lying when you said you were acting on Reines' behalf.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
But you agreed to meet with us anyway.  
Which means...  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
There's something else I want to ask you about.  
Your statements about Caster last night...  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Why were you able to know the Holy Church's actions in advance?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Because for me, it happened long ago in the past.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
What?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The morning after the Servant battle at the wharf, the Overseer speaks to all participants and offers a special reward for the first to kill Caster.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...But that's not all I know.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You originally intended to summon Iskandar for this battle. You even had the catalyst for it.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
However, it was stolen by a student at the Clock Tower, Waver Velvet...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...and you were forced to summon Diarmuid Ua Duibhne instead.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
How did you...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
And it's not you that's providing the magical energy for that Servant, it's your fiancée Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You have her in another room to keep her safe.  
Well, it's good to be careful.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Oh, speaking of Lady Sola-Ui.  
There was a love letter draft left in your study.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I believe it began, “To my beautiful beloved, your eyes glisten like the morning dew...”  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Shut up! Shut up! Enough!  
Who are you!?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I wasn't lying when I said I was acting on behalf of Lady Reines.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
But I will only officially receive that duty four years from now.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
And thus, everything I told you is part of my memories of the past.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
...Humph.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You're taking this seriously. I suppose I should've expected that from the leader of the Archibald family.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
A traveler through time, huh? I've heard that some are working very hard at that research.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
I thought it was stupid nonsense that would never come true... Even so, I need a more believable explanation.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
What you're saying is similar to True Magic.  
Of course, there must be quite the backstory involved.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I'll give you an overview.  
Let me begin.  
  
   
## ACT-6: "United Battlefront"  
   
**Kayneth:**   
I see. Observing the past projected on the Earth Environmental Model, and the Rayshift technology that implemented the Heroic Spirit Summoning System...  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
And all of this is made possible by the use of the Spiritron Calculation Engine.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Spiritron Calculation Engine... I'd heard rumors that the Atlas Institute was working on such a thing, but...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Yes. All of these great achievements in magecraft are accomplished by the Archibald family.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Whaaaaat!?)  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
(You there, don't let it show on your face!)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Remember, poker face, Senpai!)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
(Fou fou fou...)  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
So in the future, the Archibald family achieves all this?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Of course, this is only possible due to your astonishing leadership. Your later exploits at the Clock Tower...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...bring together a number of different academic factions to make this huge project, “Chaldea,” a reality.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(If Director Olga Marie heard this somehow,  
who knows what she'd say...)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Right, I don't even want to imagine it...)  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Humph. I have no connection to the Atlas Institute.  
I dislike that group of eccentrics.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
I would never work with those pessimists...  
Or so I thought, but... Heh. Hehehe.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
I see... Well, it's not impossible, is it!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Whaaaaat!?)  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Whaaaaat!?)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Is the Lord of the Clock Tower an...)  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Well, I was just thinking that the Evocation department and Mineralogy department weren't enough for me to get the upper hand in the academic world.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
I was thinking perhaps it was time to find some new research. Yes. I'm surprised I had such skills in that direction, though.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Hmm. I guess even in my old age I can still pull off some new tricks, huh?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(What&mdash;!? He's not the kind of person I thought he was. He's not, right?)  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Amazing! Yes, I always believed in you.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Right now, you may be struggling, but in the future you'll achieve great things!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Of course, it's not only your technological achievements, but the financial backing provided by the Sophia-Ri clan.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The vast amount of funds required for Chaldea was only available due to the loving relationship you have with your future wife.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Aww, shucks. Hehe. I've dedicated my whole life to magecraft, so I don't know if I could be a family man...  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
At least, I didn't until now!  
I see! Fwahahaha!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Oh, so the reason Lord El-Melloi wanted to get the Lancer faction on his side first was that...)  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(They were the easiest to trick, maybe.)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
(...Fo-u.)  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
And so we've come here to make your future glory all the more certain, Lord Archibald.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
But time travel brings with it certain restrictions on what you can do in the past.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We can't offer you too much aid, but when it comes to information...  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Yes, with your intervention, I'll have the advantage over the enemy at all stages in the process.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The first thing you must do is eliminate Caster.  
The other Masters don't know where he is.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
If you can launch an attack first, the additional Command Spell the Overseer promised will be yours.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Wonderful! So I'll get a fourth Command Spell before I've even used one?  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Hahaha! This battle's as good as won!  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
I joined this battle mostly on a whim, but if my future descendants are intervening...  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Perhaps there's more meaning to this than I thought?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Please just keep in mind that such possibility cannot be ignored.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We can only speak to events that have already been decided when it comes to our intervention.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We must remain silent about anything that has not been observed by anyone in this temporal axis.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Otherwise, the ripples caused by the change of history will grow too great, and may activate the Counter Force.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Hmph...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Our very intervention has caused the future to change and lose its certainty.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
What happens now is unknown to us as well.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
These secret spells enter the realm of True Magic, and so they aren't that easy to use, huh? So I guess it all depends on how you use them.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We're almost at Caster's workshop.  
This is where it gets rough.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
We've already passed the boundary, it seems. Something's coming!  
  
   
**???:**  
HISS!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Caster's pet familiars.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
He has a powerful Noble Phantasm, but is weak as a mage. However, in large numbers these things pose a threat.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Hmph. If it's giving such power to scum who can't even keep their magecraft secret...  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
I guess I'll need to personally secure this Fuyuki Grail.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Go, Lancer!  
Destroy all who would stand in my way!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
As you wish!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, we're being left out of this for some reason,  
but we have to fight, too!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's help them.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Begin the fight!  
   
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou!  
  
   
## ACT-7: "Hunting for Bluebeard"  
   
**Mash:**   
The enemy's weakening! Hurry!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
We'll break through. Is that all right, Master?  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Yes. Punish the owner of these filthy beasts in the name of El-Melloi!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
El-Melloi?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You really are related?  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
(I'll tell you about that some other time...)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-This is...  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
How disgusting...who could do such a thing to a corpse?  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Humph. This explains the Overseer's hurry.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Be careful! I'm detecting a Servant very close to you!  
  
   
**G：Caster:**   
How dare you philistines interfere with our pursuit of beauty? Are you trying to stop the awakening of the Holy Maiden, too?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Marshal Gilles de Rais?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No matter where he's summoned, this guy never listens to what you have to say...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The Master who summoned him this time has only made him worse. Even without the Holy Grail War, he needs to be eliminated.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Nonsense! You will be the ones sacrificed here!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Gilles:**   
Ooh. So this mundane ending is also the will of God?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Servant Caster is defeated.  
We've won.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where's Caster's Master?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're not done here!  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
He's not a mage who poses any threat alone, but...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
He is a murderer who will continue these acts on his own, even without Caster. He must be dealt with.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
But Caster himself has been defeated.  
Haven't we done what the Overseer asked?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Indeed. Go to the Fuyuki Church and request your additional Command Spell. We'll clean things up here.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Humph. That's right. I can't let the Overseer see you, can I? We'll meet again later.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Thank you for your help.  
Hope I see you next time, future heroes.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Now then, I'm not looking forward to it,  
but let's track down this serial killer.  
  
   
## ACT-8: "Irregular"  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master! Down that corridor!  
Someone's lying on the ground!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
He's...dead. From the look of things, this was definitely the Master that summoned Caster.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...No... Did he have a fight with his Servant?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The wound is too clean.  
That's not how Caster would kill.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
But then who? Hmm...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
!?  
Eight Gates Golden Locks Formation!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Lord El-Melloi!?  
What...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Be careful, Mash, Fujimaru!  
A Servant is approaching you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? But there wasn't anything a moment ago...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Presence Concealment. An Assassin? Without the Qi Men Dun Jia, we'd have been in danger too.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
...You use strange techniques.  
I didn't expect to be found.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is this another one of the Assassins from before?  
It feels different.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
This is...different. There was no Servant like this in the Fourth Holy Grail War I knew.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Then this is the “irregularity” that you were searching for?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Perhaps. This may be what has twisted the 1994 Fuyuki into a Singularity.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Even if this isn't the original cause, there must be some connection.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
I've no reason to fight you.  
If you simply let me go, I'll leave.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That's not an option. We need to know who you are, and why you're here.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That's practically why we came here, after all.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
I have no reason to acquiesce to your demands, and if you insist, I'll have to fight you.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You heard them, Fujimaru. Though regrettable, it seems like violence is our only option.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We'll neutralize and capture them, and then get them to cooperate!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Assassin?:**  
Tch, you're strong!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's something strange about this Servant.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He has a different aura than the other Servants in this Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Yes, and he feels familiar.  
He's more similar to us, at Chaldea.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right. He seems similar to Emiya-senpai, the Archer...  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Everyone, be careful! I'm seeing a new Servant.  
They're heading straight for you!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
What? Who could it be now... Oh, no!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh no! Master, get down!  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Are you okay, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, thanks.  
   
**Mash:**   
Good... But we let Assassin get away just now. I'm sorry.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where did Assassin go?  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm sorry. I lost track of his magical energy.  
He's probably already left the battlefield.  
  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That lightning just now destroyed my Golden Locks Formation as well. Curse them...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Oooh! The battle's already begun, it seems.  
Looks like we're a little late, kid.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Huh? That's strange.  
I was sure we'd be the first.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-That's...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I definitely know that face!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This is getting complicated!  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yeah. That Servant is probably Rider, but that Master is...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The first ones here? You idiot!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You know more than anybody how primitive the method you used to find this place was!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You didn't really think you could get a leg up on some of the best mages in the world with that, did you?  
  
   
**Waver:**   
W-Who are you? What are you talking about...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
This time, and every other time, you only make it through your problems thanks to good luck!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
And because things work out in the end, you start to overestimate your own strength!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That's why you never get better!  
You know this, right? RIGHT?  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Wait a second! Why do I have to get a lecture from someone I've never met?  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Who are you, anyway? You're not the Caster who kidnapped the kids, or his Master, are you?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You idiot! You can't even analyze a situation properly!? I'm astonished you thought you could survive a Holy Grail War...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Christ! You're an idiot! An idiot! A huge idiot!  
Go choke on some rice and die!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Something seems to have gotten into Lord El-Melloi...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No one likes confronting their own past.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's funny. Let's watch for a minute.  
   
  
   
**Waver:**   
W-Who do you think you are, anyway?  
Status-wise, you're clearly a Caster!  
  
   
**Waver:**   
The Overseer's figured out that you're ignoring the Holy Grail War to do evil things.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
BULLSHIT! If you can view someone's status, you should be able to figure out that I'm a Pseudo-Servant, you moron!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
God, this is pathetic! The Command Spells on your hand are crying out in shame!  
  
   
**Waver:**   
W-W-Whaaaat? A Pseudo-what?  
  
   
**Waver:**   
It doesn't make sense for there to be extra Casters!  
No one said anything about this!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Hang on, kid. Whether or not that guy's a Caster, he's definitely not the owner of this workshop.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Huh? H-How can you tell?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
By looking at the traces left here. Neither side was using the terrain, or trying to avoid damage to the area when they fought.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
This wasn't a battle between an attacker and defender. Someone tried to run, and someone tried to stop them.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
So neither the one who fled when we arrived, nor these people, are our enemy. They must be someone else.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Yes. The King of Conquerors knows exactly how to read a battlefield.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Anyway, you, with the gloomy face.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
W-What...is it?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
You've been picking on the kid an awful lot.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Does that mean you're prepared to fight the King of Conquerors?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
W-Why would it mean that?  
You know exactly which of us is in the right!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Maybe, but he is my Master.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
If you want to pick a fight with him, as his Servant, that means you'll have to fight me.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Rider, you...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Tch... That's...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, Lord?  
I thought the plan was to not fight Rider?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Let's retreat, Fujimaru.  
There's no sense in fighting here.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Humph. How boring.  
And I thought you had a little more spine.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Hah! So you're gonna say all that, and then turn tail and run? What a wimp!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Hey, don't get cocky.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
GWAH!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He sent that kid flying with the flick of a finger!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What a fickle creature...  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Gaah! This is pissing me off! A Servant shouldn't be getting involved in his Master's fights! Are you a helicopter parent or something?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Calm down, Professor.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No, I think they're supposed to do that...  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But we were lucky enough to run into our third target to protect, the Rider Servant...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Was it okay for things to fall apart like that?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I don't care! They don't plan on seriously fighting anyway.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Ignore them, they'll just sit in their hideout to eat rice crackers and watch videos all day!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I don't know...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like Rider is a touchy subject for Lord El-Melloi, Senpai.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's a problem.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'll have to deal with it ourselves.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
I think so too, yes.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou.  
  
   
## ACT-9: The King of Knights Returns"  
   
**Mash:**   
The summoning circle's complete. Finally...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good work. Now I can finally offer you some real support.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's really a pain, though, meddling with the land another mage controls.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Well, thanks to us, the Leyline the Tohsakas have kept for generations has been ripped into pieces.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
It'll take a lot of talent and technique to rebuild it. Hahahah. It'll be a good practice lesson.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're a tough teacher, huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Isn't that kind of mean?  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Not at all. I'm simply offering my students challenges equal to their abilities and tenacity.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
In other words, I hold the daughter of the Tohsakas in extremely high regard... No point in talking about that now, though.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Um, I'm sorry to interrupt your break, but...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...You have a visitor. One approaching Servant.  
Looks like a Saber.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Saber... Altria Pendragon, the one we saw at the wharf?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Probably.  
Hmm... I guess we exposed ourselves too much.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We made it very obvious that we're an enemy.  
It's inevitable that they'd retaliate.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Servant, Saber-class. Once again, I challenge you.  
Let's have a fair fight.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
A fair fight, huh? Humph.  
I know exactly what you're up to.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
For this Holy Grail War, the Einzberns are using their Servant as a decoy, while a hired assassin strikes from the shadows.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
What? I'll thank you not to make false accusations.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
And what are you planning? I can tell that you weren't an officially summoned Servant.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...What do we do, Lord El-Melloi?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I'd like to avoid unnecessary battles... But it would hurt us to leave this circle we just established.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We have the high ground, Fujimaru.  
We'll draw out the battle until they decide to leave.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Got it!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'll go with that plan.  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
And Mash, in this battle keep an eye out for ambushes on your Master.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I'll use my Qi Men Dun Jia to support you.  
If you sense anything strange, deal with it immediately.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Roger! Mash Kyrielight, commencing combat!  
  
   
## ACT-10: "The Mysterious Assassin"  
   
**Irisviel:**   
This is tough... They have the Leylines on their side.  
As the fight drags on, we'll be at a disadvantage.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Irisviel, I can still fight!  
I have plenty of magical energy stored up!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Hmm, they're hanging in there longer than I thought.  
This is going to be rough...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh!? Watch out!  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
What?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I knew it! An ambush! But that attack...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, it wasn't targeted at Senpai.  
It was for Saber's Master.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
They're not working with the Einzberns?  
So they're someone else entirely?  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
Spells that control the terrain make it so I can't hide, huh? This is tough to work with.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's... the Servant who killed Caster's Master!?  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
It's an Assassin.  
Are they after both of us?  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
No, I'm only interested in one target.  
You, bearer of the Grail.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
...What?  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
It's not that you've done anything wrong. Taking your life is simply the quickest route to dismantling the Grail.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I won't let you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Saber and Assassin have begun combat.  
What should we do?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Regardless of what that Assassin's after,  
we can't lose Saber here.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Fujimaru, move to support Einzbern!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Assassin?:**  
Tch! Stop getting in my way!  
You're not part of the Holy Grail War, are you?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Neither are you, it seems. What are you after?  
Why are you trying to kill the Einzbern Master?  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
...There's no point in explaining it.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
I am commanded from beyond the bounds of human understanding. I cannot coexist with those trapped by ethics.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Assassin has retreated.  
...Shall we follow?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
No. Let's avoid any other battles. Overexerting ourselves just makes us a target for other enemies.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I'd like to suggest to Einzbern that she put away her weapon for the day.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You have more threats to worry about than just us.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
...Very well.  
You did save us.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You may not believe me, but we don't intend to make enemies of the Einzbern clan.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We couldn't help what happened on the wharf.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
In fact, I'd imagine Saber there found it strange that we didn't pursue her.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...That's right, Irisviel. There's something strange about the way they fight.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I don't know why, but there's a meekness, as if they're trying to keep themselves from winning.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
I'll make this simple. Are you our enemies, or our friends?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Our goal does not involve the battle for the Grail, and to achieve that, we need your Saber to be kept safe.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That's all I can say for now while still telling you the truth.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
...Very well. As long as you don't make yourselves obvious enemies of the Einzberns, we'll leave you alone.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
We have lots of other enemies that we need to prioritize first.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Let me ask you something.  
Do you know who that Assassin was?  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Not really. He was saying something strange. That neither of you were participants in the Holy Grail War...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That Assassin's presence is clearly an irregularity.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Not that we're one to talk, in that respect. Our immediate goal is to solve the mystery of his identity.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
The mystery, huh? He did seem strange, yes.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
What do you mean?  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
I've never met him, but for some reason...he seems like someone I'm deeply related to.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Like he was here only to kill me, and I was only here to be killed by him...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
That can't be true!  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
It felt like we existed only to destroy and be destroyed.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The intuition of a homunculus, the crowning achievement of the Einzberns' most secret techniques, cannot be easily dismissed.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...Fated to kill each other... No.  
No, Irisviel. That's not true.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I will protect you with my blade.  
You are here on this battlefield to be victorious.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Yes, you're right. With a Servant like you at my side,  
I have nothing to fear at all.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
One last thing, Heroic Spirit with the shield.  
Your support was wonderful. Thank you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, um...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...(That thing that looks like a shield...  
If that's what I think it is, she's...)  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...(...No, if she doesn't know herself yet,  
it's not right for me to say...)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Something wrong with Mash's shield?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You know it?  
   
  
   
**Altria:**   
...No, not really. But you aren't bad people.  
That I'm sure of.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Y-Yes. It makes me happy to hear that, but...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou.  
  
   
## ACT-11: "Strategist's Trap"  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
All right, now that we've settled things with Saber...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It was a de facto peace treaty, yeah. But what about Lancer... What about Lord Archibald?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He's still enemies with Saber over the Grail, right?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That's the problem. There's a limit to what you can do when you're trying to be friends with both sides.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Hmm... Seems like we'll need to come up with another plan.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Do you have some way to persuade him?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
If you want to convince someone of something, the fastest way is to present them with an illusion they want to hear.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
As Lord Kayneth thinks that the world revolves around him...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...he's likely to believe anything that reinforces that.  
A true strategist can control people's minds with ease.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foufoufou!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Zhuge Liang, that's a con man, not a strategist.  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
But first... We need to deal with this Shadow that refuses to leave us alone.  
  
   
**Assassin:**   
GWACH!  
You found me again&ndash;!?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The Stone Sentinel Maze is perfect for keeping out Assassins. It's like having your own portable workshop.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You fell into my clutches the second you tried to sneak up on me!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Enemy Servant eliminated...  
But is this another fragment?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even if they're not tough individually,  
it's hard to deal with so many of them.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Let's just meet up with Lord Kayneth before anyone else follows us.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Just like you suggested, I sent a familiar to the Matou mansion last night and negotiated with them. Berserker will join our battle,  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
with the condition that we provide for them an opportunity to face the Tohsaka clan's Servant.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Thank you very much. But I'm not certain that it justified the trouble you went through...  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
What? What do you mean?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
There's been a major development on our side.  
A decisive improvement, you could say.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We were able to observe several factors that were still uncertain, allowing us to share much more information with you while still avoiding paradoxes.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
As a result... We can now tell you the entire truth.  
The whole truth about the Fuyuki Grail War.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
(Fo?)  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
W-What do you mean?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Didn't you find it strange to begin with?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Why would a huge ceremony involving a battle for an omnipotent wish granter take place in the middle of nowhere, so far from the Clock Tower?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
And then there's the fact that out of seven participants, only one slot was provided for the Mage's Association.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Yes, well... that's why I participated. Even if it didn't live up to its reputation, it was still a fun game with little risk.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
It's worse than simply not living up to its reputation.  
The whole Fuyuki Grail War is a fake.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Whaaaat?)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Hello!?)  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Senpai, you're letting it show! Keep a poker face!)  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
This is all a conspiracy by an enemy of the Archibald family, the Trambelios.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The plan was to get you away from the Clock Tower for a period of time,  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
and then while you were away, quickly expand their influence in the Mage's Association!  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
W-What!?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We knew that you would fall for this Trambelio trap, and decided to intervene in the past.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
But we couldn't warn you about it in advance.  
In order to share knowledge of the future...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We needed to observe unshakable evidence in the past that a conspiracy existed.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Wow... How does he come up with this stuff...?)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
(...Fou.)  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Last night we found that proof. We have direct testimony from the Tohsakas, one of the three clans behind the Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
H-How did you get it?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We destroyed every Leyline we could find in this city.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Of course, this destruction had nothing to do with the Grail War, but that's why the Tohsakas gave in.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
They didn't want to lose the rights to their land over a fake Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The Tohsakas confessed to colluding with the Trambelios in order to lure you out with a fake fourth Grail War.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(What makes it worse is that he's mixing in truth with the lies...)  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
They knew you wanted glory not as a researcher, but as a warrior, and created the perfect arena to lure you out...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That's the true nature of the Fuyuki ritual.  
The other participants, the Holy Church's Overseer...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
They're all decoys to make the farce more believable.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
How intricate! How wicked!  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
...But those Trambelios, those fools that espouse “democracy” so much, might just do something like that!  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Why... Why have I wasted so much of my valuable time on this!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Welp... He fell for it. Yeah.)  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
But it wasn't a total loss.  
Your defeat of Caster was truly impressive.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I think that display of boldness may have only increased Lady Sola-Ui's love for you.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Y-You think so? Hmm...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I'm sure of it. I am a man who's very sensitive to how women feel in that regard. I believe it was&mdash;  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
“I was never interested in him before, but now that I've seen how brave he is, I've gone from hating him to loving him!”  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
It was a change of that magnitude, I believe.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Oh, my! Wait, what was that one part? Well, whatever. It all worked out in the end!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Oh... I'm starting to kind of feel bad for him...)  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
But still, there is no time to waste. You must hurry to London, and stop the Trambelio plot!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
No matter how secure the Archibald family is, without you they're no match for the wicked plots of the populists.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The aristocracy&mdash;  
The feat of our very clan depends on this!  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Curse those sneaky Trambelios!  
Curse you, Valuayeta!  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
I'll show you a thing or two! Sola-Ui!  
Hurry and get ready!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
(Fooou...)  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Our new battle lies beyond the sea... Master, I, Diarmuid, shall accompany you!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
I never had a wish for the Grail to begin with.  
My spear shall accompany you, no matter the battle!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Oh, excellent. I'm sure that if you have a Servant at your side, Lady Sola-Ui will be very happy.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
...Uh...hmm...  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Lancer, by my Command Spell, I order you.  
Stay here and continue the Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
W-What!?  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Farce or not, now that I've entered the battle,  
I must win it in order to maintain my reputation.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Amazing, Lord El-Melloi! You know exactly how important the Archibald reputation is!  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
I leave you my Servant as a present.  
You may represent the clan in my stead.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Defeat everyone involved in this stupid farce, and show them who is truly strong.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Leave it to me!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
...Very well. If you say so, Master.  
I shall do my best with my new Master.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(This is awful! I've never seen someone get a Servant contract just by making stuff up!)  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
...Oh, one last thing. You said you saw a draft of a love letter in my study, right?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...? Yes. What of it?  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
I would never allow someone to search my room while there was something so foolish still in it.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Am I wrong in thinking that the study you refer to...is one whose master never returned to it?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...Yes. That's right.  
  
   
**Kayneth:**   
Humph. I suppose in that regard, I should thank you.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...Your words honor me, my old Master. You are the Lord I wished to be. You are the great El-Melloi.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Your talents are the greatest treasure the Clock Tower has. Please, take care of yourself.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Lord El-Melloi... I guess here I'll call you Lord El-Melloi II, but...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
What is it?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm likely wasting my time here, but all those lies you told your predecessor...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You're aware of how false they really are, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What do you mean, Doctor?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Chaldea isn't a time machine.  
And you guys aren't there from the future.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This Singularity is just a tiny little area. A bubble appearing on the ashes of human history.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Once the irregularity that created the bubble is gone...it will be like a dream that has nothing to do with real history.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Thus, no matter how hard you work, you can't actually change history.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even if you save someone here, that salvation is only temporary.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In the timeline you're from, the dead will remain dead, and the tragedy will remain a tragedy.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's theoretically impossible to change the past via a Rayshift. Everything you're doing...is meaningless.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
And why does that matter, Doctor?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I just wanted to make sure that you personally knew that nothing would come of this.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It seems to me like you're trying to get through this as peacefully and smoothly as possible.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But you don't need to. There are simpler and easier ways, aren't there?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Nothing will come of it, huh? ...Maybe that's how it looks to you. But to me, this has a lot of meaning.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Even if I can't really save them, I wanted to do the best I could here.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
This isn't atonement for the past.  
My heart refused to let me&mdash;  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
&mdash;be weak enough to make the same mistake twice. That's all.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You're free to laugh at me if you like.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I just don't want to be forced to realize my own powerlessness again.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Of course, the pain of regret is mine alone.  
It means nothing to anyone else.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
In that regard, I do feel bad for wasting Fujimaru and Mash's time, but...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't mind.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's not a waste.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're right. It's wrong to see something bad happening and not try to do anything to stop it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Regardless of the result,  
I agree with Lord El-Melloi's plan.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Thank you. That helps a lot.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I see. That's what it is to be human, huh?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay. I won't bring it up again.  
So do you have a plan for our next move?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Yes. Kayneth prepared an alliance for us with the Berserker group.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We'd be foolish to let that go to waste.  
  
   
## ACT-12: "Discussing the Holy Grail"  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
...You're Lancer's Master?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I've been asked to participate in the Holy Grail War in his stead. You're Matou Kariya, Berserker's Master, right?  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
Yeah. You're going to keep your promise, right?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Of course.  
Archer is a serious threat to us as well.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
But your Servant's Noble Phantasm can defeat him.  
If you want to deal with him, it'll help us a lot.  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
A one-on-one battle with the Tohsaka Servant, someplace where no one else will interfere.  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
You're going to provide us that?  
Here, in this forest?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
More specifically, at the mansion deep in this forest.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Right now, Archer, Saber, and Rider are all there having a standoff.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, Lord El-Melloi, doesn't that mean they're all going to fight each other?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
No, it doesn't.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
All three of them have something they prize more than strategy: their pride as kings.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I see. By the way, what is this forest?  
It's far away from Fuyuki's city limits.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
This is an area the Einzberns set aside for the Holy Grail War. Of course, it has a powerful barrier.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, is it okay for us to just walk straight into a dangerous place like that?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
It's not a problem. Rider destroyed all the alarms and defensive traps. There's no reason to worry.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sounds like things are getting rough.  
What's going on inside there?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Heh. Listen to this.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
They're just having a drinking party.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They're really drinking, Senpai!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What is Rider wearing...  
Also, is that a barrel?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And what's that cup-like thing with the long handle?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
...Fou?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm, I can't see what's going on since it's just audio, but it sounds like something unbelievable.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Oh? That's a strange pairing, I see.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Y-You people are...  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Did you join forces with Berserker? Why?  
  
   
**Waver:**   
A-Are you going to attack us here?  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
That's Tohsaka Tokiomi's Servant... Archer!  
  
   
**Berserker:**   
aaaa...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Who gave you permission to look upon me, mad dog?  
Your insolence warrants death!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
If they're here to ruin our banquet, doesn't that mean that we'd all fight them together?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
No. Those who violate my laws must be judged by my wrath. I am the King of Heroes, and none may stand against me.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
I see. So you're laying down the law as a king, then? Then there's no reason for me to get involved.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Saber and her Master have no problem with that,  
I assume?  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
I'd like to ask them to take it somewhere else... But as long as they aren't attacking us, we've no reason to intervene.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Excellent! Then the terms for the battle are laid down! Berserker's only foe here is Archer.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We will intervene in the fight and take down Archer!  
Fujimaru, your orders!  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
Kill him! Crush him! Berserker!  
  
   
**Berserker:**   
A...uaaa!!  
  
   
## ACT-13: "Battle Royale"  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Damn you! What a farce...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We did it! The King of Heroes, the greatest threat of the Fourth Holy Grail War, is defeated!  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
Hahh... Hahh... Did you see that!  
I showed... Tokiomi...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hm!? Berserker's Master is...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is bad. The vital signs I'm seeing here show he's dying!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Damn it! We made him use too much magical energy!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Hey, if you're going to pass out, at least bind Berserker with a Command Spell!  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He collapsed?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hang in there!  
   
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's okay. He's just unconscious. He's still breathing.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
No! When this Berserker loses control, it'll go after Saber...  
  
   
**Berserker:**   
Aaaaa, uaaaaa!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What? Why is it attacking me!?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We've got no choice.  Fujimaru,  
let's give up on Berserker. We'll take him out here!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Isn't he on our side?  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We can't put Saber in danger here!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
With Archer out of the picture now, we're past the stage where we need Berserker's help anyway.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
This won't be a pleasant fight...  
But I guess I've got no choice against this mad warrior!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Lancer, your Noble Phantasm gives you an advantage against him. Stop whining and help!  
  
   
**Waver:**   
W-What's going on here?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
...  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Pierce him! Gáe Dearg!  
  
   
**Berserker:**   
uaaaaa!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Now, Fujimaru! Finish him...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
HOLD IT!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Rider defended Berserker?  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Hey, what are you doing!?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Yes, I've thought about it, and I've decided.  
I'm joining forces with the mad warrior.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
W-What!?  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Where is this coming from?  
What's the point of siding with him?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Well, there isn't one, probably.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Then why? Just ignore him!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
I'm not choosing who to side with.  
I'm choosing who to fight.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
The King of Heroes was my main target, and he's gone. So I was deciding who to fight next.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Then you want to fight Saber next?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Nope. That gloomy-looking strategist with the furrowed brow. He's my enemy.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...Why fight me?  
You don't stand to gain anything!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
No, not really.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I've done everything I possibly could to avoid a conflict with you! So why!?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
I just don't like you for some reason. That's all.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Wha...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foufou?  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Why!? Why do you always stop making sense whenever something important happens!?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
What doesn't make sense here is that strategist.  
He doesn't make sense at all.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
He's some kind of strange Servant, neither human nor Heroic Spirit. And his predictions are so accurate it's scary...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
He clearly exists outside the rules of this battle.  
And yet he's obviously trying to intervene.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
The one thing I can say for sure...is that he's here to interfere with the Holy Grail War.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
I don't know what he's after, but I'm one of the Servants summoned for the battle.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Someone who's trying to destroy the battle itself is a far greater threat than a mere enemy, right?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Saber, Lancer, if you want to work with him, you're my enemy.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
And thus, I'll side with Berserker. Very simple, right?  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
...What will you do, Master? If you order me to defeat him before Berserker, I'll do it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is it okay to fight?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can we win?  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...No, don't do it. Have you forgotten what we're here for? We're only allowed to defeat four Servants!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We've already defeated Caster and Archer, as well as most of the Assassins.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If we make an enemy out of both of them, then that's more than four...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Well, Berserker's very weak, and his Master is barely alive.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Personally, I'd like to take them and retreat.  
What will you do? Will you follow?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...Leave. There's nothing we can do.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Excellent. Enemies who are smart, but nothing else, are easy to handle.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Once Berserker has revived, we'll settle things then! Farewell!  
  
   
## ACT-14: "The Shadow Chasing Irisviel"  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Things didn't go as planned, did they?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Things just aren't working out, huh?  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That Rider, I knew he had such a crazy attitude, but... who knew it'd be this bad?!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We're enemies just because? What was he on about!? He just pisses me off!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I guess Lord El-Melloi gets emotional when we deal with Rider...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I'm calm! It's just a natural reaction due to the stress!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Lord El-Melloi is chill. Okay?  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm? Hold on a second. I'm getting a magical energy signature approaching you. Its strength indicates it's a Servant.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's different from any remaining Assassin fragments, and also from Rider and Berserker who retreated earlier.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That means...the figures don't add up, right?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Yeah. There are only seven Heroic Spirits that the Fuyuki Holy Grail can call forth. Meaning it's an irregular like us. It's him.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
You mean he's going after Irisviel again?  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
I look away for one second and you've got even more friends, huh? You guys are such a pain.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Now that you've been caught twice by the Eight Gates Golden Locks Formation, you realize it's pointless to hide your presence?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
But how condescending of you to just walk straight up to us.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
Well, I'll never get anywhere just waiting for my chance.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
The Holy Grail War is nearing its end, and before its conclusion, I must have that homunculus destroyed.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
So you're after the vessel of the Holy Grail after all. It seems like our goals are similar, but our methodology is different.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The vessel of the Holy Grail?  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Yes. She's pretending to be Saber's Master, but...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
She is serving a different purpose. She collects the souls of fallen Heroic Spirits... A Lesser Grail, the key that opens the Greater Grail.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Like giving an autonomous personality to ceremonial equipment.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
You're quite knowledgeable. But I don't really like you saying I'm pretending to be a Master. Am I not a proper Master? Is that what you want to say?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
There's no reason to hide anything this late in the game, homunculus.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Irisviel is being used as bait. I know the true Master is hiding in the shadows.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What do you mean? Irisviel is my Master, totally and completely. I am not contracted to anyone else...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
What?  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Will you see this and still doubt?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Command Spells!? Then you really did contract with Saber?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Lord El-Melloi, this is no time to be surprised!  
The enemy Servant is coming at us!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Assassin?:**  
Tch, giving me a hard time...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Hold on. Fighting any more isn't going to get us anywhere. There's nothing for either of us to gain.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
Either of us to gain? It's almost like you completely understand what's going on with me.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You have nothing going on, personally.  
You're a Servant without a Master.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You're not fighting to benefit anyone at all.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
No Master? Then what about the contract?  
How is he getting supplied with magical energy?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Of course, a Servant can only materialize in this world when there's a summoning and a contract.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
However, in his case, the contract wasn't made with a human. ...Isn't that right, envoy of the Counter Force?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Counter Force?! Then this Heroic Spirit has contracted with the World itself!?  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
...How did you come to that conclusion?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We're not part of this temporal axis, and thus have a bird's-eye view of the situation here.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We know that the end of the Holy Grail War here in Fuyuki will lead to the end of the world.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
What was that? What do you mean?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...I wasn't going to say anything until the end, but there's nothing for it. I'm coming clean.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The ritual here at Fuyuki will succeed, unlike in the past and future, and it will lead to the activation of the Greater Grail.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The reason all of this was observed by Sheba&mdash;was that this area had to be the cause of the Singularity.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see! It wasn't just observed as an unstable dimension, but as the origin of the collapse that would become the Singularity!  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
You guys...know not only of the past, but also the future? From a different temporal axis?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That is correct. I witnessed the failure of the fourth war, investigated the fifth war, and prevented the sixth war from happening. That's who I am.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
And I've assumed the role of pinpointing what makes this battle different from the others I've known.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
And the answer to that...is you, Irisviel. You are the vessel of the Holy Grail, and also a Master that controls a Servant.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
It was supposed to take another 10 years to complete. The Einzbern family's ultimate homunculus.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Ten years? That's...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
It's a small difference, but this is a definite advantage.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I mean, for the Einzbern family to find a way to win not via a makeshift guerilla warfare, but actual frontal assault...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Having a Master with the highest specs, commanding the strongest Servant, and access to the Lesser Grail.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Victory is certain for Einzbern. And this victory is plenty reason...for the Counter Force to activate.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
...The Holy Grail War you know of didn't have any interference from the Counter Force?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That's right. It wasn't a factor during the third war. Meanwhile the chance of success was about fifty-fifty during the fourth and fifth war.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
At the very least, from the perspective of the World there was no real emergency to get involved.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
During the fourth war, the Einzberns' research results were behind by one whole generation. When they finally completed their research during the fifth war, they made a mistake in their strategy.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
To be honest, I'm surprised to see that this time the Einzberns managed to call checkmate on everyone.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So to sum things up, this Singularity is basically...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...the embodiment of the “if” situation where the Einzberns are the superior contestant in this war.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Yes, and the Holy Grail reading that Chaldea picked up was most likely Irisviel's magical circuits themselves...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Seeing how perfect the results of the Einzberns' research are this time, you can probably even call her a pseudo Holy Grail.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
I'm not sure whether or not you're praising me or insulting me, but I'm going to need you to explain more.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
What do you mean the world will end if the Fuyuki Holy Grail is completed?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Yes, allow me to tell you everything. Agent of the Counter Force, you should follow along, as well.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I'll show you an even better way to accomplish the task you have been given.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
A simpler and even more certain way than destroying this homunculus here?  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Well, I can't say that it's entirely simpler, but let me ask you something instead, Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Would you do anything because it's the simpler way?  
Do you wish to kill Irisviel here, no matter what happens?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
...Fou?  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
...I do not know. I have not thought of that. I had resigned myself to thinking there was no other choice. I did not have the luxury of options.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
And now that you're telling me to choose... I am faced with a conflict within myself that is rather difficult to explain.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
If you're telling me there is a different choice with this homunculus...then I think I would like to explore that as well.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
I wonder why? I've never experienced this feeling before.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That's because you still have a human heart left in you.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
A foolish but noble soul, from before you became part of the machine known as the Counter Force.  
  
   
## ACT-15: "To the Greater Grail"  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
...And so, that's how I became Berserker's Master.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Hmm. I see... Hey, kid. Does everyone in this Holy Grail War have a tragic story like that?  
  
   
**Waver:**   
So has that clueless optimism of yours finally gotten embarrassing?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Huh? Why?  
  
   
**Waver:**   
...I was stupid for asking.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
So... Matou was it? Now that you've taken out Archer. What do you plan on doing next?  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
Finishing off Tohsaka Tokiomi, of course.  
He's powerless without a Servant. So, this time...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Right.  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
Bleh!  
  
   
**Waver:**   
You punched him? Punched him?!  
Isn't that going to kill him?!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Hey, Matou Kariya. Who did you want to protect?  
Who should you save first?  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
That... would be Sakura...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
So if you killed that Tokiomi guy, would the situation change for her right away?  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
But...without the Grail, Zouken is going to...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
So would finishing off Tokiomi be the fastest way to get the Grail?  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Geez... So your need, priority, and capability aren't lining up in the least, you fool.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
You're not worthy of sharing my path of conquest yet! Time to go, kid.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Huh? Where?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
To conquer and pillage, of course!  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
...Huh? Hmm... What?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Unfortunately, it seems the mastermind is out.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Well, I burned all the bugs in that basement to a crisp, so let's call it a day for now. By the way, I brought this girl here with me.  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
S-Sakura?!  
You...saved her?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Don't be stupid. I'm not a savior. I'm a conqueror.  
That makes this girl part of my plunder. She's my slave.  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
What!?  
  
   
**Waver:**   
H-Hey. What are you saying!?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
But now that she's my slave, I'm willing to trade her on my own terms.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Do you want to pay her way out of bondage?  
Matou Kariya, I'll do that for the appropriate price.  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
Y-You want to solve this with money?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Not at all. That right hand of yours will do.  
Give it to me, along with your Command Spells.  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
!?  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Huh? But wouldn't that...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Well with your current state, it's possible you'd die.  
It's your one life, you decide what to do with it.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Do you take the chance to save this girl and possibly live your days, or fight to the end with Berserker? You decide.  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
Sakura...  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
...Okay. Take my right hand.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Got it. Then clench your teeth hard and endure it.  
  
   
**Matou Kariya:**   
Gah...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Good. It seems the crest worms came along with the hand. I'm sure they'd pick the Command Spells over their host.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
W-Will...he be okay?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
The rest is up to fate, though his chances are low.  
Kid, take care of him as much as you can.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
I-I am not that good with healing spells!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Hey, Mithrenes!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
This girl and half-dead boy here. Take them out of Fuyuki, find a building with a red cross on it, carry them there, and return.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
...Is that the kind of job you would ask a Heroic Spirit to do?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
You're the one who had me get water from a river, and you want to say that?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Well, there is no other course.  
We must hurry and head to the next battle.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
The next? You're going to fight them all?  
Without Berserker?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
You worried, kid?  
  
   
**Waver:**   
What are you saying?  
You're stronger than everyone.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
I don't think we'd lose, even if all the Servants came at us at once!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Hahahaha! Well said!  
Now, let us hurry to the decisive battle!  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
M-My manor is burning! My cute bugs are dead?  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
That Kariya! What did you do!? And where's Sakura!? They ran out on me!  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
Gah!! Those damn brats!  
  
   
**Berserker:**   
uaaaaa...  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
...Huh? Berserker? His magical energy has been used up and he's about to disappear...  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
...These are... Kariya's Command Spells?  
He turned his back on the Holy Grail War and ran!  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
But for him to cut off his hand and dump it here...  
That's not something a coward like him would do...  
  
   
**Berserker:**   
uaaaaa...  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
Aww, there, there. You're upset you've been betrayed too, huh? You're just like me. I just can't let this go.  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
Guess we'll just have to show them...what happens to savages who oppose the Matou family.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
I can't believe it... The Greater Grail is tainted by an Anti-Hero!?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Seeing is believing. It's faster to just have you see the real thing.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
The dismantling of the Greater Grail... If you knew a way to solve the problem at its root, why didn't you do it?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Well... This is kind of like taking out nitroglycerin from a huge vat.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
If you're not careful, the container will break and it could spell disaster. In order to do it safely, you need preparations.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
It couldn't just happen over a night or two.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And yet now, you're just riding in here without any preparations...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I reconsidered my methodology.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
If we have enough firepower to blow away our vat along with its explosive contents, it's possible things would go our way.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Based on a quick estimate, in addition to us from Chaldea, if we can get at least three more Servants...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
We could do what we needed to.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, but if we could unify the three factions...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Yes, only four Servants would end up defeated, achieving our goal and resolving the issue at hand in a peaceful way.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Had we won over Rider's faction, we wouldn't have needed to deal with the Greater Grail.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
So we've excluded the possibility of dismantling the Greater Grail this time, but...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I didn't think the Counter Force would become involved. There couldn't be a better ally if we had him on our side.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
No matter when or where we're called for battle, we will always shed blood for purposes beyond human intellect.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
It is not unusual for us to find ourselves against everyone, without being understood by a single person.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
...So this is a strange feeling. It's been a long time since I've worked with someone...Huh?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Yes, they were caught in my Bounded Field as well. As I thought. I guess Presence Concealment doesn't work against a better Assassin.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
I'm also good at lurking in the shadows. Both of us are aware of what the other is capable of.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...An Assassin Servant!? You two are amazing.  
I couldn't tell at all!  
  
   
**Assassin:**   
How dare you... Don't think you're going to win just because you prevented my first strike! I'm going to get you all this time!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Watch out. They're different than the fragments we've dealt with up until now. They're going to mobilize everyone else left.  
  
   
## ACT-16: "The King's Pride"  
   
**Assassin:**   
Why would you...try so hard to destroy our wish...  
Oh, a bell... I can hear the bell toll...  
  
   
**Assassin:**   
O great founder&mdash;the first and the last “Old Man”...  
  
   
**Assassin:**   
Please, please forgive me...  
I have...blundered...yet again...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Servant Assassin completely eliminated.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
That's what happens to assassins that miss their chance and aren't able to pick the best occasion.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
It seems the Master who gave Assassin their orders didn't know how to handle them in the right manner.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Aha. The Master must've been replaced.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Perhaps Tohsaka, having lost Archer, was plotting a comeback by switching to Assassin.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Tohsaka family is a hot mess.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That elegant man's luck is the worst.  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Humph. It's only fair for a talented&ndash;no,  
privileged&ndash;family to meet adversity!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Normally he's a fair person, but sometimes I feel like he's fighting with something we can't see...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is...the place where our final battle took place in Singularity F.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
...Fooou.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
What do you think, Einzbern? Now that we are here, it's obvious that the magical energy radiating from the  Greater Grail has been altered.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
...Yes. Unfortunately. This is not even close to the Holy Grail that we sought after.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
How ironic. By the time victory was finally within our reach, what we'd desperately desired to win had already been destroyed...  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Even before checking its contents, I can strongly feel the evil presence hiding within.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Is it okay to just break this carelessly?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Only three Servants have been defeated.  
That's not enough to awaken Aŋra Mainiiu.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Even if it overflows, it'll be just a mass of ambiguous curses with no purpose at this point. We can handle it with the force that we have now.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Wait. I'm picking up magical energy!  
A Servant is approaching at incredible speed!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That speed is not normal. It must be a type of Noble Phantasm that can increase mobility!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Increase mobility? That means...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Yes, it must be Rider.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Rider!? Why now!?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Oh, good, good. Looks like it's still not too late.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Do you still intend to continue the Holy Grail War? Don't you sense the cursed magical energy that's coming from the Greater Grail?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That is not the wish granter you were looking for!  
Wake up already to the fact that you've been tricked!  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Huh? Well, I don't give a damn.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
You don't!?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
No. I just came to stop you guys from running away with the winnings.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
You, the strategist with a wry face. This is the perfect battlefield for us, I must say.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...I don't get it. What is it that makes you oppose us so much?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
It seems you somehow can see what lies beyond our fate, but isn't that boring?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
If that's really the case, I must at least play the role of someone who ruins your plan.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
What?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
I can tell, you're also chasing a shadow on the path of conquest. Which means you share the same joy as me, the King of Conquerors.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
I must entertain a fellow like you.  
For that's my duty as a king.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Entertain... You stand as our enemy only to make him laugh?  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
That's crazy...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Yes, he's most certainly crazy. However, it's a motivation befitting of this Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
While there is no limit to this king's selfish arrogance, his actions are based on his interest in others. In fact&mdash;  
  
   
**Altria:**   
He might look like a goril&ndash; Excuse me, a brute, but the truth is, he's notorious for meddling in others' business!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
B-But you should also excel at assessing the situation!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
It's obvious the kind of catastrophe this curse-filled Greater Grail is capable of causing! The world is facing a crisis!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Despite the situation, you still want to fight me for such a selfish motive!? What are you thinking!?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Sure, you grumble, but you do like them, don't you? Games.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...What...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Your burden and resolve do not matter. Unless you enjoy the challenge that's in front of you, life has no meaning.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Get more fired up, strategist. I will even stake my own path of conquest. Come, time to finish this.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
For you to go that far... Are you saying...  
I am worthy as your opponent?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Of course. Though I have no knowledge of where you came from and how you are connected with me.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
But what stands in front of me is indeed a warrior.  
I won't be satisfied unless I defeat this man.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...Haha, ahahaha, hah hah hah hah hah!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wh-What's going on...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Sorry, Fujimaru, my Master.  
This will be my one selfish request.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Let me fight him. My mission, the fate of the world...  
I'll put it all aside.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I'll focus solely on him. I don't even know if I can win or not... Just let me at him!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It can't be helped.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sounds exciting.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai!?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I appreciate your approval. Heh, if it were one of my students, I'd give the fool a good dressing-down...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I won't mind even if I end up being defeated. If it's for someone as foolish as him or myself... Then there's meaning in serving him!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Foufou, fo&mdash;u!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou, even you give such a war cry... What's going on here doesn't make sense to me...  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Do not be sad, girl. This is called a man's dream. If you are also a Heroic Spirit, join them even if you don't understand.  
  
   
## ACT-17: "Wish of the Three Founding Families"  
   
**Waver:**   
Rider!?  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Ugh... Well done! Hehehe, Stone Sentinel Maze, huh? You got me there.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
This is not a skill I mastered myself.  
I gained it by accident.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
After all, with my own ability, I'm no match for you...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Haha, moron.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did Rider just...flick his forehead?  
   
  
   
**Waver:**   
Why would you do that to him...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
It doesn't matter whose power you wield on the path of conquest. How you wield it, lead it... That's what makes the difference.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
If you saw my Ionioi Hetairoi with your own eyes, I'd expect you to understand that, at least. Idiot.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Rider...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Huh? Did it hurt? Sorry. I don't know how to control my strength. I've lost the feeling in my fingertips lately, so...  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Well, since you've already gotten such deep lines in your forehead, I assume a small attack won't leave a scar. Right?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...Nonsense. Some scars affect the heart more than the body.  
  
   
**Iskandar:**   
Haha, give me a break. Anyway, it was a good fight.  
I'm sorry, kid, but it's time for me to go...  
  
   
**Waver:**   
...Why? I am the one who's supposed to cry now.  
Why are you crying instead?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...You're right. I'm embarrassed to be seen this way.  
I never thought I would have such a meeting in this lifetime...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Ugh! ...What!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Lord El-Melloi!?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foooh!?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What was that attack!? From where!?  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
Bahaha, you dropped your guard, strategist. I guess even the magecraft you're so proud of is useless if you're distracted by something so pathetic.  
  
   
**Berserker:**   
aaa...Aaaaa...  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Berserker!?  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
Damn! I didn't expect to be ambushed at this stage!  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
You must be... Zolgen, Makiri's mage!  
What on earth are you doing!?  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
That's my line, Einzbern!  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
Helping to dismantle the Greater Grail... Have you fallen so far that you've even forgotten the wish of the Founding Three?  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
It's so obvious! This ritual failed a long time ago! Heaven's Feel will never be achieved with the Grail in a state like this!  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
So what? What's wrong with it? What we become... What we achieve... That no longer has any meaning.  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
We've devoted everything to the past 500 years...  
I don't care as long as I can witness the fruit of our labor.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Zolgen, are you out of your mind!?  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
Who knows? How do you separate sanity from insanity? Now that my soul has withered away, I can no longer tell.  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
Still, I will not let you lay one finger on this Greater Grail. This is the realization of our old dream. I will never hand it over!  
  
   
**Berserker:**   
Aaaaaa!  
  
   
## ACT-18: "The Fallen Grail"  
   
**Mash:**   
We have defeated Berserker!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How's Lord El-Melloi?  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
He is unconscious and in critical condition. He needs help right away. But the fact that we defeated Berserker means...  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
Bahaha, ahahahaha! Fools. To think you unwittingly helped to bring this ceremony to its completion.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see, that was the fifth Servant defeated...  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
At this stage, I no longer need the Lesser Grail to extract the sacrifices' magical energy. With my life's final ritual, I'll fuel them directly into the Greater Grail!  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Huh!? I am losing the magical energy I was conserving... Zolgen, is this your doing!?  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
No... I only hastened its awakening... Not in an imitation like yourself, but in a true vessel...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master! Someone...is coming out of the Greater Grail!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Dark Irisviel:**   
Well done, Makiri Zolgen. You're more shriveled up than the last time I saw you.  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
Oh. Oh... Justeaze, the Chalice of Heaven...  
Your beauty is exquisite...  
  
   
**Zouken:**   
I see... So that's it... My role was no more than to recall your visage...  
  
   
**Dark Irisviel:**   
My senile old foe. Enough. Your part is over. Now, go dream of the ideals that'll never be fulfilled... Then die.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Zolgen!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Berserker's Master...was devoured?  
  
   
**Dark Irisviel:**   
It's still...not enough. As if my vessel could be filled with five measly Heroic Spirits.  
  
   
**Dark Irisviel:**   
You awaken me after preparing such a pitiful offering? The preparations for the feast are far from complete!  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Justeaze Lizrich... No, it's a ruined Holy Grail, polluted by All the Evils of the World.  
  
   
**Dark Irisviel:**   
Humph. What a foolish remark from my descendant. I am the Chalice of Heaven. The incarnation of the Third Magic who shall reach the Root and annihilate all evil.  
  
   
**Dark Irisviel:**   
It's time. Pledge me your lives and souls! I will draw upon your blood to fulfill the cherished wish of 1,000 years!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Saber, she is...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Yes, this magical energy's density...  
At this rate we have no chance of victory!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see... Since we lost Zhuge Liang&ndash;I mean, Lord El-Melloi II&ndash;we can no longer fight...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Were he safe, we may have stood a chance.  
But the absence of one Servant is critical!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Especially against an enemy of this stature, his loss is devastating. We must retreat!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
The two of us will hold her off while we evacuate the Masters and the others. Lancer, you with me!?  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Yes!  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
But Saber!  
What will become of you?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
As long as the Master flees to safety, we can immediately withdraw from the front lines via Command Spells.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
But, since you hold the Command Spells, everything hinges on your safety! Now, go!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Heroic Spirit of the Shield! Assassin of the Counter Force! Please protect the Master!  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
Yes, leave it to me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes, I will!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...Ah!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm so glad you regained consciousness!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Ugh... My Spirit Core is undamaged, but I can't move my body... I guess a Pseudo-Servant has its limits...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...What about Saber and Lancer?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They're fighting the Greater Grail.  
   
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Ugh! In order to let us retreat?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. They said we had no chance of winning at the time...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
No! Even if we run, we don't have any reserve forces! We must stand our ground and fight!  
  
   
**Waver:**   
So what do we do!? You yourself have no strength left to stand with us!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Waver Velvet, you're the key here.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
I know who you are, you brat.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
You find your powerlessness repugnant. You despise your incompetency and mediocrity. You are mired in an inferiority complex, with nothing to boast of to the world.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
W-What's up with you? Don't tell me...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The immature dream of a brat who always laments his own weakness... Are you prepared to finally wake up?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The terror of wielding overwhelming power. The terror that heavy responsibility imposes. Will you taste these sensations while you are still just a brat?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Lord El-Melloi, what are you doing!?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Waver:**   
...  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Fine. I'm ready. We have no other choice, right?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Hah, you truly are a fool. A fool who doesn't know his place. You truly understand nothing at all.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
But, that's exactly why...he once took a particular interest in you...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Glory lies beyond the horizon... Huh?  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Tell me! What am I supposed to do?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Take my hand and pray. “The art of certain victory, the mode of harmonizing with charges, is a matter of opportunity.”  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Umm... The art of certain victory...the mode of harmonizing with charges...is a matter of opportunity.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Ah! Whoa!  
  
   
**Waver:**   
What's this? What's happening to me...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Yes, it seems you've gained the strategist's favor.  
He permits you to be his temporary avatar.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Instead of my broken body, he can boss you around as much as he wants.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou!  
  
   
**Waver:**   
I can tell...there's something inside of me... Zhuge Liang... Whaaaaat!?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Rejoice, young man. You are the hero you always dreamed of being. Now, can you do your new form justice?  
  
   
**Waver:**   
...Yeah, I can! I can do this!  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Fujimaru, sorry, but I'm entrusting you with this immature Pseudo-Servant.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
He's a little unreliable, but he'll be of use.  
Go back and aid Saber and Lancer!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Leave it to me!  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
We need to hurry, Senpai, while Saber and Lancer are still alive!  
  
   
**Dark Irisviel:**   
Hah hah, is this the best you can do? Pathetic Heroic Spirits. It's like you remained solely to nourish me.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Ugh...this isn't good. I'm nearing my limit...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
She's stronger than I imagined!  
At this rate...  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Hold on a bit longer and push through!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
What!? Why did you return!?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
No, Lancer, the boy is different from before...  
This magical energy... He is clearly a Servant!  
  
   
**Waver:**   
We've returned to our former strength. We have Saber, Lancer, and the Counter Force Assassin...  
  
   
**Waver:**   
The lineup he envisioned is assembled!  
All we need now is orders, Fujimaru!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This will be the final battle!  
   
  
   
**Dark Irisviel:**   
Foolishness... I'll devour every one of you.  
Return to your origins within my chalice!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Dark Irisviel:**   
Why... This hand...was meant to reach the ends of the stars...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Did we...win?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The enemy's magical energy has disappeared...  
Victory is ours!  
  
   
**Waver:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good job!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you okay?  
   
  
   
**Waver:**   
I...I had no idea!  
  
   
**Waver:**   
I never knew that fighting for one's life...was this terrifying...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
You did well. Very well for one's first battle.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
You deserve praise for not freezing in terror.  
Be proud and bask in the glory of your victory.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
Everyone...  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
They're all Heroic Spirits summoned to Fuyuki by the Greater Grail. Now that it's gone, they can't retain their form...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
It is time to part ways. It was a taxing battle, but I am glad it ended well.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
May we meet on another battlefield. I am sure it will happen when the fate of the world is at stake.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The Holy Grail that we detected from Chaldea has disappeared without a trace.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Also, Irisviel. You no longer have the ability to transform into the Holy Grail. What do you intend to do now?  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Yes. Now that the Holy Grail War has been rendered meaningless, my existence is of no value.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
I helped to destroy the Greater Grail with my own hands. There's no way that I can return to Einzbern now...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Umm, our original goal included recovering the Holy Grail that appeared in this Singularity.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If you like, why not return with us to Chaldea?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. If we abandon her, someone else might try to use her later for more sinister purposes.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's probably best for us to take her under our wing.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
...For someone with no one left to turn to, it's a generous offer.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Yes, I accept. I entrust myself to you all. Master from another world, let's work for a better future.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, thank you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We welcome you!  
   
  
   
**Waver:**   
Are you guys...returning, too?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Yes. Zhuge Liang as well. Relax.  
You'll soon return to your ordinary, mediocre self.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
...  
  
   
**Waver:**   
You were right. This power is still a bit too much for me.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Now that you know that, it is time to continue your studies.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Someday, you will be forced to bear this power.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Be consoled by the fact that you still have time.  
Become strong while you still can.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
You sound just like Rider.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
Humph, don't embarrass me. I am still no match for the King of Conquerors.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
“Still,” you say? Does that mean you're also training?  
To eventually be his equal?  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
...  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
The route to the surface is a labyrinth of caves, so I'll take you there. Then we part ways.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
I guess I should say goodbye as well.  
  
   
**Waver:**   
You're not returning to the surface?  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
I don't originally belong to this world, so it's a waste of time. If I wait, I'll soon be summoned back to the Throne.  
  
   
**El-Melloi:**   
That's right, I forgot what type of being you were.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
...  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
...It's strange. After we met, I had the feeling that only death would separate us.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Yes, it's weird, but I don't know why.  
Yet...this strange feeling is not unpleasant.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
Yeah. Same here...  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
...I thought I was cursed to fulfill my mission only through sacrifice or death.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
Now, for the first time, I feel like I was able to fight to protect something.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
Thank you. ...Although I don't know whether it's my place to say such words.  
  
   
**Irisviel:**   
Yes. Goodbye. I'm glad I could meet you, nameless Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good work! You went through a lot this time.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou, foou.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Da Vinci is now giving Miss Irisviel a thorough checkup.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm surprised. I never thought a Holy Grail could exist in such a form.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What about Lord El-Melloi?  
How are his injuries?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Compared to a genuine Servant, Servants like us who possess the flesh of human beings   
   
**Mash:**   
will die if they suffer too much damage...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes. He'll be in the ICU for a while.  
He needs complete rest.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
How reckless to have someone else form a contract with a Heroic Spirit while seriously injured.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He was nonchalant so you wouldn't be alarmed, but he was actually in really bad shape.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But, thanks to him, we somehow pulled through... Also, the Heroic Spirit who was an agent of the Counter Force...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Right. What a strange encounter. To think that even after humanity's history has been incinerated, the Counter Force would still function.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is this “Counter Force”?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What was he, exactly?  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Counter Force...in theory, it's a force that acts to preserve the human race.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's said that people who accomplished rare feats of valor in life are summoned by this Counter Force.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If a crisis threatens the human race, they are summoned through time and space to eliminate the source of the calamity.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So they are Servants who have no Masters, summoned solely to fight?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes. Even in death, their souls are tasked with a mission to fight for all eternity.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I cannot possibly understand their feelings...  
They must endure unspeakable anguish.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Although I'm a mere Demi-Servant and not a Heroic Spirit,  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I cannot imagine being summoned to battle without a Master.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Really?  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. What supports me in battle is you, Senpai, the one I sealed a contract with.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That bond gives me the strength and courage to overcome fear. To fight without such support would be too cruel.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou...  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
...  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
Will you come out already? You're the star performer.  
No one will interfere now.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Humph! So you knew.  
I don't want to! What a pain.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Isn't conserving energy popular in this age?  
I wanted to catch you off your guard.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Well, good job picking up on me instead.  
I appreciate the welcome. Less lonely.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
But why didn't you warn your friends of the danger?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
They only destroyed a contaminated Holy Grail.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
I, Aŋra Mainiiu, its contents, remain separate.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
I didn't want to rely on the help of others intervening from another world.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
Your curse belongs solely to this world. It does not extend to theirs. It's logical for me to deal with you alone.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Oh, how nice. It's a fine thing to take pride in one's work.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
I guess it would be painful for us to be pitied when we fight. No one would gain anything.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Happiness is everything, right?  
Well, anyway&mdash;  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
...In that sense, you're just as much on the losing side as I am.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
I know you're a mass murderer by your scent.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
I bet you'll come “here” in the end.  
After you're worn out by an eternity of abuse.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
I don't think so. This is the fate I have chosen.  
I was never compelled to, nor did I ever give in.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
That's precisely why. You should have broken down somewhere along the line. That way you would have had a chance at peace, even salvation.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
But because you couldn't stop being a “Hero of Justice” until the very end, even after death, you became a cogwheel in a mechanism like the Counter Force.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Surely that's proof you're on the losing side.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
My life led me to this point. I have no regrets.  
I do admit that we're fundamentally similar.  
  
   
**Assassin?:**  
You'll curse the world, and I'll save it.  
We are both devices with assigned roles. That's all.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
&mdash;  
(Grin)  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
Okay. If you're so sure, I guess I have to show you my respect.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
If curses and salvation face each other, there is no choice. We must both seek love and recognition in the way we know best.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
For such an occasion, why don't you name yourself? Unlike me, you remember your own name, yeah?  
  
   
**G：Emiya Kiritsugu:**   
Emiya... Kiritsugu. Or so I was called when I lived as a human being.  
  
   
**G：Emiya Kiritsugu:**   
I will save the world. I did so until now, and I will forever.  
  
   
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**   
There ain't a world that can be saved by humans.  
How long will you try to disprove that conclusion!  
  
   
## ACT-EX: "Retrieving the Holy Grail"  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai? Do we still need something here?  
I believe the case is closed...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't think that's the last Holy Grail...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Uh, you know. Standard procedure.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see... Senpai's sixth sense... I understand.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I, Mash Kyrielight, shall search the premises as Senpai's Servant!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ahhh&mdash;!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That was fast!?  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, this is bad! Look what I found sprawled out in the shade, near the cliff!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Ouch, that hurts, that hurts! Don't pull so hard!  
I'm weak, so if you pull too hard something'll snap off!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There is a suspicious-looking figure lying on the ground!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's the shadow itself&mdash;!?  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. I cannot grasp its identity even in light.  
But it is not quite a Shadow Servant...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What should we do, Master?  
He does not seem particularly evil...  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Oh, so supple. Hmm, fine curves too...  
(Rub rub)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hyahhh!?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Heh heh. Perks of being injured. Time to recover! Even on the verge of death, a beast's instincts are uncontrollable!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
You have quite a fine Servant with you!  
She would give my former Master a run for her money!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
I'm just talking about looks, of course.  
It's sad, but both are still mentally children.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This...is a Perverted Servant!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash, give him a good beating.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes! I, Mash Kyrielight, shall mercilessly exterminate him with my new moves!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**C：???:**  
Ahh&mdash;!?  
You wretches seriously beat on an injured person!?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
This is a scene where a virtuous person would ask,  
“Why were you lying on the ground?”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I beg your pardon. I'll try it again.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Why aren't you still on the ground?  
It looks like you're still breathing, but...  
  
   
**C：???:**  
That can happen. Dead, but not really dead.  
You see, resurrection is my special ability.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Ah, never mind. This isn't the time to bring that up.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
I know about you people. You're the ones who destroyed the Greater Grail along with that Counter Force fellow.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes. Do you know about Senpai?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
I do. I observed your Master fighting for a bit from the best seat in the house. So, anyway, what?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
It's your fault that I was lying collapsed on the ground... Would you believe me if I said that?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Our fault?  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
I'll explain the rest, Avenger.  
At ease.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Iri!? But that form...  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
Hello, Mash and Fujimaru.  
Good work.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
I'm the Dress of Heaven. I'm a different entity than Irisviel, with whom you were working until just a while ago&mdash;  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
Simply put, I'm like the spirit of the Greater Grail.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
That's right. You people destroyed a woman in black, didn't you? Think of her as a good version of that.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
That's a crude explanation, Avenger.  
Why can't you be more classy...  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Forgive me. At any rate, you were beating me viciously until just a moment ago. Of course I'm going to harbor a deep grudge.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Iri is the one who beat that man in black to within an inch of his life?  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
...Well, I hate to say it, but yes and no.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
Fujimaru. Listen closely, for this is your group's problem as well.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
You destroyed the black Holy Grail. That's fine.  
I don't mind. Even though it was painful.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
But to be honest, that was a mistake.  
You shouldn't have done it.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
The reason is&mdash;  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
The reason is, the way you destroyed it was too lenient!  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
You should've done it more thoroughly! For example, you could've blown it up together with one floor of a luxury hotel!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Spoken like a rock star!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...All right, this is starting to sound familiar.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um... Iri?  
What do you mean by that?  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
I'm saying you were too naive. You didn't completely destroy the black Holy Grail.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
You broke the vessel in a clumsy manner.  
As a result, the Lesser Grail...  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
Irisviel was broken into shards and scattered. Each of those shards has begun working independently.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
They are&mdash;  
Fire Iri, Water Iri, Earth Iri, and Wind Iri!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The four elements of Irisviel!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's too many.  
   
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Exactly. Four of them are too much to handle.  
I tried to get them to calm down...  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
...But I was just wasting my breath, as they attacked me.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
Yes. Like the original Irisviel, the four split-up elements would be kind under normal circumstances.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
But Fire Iri, who is particularly extreme, rose up in revolt.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fire Iri?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Revolt?  
   
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
Yes. And like leaping flames, the other Iris were awakened to their violent side.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
Sad to say... but even after gaining their freedom and individual personalities, their grudge against you didn't disappear.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
Do you understand, Fujimaru?  
Your war isn't over yet.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
Four types of Irisviel, let loose in Fuyuki.  
You have a responsibility and a duty to defeat them.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
They're, how can I put it... Anyway, persistent, immune to discouragement, and obstinate.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
I'm sure they'll come back after you beat them.  
But please stick with them until the job is done.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
Besides, it looks like that gloomy, yet shy, sensitive, and handsome man... Ahem. I mean, the hooded assassin has gone back.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
In the first place, that man isn't suited for this kind of job, right?  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
I'm asking you as a favor, on behalf of Avenger.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
Assassin... Save the city of Fuyuki instead of him.  
Only you people can do this job.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sure. Leave it to us.  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
Thank you. I was hoping for that answer, cute Master♡  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Are we done talking? Then I'm counting on you folks to take care of the rest.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
I'm not suited for fighting and I hear that woman in white doesn't want to see me, undisciplined as I am.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
From here on out, this is your domain. Teach those fragments of the Holy Grail a lesson to the very end.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That dress is lovely.  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
(Blush) Th-This is Einzbern's formal wear. I mean...  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
It's a dress for magical rituals! Now don't pay me any more embarrassing compliments!  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Are we done talking? Then I'm counting on you folks to take care of the rest.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
I'm not suited for fighting and I hear that woman in white doesn't want to see me, undisciplined as I am.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
From here on out, this is your domain. Teach those fragments of the Holy Grail a lesson to the very end.  
  
   
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
Yes. The rest is up to you, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**The Dress of Heaven:**   
Also, I'd like a word with you, Avenger, so please come here. When you get right down to it, this is your fault, isn't it?  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
But I'm a victim in all of this.  
Corporal punishment is barbarous.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I feel like I'm out of the loop, but we've got a new mission, Master!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's make a fresh start and search Fuyuki again from scratch!
