# Chaldea Summer Memory -The White Beach of Relaxation-  
  
## Prelude  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&mdash;So, I'm counting on you again,  
Fujimaru, Mash.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I will prepare the Rayshift, so wait one moment.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
[♂ Hey /♀ Oh], what's wrong, Mash?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you feeling sick?  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, no, Senpai.  
It's nothing. Nothing, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
How to put it... I'm feeling uneasy in a way I have not experienced before.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Now that I think about it, we've really had a lot of unexpected Rayshifts so far.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But what is about to happen is incomparable.  
It looks like a wonderous, amazing experience...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Perhaps not so much a shift as it will be a drift?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Ah, I'm sorry.  
That doesn't make any sense.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please don't worry about it, Senpai.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash, are you sick? Let me feel your forehead.  
   
**Mash:**   
...O-Oh! S-Senpai! What are you...!?  
I'm, I'm fine. My temperature is normal!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm the same as usual...  
No, I'm better than usual!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
When you say that, all I can do is worry...  
   
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
&mdash;A bad premonition, huh?  
No need for concern, Master.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
This time, I will be accompanying you, too. We should assume one or two unexpected events will occur.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Meat tastes better when there's some tendon in it. Challenges are more fun when they're difficult.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Hmm. I don't think we should expect bad things to happen. However...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I agree with her. There's no need for concern.  
No matter what happens, we will be by your side.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, Altria... Yes, I suppose you're right.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And we'll be backing you up as much as possible from the Command Room. Small miscalculations will be instantly fixed.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes... That's right.  
Chaldea's staff are all intelligent people.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry, everyone, for saying something strange.  
Let's do our best as always, Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
YEAH!  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Good answer! Fujimaru is getting used to the Celtic style!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sir, yes sir!  
   
**Altria:**   
Yes, what is it?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Ah... You were just responding to Scáthach, were you?  
Sorry. I thought you said “sire.”  
  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay, preparation complete.  
Systems are good to go!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So, let's go! I'm counting on you as usual!  
Rayshift&mdash;start!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Huh!? What the hell is this!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Monitor malfunction here... too...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ugh, more trouble as usual!  
This is bad! What on earth's going on&mdash;  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...and hurry up, to&mdash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm trying, I'm trying! But... this isn't a simple value fluctuation, it's a trap!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There's a big hole in front of our usual Rayshift point! We can't fix it with simple trajectory correction!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Really? Then jump!  
Jump, Romani!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Like this?! Hmph, hah!  
...Owwww!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The doctor goofed around at the wrong time, so I sent him away! Operator, send the anchor, hurry!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
We have to at least pinpoint our destination!  
...What, you already did? Nice!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Ah, but it's no use!  
We're... We're drifting!  
  
   
## Section 1: "Castaways"  
   
**Mash:**   
...pai...  
Senpai...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, Senpai, you're awake!  
Thank goodness!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where are we?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I don't know.  
Looks like the Rayshift didn't execute correctly.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At the very least, I don't think this is our intended destination.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No one seems to be injured&ndash;including Fou, who has tagged along once again...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor... Doctor?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...As you can see, we've lost all communications with Chaldea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's why... we don't even know where we are...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...Well, it's not Britain.  
Just look at these tropical-looking plants.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm. Right now, our problem is... not where this is, but what lives here.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Master, behind you.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...What?  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, watch out!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oh no... I left myself wide open!  
   
**Mash:**   
Now is not the time for sarcasm!  
Watch out!  
  
   
  
   
**???:**  
...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh... This is an unknown enemy type!  
It's quite violent, but we have to fight back, Master!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Heh heh. Unknown enemies on an unknown land...  
Now this is getting very convenient for me!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Phew. It seems we're safe for now.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's get back to assessing our situation.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, let's. Does anyone know anything about this place?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who here knows where we are?  
   
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Hmm. Unfortunately, I have no recollection of this place.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Same here. To tell you the truth, I have no idea where this is. At the very least we are not in Japan.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I'm not sure either, but I don't think it's France.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I've seen many places... but this doesn't seem to be one of them. It's a nice beach, though...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I agree. Definitely relaxing.  
...I just can't pinpoint the location.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Don't ask me, the hell would I know?  
But anyway, more importantly... (Sideways glance)  
  
   
**Altria:**   
As I said earlier, this does not appear to be Britain.  
Apologies for not being able to help more.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
This should be where we pirates demonstrate our worth... But it's rather difficult since there's no identifying trait anywhere that I can see.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
What do you make of it, Mary?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Hmm, can't really say.  
I've seen countless beaches like this.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
...But those crabs we just fought?  
They were a first for me.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So many Servants!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's so lively...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master. I do feel a little uneasy because we can't get in touch with the doctor and Chaldea, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
With this many Servants around,  
I am sure nothing can stop&mdash;  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Hey! Hey, hey, heeeeey!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I've been standing here forever, and you didn't even notice me!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
You went and broke-oro my fragile kokoro!  
Imma need someone to give me a hug!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Sheesh, even my tamed self is gonna go Caribbean Smash on you! A whole hour of waiting and all you're doing is staring at the girls...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Ah, wait. Actually, I guess anyone'd do the same...and thus so would I.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...But still, don't ignore me!  
Notice me!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Hahaha, aren't you being a little hasty, Mr. Beard?  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
In situations like this, we must not outshine others; we may glow, but only discreetly.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
After all, yes, there are too many attractive ladies gathered here!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
If we sparkle too much, all kinds of slightly troublesome incidents might occur!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Polygamy, swinging, and orgies, to name a few!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
...Don't you think so, Diarmuid?  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Yes. As expected from my liege... You really understand your...self well. Really keen observation.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
(Sigh) Does your Cycle always have to start with a skit?  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
...I apologize. Despite his behavior, he is rather excited about all of this.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Yeah, I understand how he feels. To be taken adrift and arrive at an unknown island is nothing short of dangerous.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
No, what my lord is happy about is not the adventure that awaits us, but being able to develop a deeper bond with all the heroes here...  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Hahaha. Well, when the time comes, things will happen. We should just enjoy the view, don't you think?  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
The beautiful sea, the gentle breeze, crabs you can't help but run your sword through... It's a curious little beach, isn't it?  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...Crabs have it rough, don't you think? I mean, only being able to walk sideways all the time and all that?  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Still, the way they always look their opponent dead in the eye, that strong spirit... It's something all martial artists should learn from.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
And what about those hermit crabs, eh? Carrying your house on your back, like a mobile shut-in... Jinako should learn from them.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hmm. It seems the men are all gathered over there.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There were more people when we departed, but looks like we got separated. I hope they're safe.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
I'll ask because we're both pirates.  
Blackbeard, do you know where we are?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Oi, I'm talking to you!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Oh, please excuse me! It's just... it's been so long since I last spoke with you, Missy Mary! It's like we're... touching each other with our words... It just makes me so excited!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Your voice is so irresistible! How do I put it... I like the way it passes through my ears, all slippery yet sticky!  
  
   
**Mary:**   
That does it, I'm going to murder him.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Yes, let's. We'll cut him into pieces.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Wait, wait, wait! You want to know about where we are, right!? To tell you the truth, I can't tell just by our current situation.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
I knew it, he's useless.  
Now I won't feel bad when I slit his throat.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Don't jump to conclusions!  
You really can't judge porn by its thumbnail you know!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I was going to say we might get a better idea if we take a look from the sea!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Yes... You're right. We pirates remember continents and their shapes by how they look when viewed from a ship at sea.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then... could you go and check?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're counting on you, Blackbeard.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, that is probably the best option we have.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Whaaat? No way?  
You really going to tell me that, Master?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I can't believe you're telling the super kawaii Blackbeard to go into the unknown sea alone...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I don't even have a ship...  
I don't want to use my Noble Phantasm for this...  
  
   
**Mary:**   
What are you talking about?  
You do have a ship, see?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Isn't that just a plain ol' log that drifted to the beach!?  
A lonely log!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Here you go. Now you have an oar, too. It's perfect!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...That's just a plank! A plain ol' piece o' wood!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
If I go out to sea with this... I'll die!  
Me, a Servant! I'll definitely die!  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Ugh, shut up already.  
Why do you have to make such a big deal out of this?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
...Fine. If you go, I'll give you a reward.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Say what!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He just did a complete 180!  
Look at that twinkle in his eye!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Hah... Hah... Hah... (Gulp)  
“Reward,” Missy Mary? What kind of reward?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Let's see... I'll let you touch my body one time.  
How about that?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Anywhere!?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Anywhere you want.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
YAS! It's finally my time to shine!  
Back in a jiffy, dohoho, hahahahaha!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, there he goes... Just straddled the log, grabbed the plank, and rowed right out.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All it took is eight small words...  
I don't really know what to say. Is this really okay?  
  
   
**Anne:**   
I'll ask the same thing, but for slightly different reasons: is this really okay, Mary? For you?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Of course not, but I don't mind. It's just a hunch, but I can feel something abnormal about this sea.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
I doubt he'll come back in one piece.  
  
   
**???:**  
...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...! More enemies!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Hmph.  
Attacking us while we're busy looking at the sea, huh?  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Looks like the island's inhabitants understand battle.  
Not by knowledge, but by instinct.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Master Fujimaru, what shall we do?  
We could always just abandon Mr. Beard and flee...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We have to annihilate them!  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes.  
Mash Kyrielight, going in!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's believe in Blacky and run!  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, it's wonderful you have faith in Blackbeard's fighting spirit, but that won't do!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We have to take them out!  
Just in case Blackbeard comes back!  
  
   
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...It's really quiet here, Senpai.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Feels like it's just the two of us here...  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Ah, and what a nice sky.  
All those stars, shining so bright...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It really is beautiful.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's perfect, a sky full of stars.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. I looked up at the sky in other Rayshift destinations, too, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I think this is the first time seeing so many stars without other light sources getting in the way.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I feel a little strange.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Since I met you, Senpai, I've experienced many things I never thought I would experience...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...and seen many things I never thought I would see.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
After all, until we met, Chaldea was all I ever knew.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Now, everything is new and colorful...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry, Senpai.  
I... I don't know what I'm saying.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The stars are so beautiful, and silent, and I guess I spoke without thinking.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm glad I get to spend time like this with you, Mash.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai. I'm really glad, too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It was an unexpected accident which brought us here. Honestly, there's no telling how things will pan out.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At this very moment, however, I feel very lucky to have seen this starry sky with you, Senpai.  
  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Mary:**   
Hmm... I kind of expected Blackbeard to be back by now, too...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
My blood's pumping and I'm ready for some action, but there's nothing to do. What to do, what to do...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Oh? Aching for some action, hmm?  
I'll go a round or two with you, if you want.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Look, if I try to kill time with you, the only thing getting killed... will be me!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I don't want to badmouth you, my mentor.  
But try to read the room a little, would ya?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
This ain't the Land of Shadows where violence rules, so try and adapt just a bit, kay?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Urk! Why you...! What a flippant disciple...  
Still, you have a point... Rrrrr...!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Good. Now that I shut her up, maybe I'll go fishing.  
It's been a while, but I'm sure it will come back to me.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Heh... Martha. You don't need to hold back.  
You can't hide the truth from these eyes.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Huh!? Wh-What are you talking about!?  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
We're by the sea, and it's summer. In a place where everyone lets themselves go, I can tell... You're getting really worked up, aren't you?  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Hahaha, no need to keep it all inside. What do you say? Shall we go at it right now?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Worked up? Go at it!? Why you...! That's enough sexual harassment, thank you very much!  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Alas, that's not what I was getting at. What I desire is the combination technique from you and Tarasque.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
There are no other saints around.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
I thought you would be able to show me your forbidden technique if there's no one around to mock you. Was I mistaken?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh, there you go again, techniques and battle once more...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Still... It's pretty boring just waiting for the return of our one-man scout party.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I need something to keep myself preoccupied, too...  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...Wait. All of your desires are about to come true.  
Look over there at that shore.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Mikon! Really!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, Tamamo. Something is definitely coming.  
I can see it, too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...It's a large group of giant crabs!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...Umm, that's not what I desired...  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...It is impressive how fast they scuttle along with their multiple legs. As a time-killer, they're really more than we deserve.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh, the gods! That's so typical of you, Karna, but still... Still...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The crabs aren't changing course!  
It seems we'll just have to fight them!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Sweet, merciful heaven, it's too hot for this business!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Agreed. But never mind the enemy and their numbers...  
I mean, look at me!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Tch. This ain't beach armor, that's for sure.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh well. Crustaceous monsters from the sea have appeared... Heh heh heh, this kind of feels like old times!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Ah. Is this what that hack samurai was referring to?  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Fionn:**   
What's that? Over there on the shore?  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
As always, my liege has good eyes.  
It appears some seaweed washed ashore... or not.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
It's a dead body! The man must have drowned and quietly drifted ashore during that frenetic battle.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
I suppose we should give him proper rites and bury him.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
YES to beautiful girls, HELL NO to burial.  
I'm...still...alive... (twitch twitch)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's Blackbeard! He came back while we were fighting!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's ask him what he found out.  
While we still can...  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Blackbeard, tell us what you know.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Ah, a girl's voice penetrates my dizzy head... Aye, that reminds me. The reward... Where's my reward?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
After we hear your report. Now spill!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Hahehue, you'll be squirming after that, Missy Mary.  
I bet your heart's already poundin' with anxiety an' anticipation!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I can hardly wait myself.  
But report first, then fun.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Based on my observation of this land from the sea,  
I don't have a single clue of where we are.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
The alignment of the stars in the sky makes no sense.  
It doesn't help pinpoint our location at all.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Any other information?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Ah, cripes, me vission is getting blurry...  
All the blood rushin' elsewhere?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...The open ocean... High, battering waves... Even the tide is complicated and mysterious. Impossible for any ship to make a decent journey.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
And then... (cough cough) ...Oh, it's my fav doujin! What's it doin' here? I thought I lost it... Shiver me timbers!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Hey! Please don't voyage into the afterlife before you've told us everything!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Reward... If I only had my reward... I could hang in there...  
  
   
**Mary:**   
I guess we don't have a choice. ...Oh, Blackbeard.  
I'm so impressed that you made it back here.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
(monotone) Nice recon. You're the greatest pirate that ever sailed. I'm so in awe. Yay.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Uh... Y-Yay...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mary just reached out to the trembling Blackbeard... and he responded...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Like a high-five.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
There, you touched me. That's your one touch.  
I held my end of the bargain, now keep talking.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...Ooooh... Oooooh...!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Even while I'm trembling in despair, you appeal to me with the touch of a wee, soft palm.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Despair... Aye, despair! I, the fearsome Blackbeard, will show you all the true meaning of despair!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He's suddenly gone into serious mode!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
“Despair”?  
   
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Heh heh, heh heh heh. I figured it out after investigating this land from the sea. The final conclusion&mdash;  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
This is... a desert island!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Haha lololol. A desert island... Impossible to escape...  
A harem lifestyle's inevitable. Men'll be mobbed by the ladies!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...And yet... And yet, why...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I'm the one who worked the hardest, yet I can't participate!? That's like, RNG luck!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
You've trampled on my dearest wish! May my blood stain this woooorrrld! May the Holy G-Cup be cursed!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Strange... I suddenly feel a deep affinity to him...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...How unfortunate.  
He didn't make it after all.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Going by what he said, it doesn't sound like a normal ocean. And... a desert island...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Communications with Chaldea are down... and it's just us, on a desert island in the middle of who-knows-where.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Just...  
Just what are we supposed to do in a situation like this?  
  
   
## Section 2: "Life is Beautiful"  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Uggghhh... Once I heard there was no one here, I think this island started to feel even hotter.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I think foxes shine brightest when there's snow and cold, don't you, Master?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
My poor tail is soaked with sweat.  
You know what I'm talking about, right, Fou?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
The food we took with us when we left is almost gone.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Even if we just use it to keep Master alive, who knows how much is left...  
  
   
**Anne:**   
The way you shiver when you realize there's a long time till you hit port, and you're almost out of food...  
  
   
**Anne:**   
It reminded me of that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I should've studied how to get by when you arrive on a deserted island with nothing.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wh-What do we do?  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Don't worry.  
There's no need to think too much about it.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm sure it'll work itself out.  
   
**Scáthach:**   
That's right. No need to think too much about it, Mash.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Scáthach... Do you have a plan?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I don't know if you could call it a plan, but we have to do what we must.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Our first priority needs to be to try and contact Chaldea.  
And then we can request help.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes... That's right. But the problem is that we can't get through. I don't think the system is broken...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Is it possible that if we leave this island and go elsewhere, the system will come back online?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foufou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's... a possibility.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We lost the connection once we arrived on this island, so if we leave, it might be restored.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But if we can't leave the island...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We mustn't forget Blackbeard's noble sacrifice...  
  
   
**Anne:**   
I think a good way to start may be trying to find a way off this place.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Yeah. Blackbeard told us that an ordinary ship wouldn't be enough.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
...Which means that a good, proper ship just might.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
But...this island is uninhabited, right?  
Surely we wouldn't be able to procure such a ship?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
We can make one.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Come again?  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I said we can make one, Master.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is a ship something you can...make?  
   
  
   
**Anne:**   
We may be able to steer a ship...  
But we don't know how to make one.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Don't worry. I know a thing or two about it.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
By combining my runes, I can make almost anything.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I need time, and materials, though.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
S-So dependable!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
As far as I can tell, this island should have what we need.  
It seems very bountiful.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Thus, we probably don't need to worry about resources.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...It's the monsters that surprise me. I didn't expect to see this many stomping around like they own the place.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
An island's supposed to have a ruler, see.  
Be it human, beast, or god.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
So either the ruler has abandoned his duties, or he has forgotten them... It's a sad thing, either way.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That was... Fou's subtle warning that monsters are approaching!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, they're back! Stop talking and help!  
Damn it! It's so hot in this armor!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
That's what you get for wearing such heavy protection.  
It's foolish to try and dress up to intimidate an opponent.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
You should take this opportunity to pick armor that suits your frame. Of course, even if you do&mdash;  
  
   
**Altria:**   
That still won't be enough to bring your grade as a knight above negative.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Grrrrrr...!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Either way, we can talk more after we beat them into the ground... I mean, drive them off!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Scáthach:**   
All right, where were we?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
It's going to take time to build a ship.  
It's not something you can do in an afternoon.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Our goal&mdash;  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Needs to be to find a way to live on this island while we gather the materials we need.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Live here?  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. I'm a little worried about that too.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Materials?  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Wood, stone, iron... Other things as well. Don't worry.  
I can modify them once I have them.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm more worried about living here.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
The climate and topography here are both completely different from that in Chaldea. Who knows what kind of natural phenomena we might encounter?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It is also unclear what we'll face with the environment. And there's the problem of food and water... Will we be okay?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Don't worry. I can make almost anything you need&ndash;including ships.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Some of the knowledge I've acquired includes how to survive, even on an uninhabited island.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
If you need anything, you can count on me.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
It might be inconvenient at first, but as we make what we need, life will get easier.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Heh. It'll be a form of training.  
You'll need to give it your all.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Now then.  
I have a suggestion for everyone&mdash;  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm. Not bad.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What do you mean!? It's great!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What do you mean!? It's great!  
   
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
U-U-Um! Scáthach?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wh-Why... swimsuits?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Why? First, this island is hot.  
Even if you're not wearing armor like Mordred.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Too much heat dulls the body, even if you're a Servant. And the heat affects you in combat too.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
A master warrior must adjust their appearance to match their location and conditions.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I've altered your Spirit Origins to accommodate our surroundings. It's not bad, is it?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Ya got that right. It's nice and cool, and easier to move around. Hehe.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I can swing my sword around more than usual now. Without my armor, I may be stronger than King Arthur!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Hmm. I need to prepare appropriate weapons for this outfit.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I think I still have what I picked up that one time at Waku Waku. A knight must always have the most appropriate weapon.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
(What is that!? She took out this weird gun like it was the most ordinary thing in the world!)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
(And it looks really summery, too! That's not fair!)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, right. I need to change my weapon too!  
I'll bring out this special item I've been saving!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
(Yeah, it's gotta be this: the shield that also becomes King Arthur's ship... I'm glad I swiped it!)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Those two aren't talking to each other, but they are.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm not getting in between them...  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master. Their relationship is extremely complicated, and who knows what will happen if you get involved.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's best to just go with the flow and watch what happens.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Come take a look at me.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
If you can't endure the heat, enjoy the heat.  
If the sun is strong, then use the sunlight...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
That's the way of a proper lady.  
What do you think, Master?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I can use my parasol as a spear, and become Lancer Tamamo-chan! ♡  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hehe! I'm in a swimsuit!  
On a tropical island! With Master!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
We're not just stuck here.  
We're not just stranded on an empty island.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
For me and Master, this is...yes...  
This is our honeymoon...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hehe...hehehe...hehehehehehe...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
It's a little embarrassing to show so much skin...  
But I can't help it.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Given the situation, I must forget my role as a saint, and deal with this trouble as just plain old Martha.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I've never done anything like this.  
It's a little exciting, isn't it?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
I spend a lot of time on the water, but it's been a while since I've dressed up to swim.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Master, do I look weird?  
  
   
**Anne:**   
It's very cute, and it looks great on you, Mary♪  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're all such free spirits...  
   
**Fou:**   
Foufou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. When she said swimsuits, I was thinking competition ones. You all look great!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Blush and look away)  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hey, Master.  
No one minds if you look at their swimsuit.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
If you weren't allowed to look at it, it would be no different than being naked.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Averting your gaze is no different than refusing to look someone in the eye when you speak. It's rude.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
And so I say to you: gaze upon it all!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(That seems like an amazing thing to say...)  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
I agree that a swimsuit is better suited for this environment.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But my one concern&mdash;  
  
   
**???:**  
...!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I understand.  
It's whether we can fight in these outfits or not, right?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
No need to worry. Even in our tropical island versions, we're still powerful Servants.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
This is true even if our classes have changed due to our unfamiliarity with swimsuits.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Now then, Master, your orders!  
I shall show you the power of summer!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry. To be honest I didn't really believe it, but... way to go, everyone!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
That battle was an offering I made to our future together... Did you see it, Master?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
It's fun to have a different role than usual.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
I agree, Mary.  
This isn't a bad change of pace.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
All right! I landed a nasty strike right on their body!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
The beach really does make things feel more exciting! Not having my staff does make me a little uneasy, though! (Fwoosh fwoosh)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Even as she said that, Martha was shadowboxing...)  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
...Heh. Fate must truly love me.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Everything's going my way...  
That's just how things work out for me.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Don't you think so, Diarmuid?  
By the way, which one is your type?  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
I hope you don't like the same one I do. Like what happened with Gráinne. Or what happened with Gráinne.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Um, well... that's kind of a hard question to answer...  
I couldn't say, really...  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Also, I don't know why you had to say that twice.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Hahah! Don't worry. It was just a joke.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
The thing with Gráinne was just something the people around me set up. To be honest, I was surprised too.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
But this time, conditions are the same for both of us.  
It's a fair fight, I guess you could say.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
No, that's not right. It's not fair.  
You've got that Love Spot!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
You're going to show it off by winking at all of them, aren't you?  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Wink! Wink!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
I'll do nothing of the sort! Moreover, I would ask that you, my liege, keep your thumb out of your mouth!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's right, the guys are here, too...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Um, where are your swimsuits?  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Don't worry about it.  
Diarmuid's basically wearing a swimsuit already.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Even if the girls' outfits have changed, our position hasn't. You just focus on the girls.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Yes, that's right. I agree.  
We men will do our best not to stand out.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
...Sheesh. My mentor's pretending to be calm, but she's more excited than anyone.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
She didn't need to change too...  
That combat outfit was water-resistant anyway.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
That settles it. I'm staying as far away from her as possible. I'm not getting close. Forget about the beach.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I'm going to the mountains.  
Maybe I'll plant a field or something...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foufou.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What happens now?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This is going to be thrilling in a lot of ways...  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. But I think the basic plan is just as Scáthach said.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Our goal needs to be to get resources to escape.  
And to survive until we do.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
For that to happen, I think we're going to need to build some new facilities.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At first, it's going to be hard, I think&mdash;  
But I'll support you with everything I have.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'll help you make the escape ship, and I'll help you make our life here better.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's search this island and gather materials and supplies!  
  
   
## Section 3: "Food Fighter"  
   
**Mash:**   
We built a place to live, and a place for water.  
I thought we were doing well, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is the biggest mistake I've ever made.  
How could I have not noticed?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...We're almost out of food.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Servants don't need to eat.  
If anything, food is like a mood stabilizer for us.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
However, that's not the case for Master...  
This is a big problem. How did you guys get by so far?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We've been eating the rations we brought from Chaldea, but they're about to run out as well.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We tried to conserve them, but...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I guess they had to run out eventually...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
That just means... we'll have to procure food ourselves.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
A lack of food is a serious issue. It doesn't just affect our Master, but it lowers our morale as well.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I thought Scáthach might be able to help, but I haven't seen her for a while...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So for now, we'll have to rely on ourselves.  
Let's see if we can find something to eat!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Hmm... all the plants are so different from the ones in Bethany. I'm not sure which ones are safe to eat...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
But alas, it is best to remain calm in situations like this. Nothing will go wrong if we stick to our instincts.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(I'm nervous...)  
   
**Martha:**   
Humph. Master, why do you look so nervous?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(I have a bad feeling about this...)  
   
**Martha:**   
Humph. Master, why do you look like you have a bad feeling about this?  
  
   
  
   
**Martha:**   
There's no need to worry. I used to feed all kinds of weird things to my little brothers, and they were mostly fine.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
In fact, they prayed even harder after they ate.  
They even had tears in their eyes when they did.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
The look on all those tough little boys' faces reminded me of how He prayed over the suffering and sins of mankind.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
So don't worry. And don't disobey me. My gut feeling is pretty good at times like this, you know?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(I don't know what their tears really meant, but I do know that whenever that happened, Martha didn't eat any of those things herself!)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
F-For now, I'll get going!  
Please wait for me, Master!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm sorry, Master.  
I should've read up on how to survive outdoors.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I could barely find anything... All I managed to do was bring Fou back with me. He was wandering around over there.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
...?  
Fo... Fou!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Looks like Fou just realized something!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, th-that's not what I meant, Fou!  
I brought you back here because you're fluffy and fun.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I didn't bring you back here for your calories!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I can't say I found much either...  
Just a few different kinds of fruit.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ooh... Well done! What are they?  
I've never seen these shapes and colors before.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
... (Grin)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh no! I don't trust your instincts!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
You've got a problem with my instincts!?  
It's never been wrong! It's fine!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They all look like coconuts... but upon closer inspection, one has thorns, one is fluorescent pink...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And one smells terrible... I'm getting kind of worried.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
At the very least, I don't think you'll die instantly from eating them. Just spit it out if your tongue feels numb, got that?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Do the same if your stomach feels strange after you swallow.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
If you're having trouble regurgitating it, let me know.  
I'll use a special method to, um, knock it right out of you.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foooou!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Ahem. Anyway, that will tell us whether it's something ominous and deadly, at least.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
As a saint, I can swear that to you.  
Trust me.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Okay, looks like you have no objections, so let's get started. Go ahead, Master.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(So I really have to eat these on my own...?)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
O-Of course, I'll try them with you, Senpai.  
We're in this together.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, but wait. These look like coconuts, so their shells must be made like coconuts too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'll go get something to cut this open&mdash;  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Haiiee-yaah!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She chopped the top off... with... just her hand!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Okay, you should be able to drink from it now.  
No need to thank me.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Okay... here I go... GWAH!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-This is... It's spicy! Just as you'd expect from something covered in thorns! It's spicier than a habanero!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
My whole body started to sweat instantly!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Well that's a shame. Still, I suppose it'll make some good seasoning... Anyway, let's try the pink one next.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
MATTHEW!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
H-Here I go... Uwagh!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...It's tasteless. It's completely tasteless!  
And the texture is all weird and dry.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If I had to compare it to something...  
It's like eating an eraser.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's probably okay if it's nutritious... but it's not something I'd eat on my own... ever...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Huh? That's strange.  
Normally, at least one thing I find turns out to be edible.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Maybe my intuition's grown dull...  
Well, on to the last one.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
MOSES!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
O-Okay, let's try this... Mgaaghh...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Hey, why aren't you saying anything!?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I'm pretending not to notice the horrible stench that came after I opened it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is... It's edible. I... guess.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
What? Then it's fine, right?  
What's with that look on your face?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I guess the best way to describe the taste is...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Spicy salted squid.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Fermented soybeans.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It really doesn't taste like something... that you'd expect from a fruit...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I suppose you could eat it... if you forced yourself to.  
But that actually just makes it all the more disgusting.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
But it IS edible, right?  
That means more choice in an emergency. Good.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I have to say, Fujimaru, Mash,  
you're both too picky anyway.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
People in the past ate things that tasted a lot worse, you know. Just be grateful to the Lord that your food tastes like anything at all.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(That didn't sound very convincing.)  
  
   
**Martha:**   
But to tell you the truth, it wasn't just instinct this time. There was a reason that I thought this last one might be safe to eat.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What's that?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I saw a crab eating one that fell on the ground.  
It wouldn't do that if it was poisonous, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doesn't that mean, though... that it's crab food?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...That's right.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And we're spreading this smell everywhere.  
Which means...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I knew it! There they are!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh, more hungry lost lambs over there, too.  
Maybe they're in the same situation we are...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But let's take them out before we get eaten, Master!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't think Master's food shortage can be solved with those mysterious fruits.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Considering the taste and the fact that enemies attack every time we bite into one... At most, we can use it as emergency rations.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As for other sources of food... well...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh no, I didn't know we were in that much trouble.  
I guess we don't even have any bread.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
...? I'm sorry, but I can't help you even if you keep staring at me like that, Master. I wish I could be of some help...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Huh? You were all looking for some food?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I'm just about to go freshwater fishing.  
Wanna come with me?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Fishing, huh? That does sound like a solution.  
But I have no experience... Besides, what about the equipment...?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
What, are you afraid you won't be able to reel any in? Don't worry, the best thing about fishing is even a beginner can catch some.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I can make rods for you. One each for Mash and Fujimaru, right? Piece of cake!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
As expected of a member of The Backspears Boys!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okay, everyone! We're all going fishing!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I've never been fishing myself,  
but it sounds like so much fun!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Freshwater style? Oh, what refined taste! There's no way I can pass this up. It'll be like summer vacation in Japan all over again!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I was thinking to go find some wild grass for Master, but you changed my mind. I'd like to come with you, too.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Wow, got a lot more people now... Gotta make four more rods, huh? Well, I don't mind. The more the merrier!  
That's fishing for ya!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Uh, I see.  
So this squirming thing is the bait...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Yep. Recommended for beginners, too.  
Once you get enough experience, you can do without it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can you put it on yourself, Mash?  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I'll try!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you want me to put it on for you, Mash?  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
N-No, I'm fine. Thank you though.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can manage something like this by myself.  
I don't want to cause you any trouble!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
...You put it on a hook like this...  
It's okay, Mash, just relax...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I did it! I did it, Senpai!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good job! Headpats for you...  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, no... you don't have to... I only did what everyone else should be able to do... I was just too inexperienced...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Now let's go fishing!  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I'll try my best!  
  
   
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Fishing is a hit-or-miss business.  
Taking it easy is the right manner to enjoy it.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Sitting next to Master, looking out over the water together as time passes us by...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
For me, that alone is enough.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Fishing can be such an elegant, upscale pastime as well.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Oh, I see someone here gets it. I agree with you.  
I guess knowledge does come with age.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Twagh! I-I dare you to say that to Scáthach as well!  
And you know what? How about you DROP DEAD!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oops, well, pardon me☆  
Today, Tamamo is elegant and classic☆  
  
   
**Marie:**   
This is my first time... It's okay to try without bait, right?  
Maybe I'll go ahead and do just that.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I meant it's okay for experienced fishermen like myself, though... Well, anyway, up to you.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Like what Miss Fox there said, you should be fine as long as you give it a try and keep a line dropped.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Well, Master, let's sit back and enjoy ourselves.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm quite serious here. We must catch some big fish so Senpai can get some proper nutrients!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can't catch any at all...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Try to hide your presence, Shieldy.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Mmmm... It's soooo frustrating...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Though I said spending time with Master would be enough, the fact that it is taking so long to catch something is making me a little...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
What, are you giving up already?  
You're less patient than I thought you were.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
You haven't caught any yet, either!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I'm fine because I'm enjoying the process.  
Besides, I'm not hungry yet.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...It might be a problem with the rod. Maybe I should get in the stream directly and try my luck at spearfishing like a true Lancer would...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh. That's not good. A sophisticated woman wouldn't do that, and to be frank, it's a job more suited for the Cat...!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I, as a fancy mannequin, cannot stoop to that level!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Also, it seems you haven't noticed yet, so I'm gonna tell ya. The princess over there caught something.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The princess over there...?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
...Here you go! Hehe, I've just caught another one.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
...Oh, look at you, staring at me with those  
“Don't eat me!” eyes... All right, all right.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I'll let you go, so don't get caught ever again, okay?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
That's what she's been doing for the whole time. Looks as if fish come willingly to get caught. So being unselfish is the secret of fishing after all?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't think ANY fish have “Eat me!” eyes, Marie...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait, something is wrong.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Look at that bend of the rod!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Eek! Wh-What is...this...?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
A big one!? Let me give you a hand!  
I'm coming right now, so hang in there!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
We should help her out, too!  
It looks kind of fun!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I feel I'll be dragged into the river if I lose my concentration...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All together now! One, two, three!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Good! I see it now! One more should do it!  
Here we go now!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
It's a whopper of a fish!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Hmm... Definitely not “Don't eat me!” eyes.  
Would you say this one looks like it wants to eat us?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
What on earth have you reeled in!?  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I guess I'll hang around and help you look for food. After inviting you all out on that unsuccessful fishing trip, it's the least I can do.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, thank you, Cú Chulainn.  
Your help means a lot to us.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
...You know, the normal way to “procure food” is to hunt.  
So, let's go hunting!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
I see, so that's why you asked us to tag along.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
This'll be a walk in the park.  
...Oh, Your Majesty. Why are you here?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
It's useless asking me that question. Hunting is a knight's hobby. Especially since I am an Archer now. I will not let any prey escape me.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
It would be perfect if my trustworthy horses Llamrei and Dun Stallion were here. My hound Cavall too.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Well, well, let's see how good you are then. Oh, I just got a glimpse of a deer in the lee of the mountain right over there.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
What shall we do? Should I have Mary chase the deer so I can shoot at it when it jumps out&mdash;  
  
   
**Altria:**   
No, let me try this time around. I would like to warm up since I have not been hunting for a while.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Now, watch me.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Ex&mdash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
!?!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Stop! Stooooop!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Don't you “what” me! What the hell are you doing?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Well. When your game hides in the lee of a mountain or a dense forest...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...then completely eradicating the surroundings would be one way to get at it, wouldn't it?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
It's not something I always do, you know?  
...There are times when I need to, though. That's all.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Child of Light, am I breaking Celtic hunting etiquette in some way?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
This goes way beyond simple etiquette!  
No one bothered to bring it up to you?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Don't be ridiculous.  
Are you saying this is an absurd thing to do?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
When Agravain came with me on hunts, he would say with his lifeless eyes, “Impressive, Your Majesty. You certainly gave it your all.”  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Are you saying that was all just lip service?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, not lip service per se... How should I put it...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wow, so ex(tra), much calibur... Nothing, I said nothing.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wow, the king thinks big.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
A-Anyway, we should ban the use of Noble Phantasms.  
Let us deal with that deer.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Come on, Anne. It's hunting time!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Yes, ma'am♪  
Let's show everyone how skilled we are!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As expected of Altria!  
Birds... rabbits... you caught a lot!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Well, I did pretty good for a class I'm not used to.  
You did a good job, too, Mash.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Anne is good at shooting birds, too. I mean, out on the open sea, that's the only target there is.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
For the time being, this game should be enough.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So Anne and Mary shot the deer... That's wonderful.  
This was a good hunt!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I think all this should temporarily solve our problem with food shortage...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...Cú Chulainn. Is that spear of yours an ornament?  
You looked like you slept through the whole thing.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Hmph. I was thinking about lending a hand, but I sniffed something out, so I was thinking about that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sniffed something out?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
See, here comes a big one.  
Looks like this is its hunting field, too!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Seeing as how we snatched its prey, it's not like we can slip away quietly.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I'll pay the hunting fees with a thrust of this spear!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Sign:**   
- The First Ever Happy BBQ Fiesta for Master Fujimaru & Servants -  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not opposed to the idea of having a barbecue, considering all the extra meat we got...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But still, that sign seems very unnecessary...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
No, no! What's important is the feel of it,  
the atmosphere!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hm. Meat roasted over rune fire sure has a unique taste... (munch munch)  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
We were wondering where you went, but didn't think you'd be off hunting alone... So much for us running around.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
She did come back with a huge deer on her back.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yes, and now we have so much meat we can't even finish...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She already noticed that we were short on food...  
She's so amazing...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, Master... I cannot believe I did not notice you were starving. Shame on me.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
The next time you cannot bear your hunger any longer, will you please let me know?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I am prepared to give up this body anytime for you...  
I recommend my tail first.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
W-Well, there's still a lot of meat left right now!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
That is quite true. Then, here, Master. Please have some deer meat that I slowly roasted with my fire.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Say, “aah”...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
“Rune fire” this, “my fire” that...  
Such unfamiliar terms flying around...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I guess starting a fire is a simple task for those two.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Well, they are indeed very talented individuals.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
However, does the flavor actually differ depending on the fire used?  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
I did try to compare them, but with my unsophisticated palate I could not tell.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I agree...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
M-Maybe it's just the feel of it...?  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Well then, how about something like this? Karna? (whisper whisper)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...Understood.  
If that's what the Master desires... I shall be glad to help.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
!!!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Eye beams!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A real hero will roast meat with just their eyes!  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Hahaha.  
This would be charred meat, not chargrilled meat.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
I tried to add to the types of fires, but dear me.  
“More than enough is too much,” I suppose.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...I miscalculated the temperature.  
I apologize, Master.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Hey! Do not waste food!  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Oh, Martha has finally put up her fists! That stance isn't jujitsu... It must be some form of street fighting!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Why are you so happy about it!? I'm not going to hit you just because you over-roasted some meat!  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Really?  
Are you sure?  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...I apologize.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...Nom, nom.  
I have to say, all of the meat tastes great.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
But, as a cooking method, barbecue is simply a bit too sloppy. Surely there's no denying that now?  
  
   
## Section 4: "Catcher in the Farm"  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, Fooou♪  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou is in a good mood too.  
Maybe Fou knows that we're going to harvest the crops.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Harvest... is a good civilization.  
   
**Mash:**   
Heh heh, are you copying Altera, Senpai?  
It does seem like something she would say.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Isn't it exciting?  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. It has a nice ring, “Harvest.”  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
It took us a while to make them, but now that we have some crops, our line of produce has become stable.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yes. However, there's a lot more work ahead for us. First of all, in farming, what's important is the nitrogen in the soil&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Scáthach can really become absorbed in things...)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
(Fou...)  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Hahaha. Your words tend to slip from my ears, queen of the Land of Shadows.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Knights like us couldn't do anything even if you told us about our grandmother's secret in farming.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
We can swing swords, but we knights couldn't swing a hoe right even if we wanted to. The most we could do is help out with the harvesting where it requires power.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Humph. It sounds as if you're calling me a babbling nitpicky old lady...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Am I correct, the guardian of Erin?  
I hope it was me mishearing things... but how about it?  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Of course not, I would never.  
However, if that was how you took it, I am to blame.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
I was told that I was not good at reading the room...  
Isn't that right, Diarmuid?  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Yes... No, um... Yes...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(He's struggling over the fact he can't confirm nor deny the claim!)  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
But Fionn mac Cumhaill, you are a hero of the Celt.  
I hear you hold some superior wisdom, do you not?  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
As I mentioned earlier, farming is not my specialty.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
I'm sure if I think hard enough, I could find a way to maintain the crops. However, I did not think of using my thumb for this.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
If we were facing a serious matter where my wisdom was required, then I would not mind using my thumb of course.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hm. Well, if that happens, I'll look forward to it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway, the crops have become an important asset to us. We'd like to take good care of them.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is... Our crops have been destroyed!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A... Another “bad civilization” matter!?  
   
**Mash:**   
Calm down, Master, Altera is not on this island!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What kind of monster would do this!?  
   
**Mash:**   
Please calm down, Senpai.  
This island have nothing but monsters!  
  
   
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I wouldn't say it's completely destroyed.  
But more than half for sure... What happened?  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
There are monsters near by! Is it them!?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm... I cast runes around the field so no beasts could bring harm to it. It is a mystery indeed.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Anyway, we need to rid the enemies before us.  
Let us investigate after we have defeated them!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I've cut the beast's bowel open, but I did not find our crops. The true culprit lies elsewhere.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then what happened?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I don't know.  
If only we had some clues...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Well then, let's search for some. We'll use them to investigate the cause of the damage and, if possible, rid ourselves of it.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hm. Oh, yes. I know just the man for the job...  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
That look... Hah, so it's already time to put my wisdom into use!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Very well. It is not something I usually openly show, but I guess it was meant to be.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Now, behold the wisdom that flows from within me.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Ohh... It is coming! The Noble Phantasm, said to have come from the oil that flicked onto the thumb of my master from the Salmon of Knowledge!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Fintan Finegas!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That pose... It must be...!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thumb-sucking... Like a baby...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(...Don't laugh, don't laugh...)  
   
  
   
**Fionn:**   
It's here... It has come.  
My mind is becoming very clear!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hm!? This is...  
Yes, I can feel it!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
This is an extremely high DHA response! It's an unbelievably condensed DHA reaction not possible on Earth!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I don't know what I'm saying myself, but the analyzing skill obtained from the Wisdom of Dún Scáith is telling me that!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Phew... Good. Everyone, salmon is very good.  
Let us all eat salmon.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Normally, blue-backed fish contain a higher percentage of DHA than salmon. But what on earth is this... Salmon of Wisdom...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-Anyway, Fionn.  
Did you find anything?  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Yes. First of all... we have firm evidence that some kind of beast destroyed our crops.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
A clear mind is sensitive to smell as well.  
The faint smell of an animal can support my claim.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
There is no mistake. The culprit is a beast, not a human. From the footprints, it is likely a four-legged beast.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou!? Fooou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's all right, Fou, nobody thinks you're the culprit here.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
And also... Yes, I see, I see.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
After analyzing everything,  
we're only left with one option.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wow! And what might that be?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Salmon DHA is just awesome...  
   
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Diarmuid, we must stay up and watch over this crop field. What came before will come again.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Say that again? ...Yes, my liege.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You mean... act as a lookout?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Wait. Did you find out who the culprit was?  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
No. I did not.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...What?  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
The culprit is a beast.  
But I do not know what kind or where it is right now.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
So we have to see it with our own eyes...  
That's the answer my wisdom has led me to.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
My wisdom can help me solve mysteries, but it can't unconditionally tell me something completely unknown.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
If that were the case, I would have already known about this island or how to get back to Chaldea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well... that's true.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Now wait a minute. You're thinking that was just a normal conclusion and that I didn't need to use my Noble Phantasm, aren't you?  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
...Wrong. I did need to.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
We must stay up and watch over the crop field...  
That was the conclusion I came to after analyzing all the clues. That's the important part.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? I'm sorry, I still don't understand...  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Good grief. Then let me whisper it into your ear.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
There are many attractive, scantily clad women on this island. It's not just you and Lady Scáthach here.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
To be honest, I was thinking it's probably about time for me to run into some kind of lady trouble at night.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Therefore, I am doing this to also keep us away from the ladies and cool down for a bit. I think.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I see...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hey. Do you need help with the lookout?  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Oh, no, leave this to the glorious Knights of Fianna.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I see. Then that's what we shall do.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't really understand... But it seems Fionn and Diarmuid have their own troubles to deal with... I mean, their own way of showing consideration.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
For now, let's leave it to them for tonight, and come back tomorrow to take a look at the crops, Master.  
  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Scáthach:**   
The night is through.  
I wonder if the field is all right.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I see, so that happened.  
How sad.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
It's absolutely reprehensible that someone would destroy a field. It's a felony in my country. Someone is going to have to pay for this.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Master and I gazed into each others' eyes while we worked on the crops, watching as the pistils and stamens came together...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
In other words, they were like our children!  
So to assault them like that... Unforgivable!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
You wanted anyone who had some free time to come along, but is it really necessary for me to be here?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I know you're probably going to say it's part of a knight's duties to patrol one's territory, but...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...But I thought we said just the two of us... Maybe not... Eh, who cares anyway.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yep, it doesn't matter!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
With these numbers, we can handle anything.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Lots of people for a simple field visit...  
   
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
To be fair, we let Fionn and Diarmuid, two people with extensive combat experience, watch over the field.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...As such, this isn't about bolstering defenses. I think everyone just wants to check on the field since they have a stake in it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We're almost there.  
Let's ask those two how things went last night.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
H-He's dead!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...It's a mortal wound.  
There's nothing we can do.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Looks like he's barely hanging in there.  
...Hey! He's trying to say something!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Oh, it's you... I've made a grave mistake...  
If they got to me first, no amount of water would...help...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh... Fionn...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...And what about this one?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Diarmuid! Diarmuid Ua Duibhne!  
Get a hold of yourself!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
...Argh...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What's wrong!? Who could've done this to a great warrior like yourself!?  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
...B...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
B?  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
...A b-boar...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fionn... Diarmuid...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This island has taken yet another life!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I've confirmed the departure of both Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Their Spirit Origins are still intact, so I think you can just resummon them when we're back in Chaldea...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
We can grieve later.  
Did you hear what he said with his dying words?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
If I'm not mistaken... I think he said “boar.”  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yep, he did.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
That's what I heard as well.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Boar... As in the animal?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Who knows? The pig-looking mammal...  
That's the only kind of boar that came to my mind...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Hm? Over there!  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
...Oink!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...It's a boar.  
   
**Mash:**   
...That it is. Just a regular boar.  
Cute, in fact...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So maybe we should call it a boar piglet?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...A boar piglet.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master. A cute baby boar...  
That'd make it a piglet.  
  
   
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hm. Piglet or not, it's still a boar.  
There's no question about that.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Don't tell me that Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne were killed by this thing?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
That just can't be, can it?  
Look at it... So tiny and adorable.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
No. Unfortunately, we have all the evidence we need here. First, this is a crime scene.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Second, the dying Diarmuid even said himself that the culprit was a boar.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
We have no choice but to suspect the animal. It is the most basic rule of combat to not get fooled by your enemy's appearance.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I think it goes without saying, but boars are typically harmful to crops. Their existence won't be beneficial to us either way.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
That's true. You often hear of farmers trying hard to drive them off their lands.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Just because something's small, doesn't make it weak.  
You don't know until you try.  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
... (tremble)  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Hey! Your scary glaring is making this little one frightened!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
It's okay, here, I have some nuts for you.  
Come on, come on... There's a good boy.  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
...O-Oink...?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Don't do it, Marie! You mustn't underestimate the strength of a charging boar!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
It might just be a child, but it's got meaty...  
Yes, it's got meaty legs with a nice layer of fat on top!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
You need to be careful.  
We should all surround it and finish it off.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I agree. If this piglet really did violate the product of love that is our crops, our children, then... Heh, heh.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
We can't just let it get away, now, can we?  
How should we cook it? Medium? Rare? Well-done?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Come on! Just take a look at its eyes. They're beautiful eyes. This little one hasn't done anything wrong!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
You think so too, right, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You have to punish it for its crimes.  
   
**Marie:**   
You're going to go that far too, Master?  
Boo...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Boar piglets sure are cute...  
   
**Marie:**   
Right? Aren't they?  
  
   
  
   
**Marie:**   
...Oh! Of course! If there was something to feel guilty about, it would have run far away from here by now!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
The fact that it's sitting here like this is all the proof you need that it's innocent&mdash;  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
O... Oink!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What were you saying? It's running off at full speed!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What acceleration!  
I'm not going to underestimate you, piglet!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Hmm? There must be a reason for its flight.  
  
   
**???:**  
GURRR...!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Monsters at a time like this!? The piglet must have been driven away by their stench and murderous aura!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
In any event, we can't let it get away with destroying our field. We'll pursue it once we take care of these beasts!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
...“Split up and look for it,” huh...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
This is a pretty big island. If we lost sight of it during the battle then who knows how far it's gone...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Father&ndash;I mean King Arthur&ndash;seriously works other people too hard. I guess he really doesn't understand people's feelings... Yep yep.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Ya know what, I am done! What's the point of looking this hard anyway? It's not like I'm gonna get rewarded or anything!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I'm just gonna go back and say I couldn't find anything... Hmm?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
What's that in the bushes?  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oink...!?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Looky here! Got ya!  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
... (tremble)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
... (tremble tremble)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
... (Glance)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, so what?  
You know me or something?  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
...?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hah! If you don't then make sure you remember this name. I am the Treacherous Knight, Mordred.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
A disgusting order from a disgusting king...  
Of course I'm gonna rebel against it!  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oink... (hug)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, you're surprisingly soft...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
All right! Feels great to ignore the king's orders!  
Maybe I'll head to the beach and ride some waves!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh yeah, I got some nuts from Marie to help lure out the target, but I don't need them at all.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I guess I'll get rid of them here.  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oink... (Sniff, sniff)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Someone or something might just find these and eat them, but oh well, I don't care. I suppose doing so will fill them up a bit, though...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Don't come to the field again, got that?  
Well, I'm just talking to myself. See ya.  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
...  
  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I see, I see... So that's what happened while I was relaxing on the beach.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I suppose that means I have no choice but to help you watch the field.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
I don't know a lot about how things work on land, but can't we just harvest the rest of the crops?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
We might be able to do that now, but if our next patch of crops also gets eaten then we'll be in trouble.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
We either need to eliminate the root cause completely...  
Or come up with a solid defense.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
So we need to think about the future, huh?  
That makes sense, I guess.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
It's true, we can't ignore this issue. Although I do question your story about how those two got defeated by boars...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Exactly. I still don't believe these little ones are the culprits. I am here to prove that.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I'll tell you again: you shouldn't underestimate boars.  
I remember there was once a terrifying boar in Britain.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I just remembered.  
The reason Diarmuid died in his legend was also...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Gored by a boar... So it's his second time, huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's famous for being a hero killed by boars...  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
...No. For the sake of Diarmuid's honor, let's not talk about things we can't be sure about.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's not certain that he really was killed by a boar, anyway.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Hmm... I was just thinking about Cú Chulainn's face when he said, “I'm going to protect our base. You handle the field.”  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Did you see it?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Yeah. He had a sad look in his eyes.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
It's like they were saying, “If I, a fellow Celtic male, were to defeat that boar... it would cause him great shame...”  
  
   
**Martha:**   
He may look violent, but he can be quite nice...  
And compared to him, that stupid samurai...!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
“A boar? It doesn't clone itself, or go backwards in time, or split space or anything like that, right?”  
  
   
**Martha:**   
“I'm not interested in it at all.”  
  
   
**Martha:**   
He doesn't care about his friends at all, does he!?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Everyone, enough talking.  
Something's getting closer.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...I'm certain it's something that wants to destroy this symbol of the love between Master and me.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Hmm. So it's here, huh?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Even a fancy lady like me can be a little bit of a wild animal at night!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
In other words... it's hunting time.  
Let's get rid of this pest!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I knew it!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But I believed in you...!  
   
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foufou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What's wrong, Fou? I know you're excited to be around another small animal, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wait? Huh?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
There's more than one!?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh my! They're even cuter when there's more of them!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Yes! I smell blood in the water!  
...Hmm?  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Wait. Something seems strange.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
They're all lining up on top of each other...It's as if they're protecting our field, isn't it?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Wait! Something else is here!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Something jumped out and knocked down the wall of boar piglets!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is that...  
  
   
**???:**  
Grwaaffhh!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Well, well... It's a demon boar.  
A regular boar with a demon inside.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...A demon boar?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that what attacked Diarmuid?  
   
**Altria:**   
It's very likely, Master.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
From the looks of it, it has enough power to be a match for a Servant.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
If they were caught off guard, even the two Knights of Fianna could be defeated.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It looks like it wants to eat us!  
   
**Altria:**   
Do you see now why I told you not to underestimate boars, Master?  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Demon boars... They don't show up as often as dragons, but they are common creatures in heroes' stories.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Indeed. Demon boars are trials for a hero. Heroes who aren't strong enough are killed without mercy.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I used to send my own students up against them all the time.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
They're a very eco-friendly enemy, because you can eat them once they're dead.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
The one in front of us right now has a little too much fat to be a good opponent, though...  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oink!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh... no! Stop bullying them, you meanie!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Marie went to fight it!  
We have to go, too!  
  
   
**Demon Boar:**   
GRRRRAAAARGH...?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Look at those scraps of food around its mouth.  
Those are from our field, right?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
It seems the thing that ransacked our field just confessed.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
And it looks like it wants to eat us, too!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Bring it on! If it wants a fight I'll smash it into the freaking sky! ...Uh, I mean... yeah.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Unfortunately, I must resist against your act of violence. The reward for sinning is death, haven't you heard?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Begone! If you will not, I will show you a new meaning to “Bible thumping”!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Altria:**   
It's quite powerful, however...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Hahh!  
  
   
**Demon Boar:**   
GRRRRAAAARGH... GRRRAAAARTHUR...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...? Did it just...?  
Did I imagine that?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good work, everyone!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's the end for that boar!  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Hehe.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is it?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, nothing. I was just thinking how that's something the doctor would say...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It just reminded me...  
I haven't heard his voice in a long while.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, no. It isn't anything that serious.  
I mean, we will be off the island soon anyway.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Really, he just popped into my head somehow, that's all... In any event, we were able to protect the field, so we have no problems here.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Yes, Mash. It was pretty strong, but I'm glad we won.  
To think there are boars like that on this island...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...I am sorry, Marie.  
You were correct.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I have to apologize too. We jumped to conclusions and assumed the boar piglets were the culprits.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Knowing you're wrong and not admitting to it is the same as lying. And I hate lying.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Hehehe. It doesn't bother me.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
And if you're going to apologize, apologize to the little ones you chased... Huh?  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oink, oiiiink!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh my! Oh my! Hehehe!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh, that's right... You were protecting our crops from the demon boar, weren't you?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
You knew you couldn't win, and you still tried your hardest anyway... Why?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Probably because you gave them food yesterday, right?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
That demon boar must've been preventing them from getting any food. They would've been starving.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
So they felt like they owed you one...  
Hah. It's like they're knights or something, huh?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
They seem to like you, too.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Wh-Whatever! I don't know what you're talking about! Go on, get lost! Shoo! Shoo!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm... Still, boar piglets are wild animals.  
They're a threat to our crops, too.  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oink oink!?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
But look.  
It seems like they kind of understand human speech.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
We may not have to exterminate them after all; we can use them instead. Let me try this...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What's she doing, crouching down in front of them like that?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...The deal is made. The contract is sealed.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Y-You can talk to them!?  
   
**Scáthach:**   
All I'm doing is imitating Animal Communication.  
The most I can do is get the general feeling.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
It's similar to what you do with that white creature.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, I kind of get the feeling that I can understand what Fou says... sometimes...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What do you mean by “contract”?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
They will leave our field alone.  
And when we're not here, they'll watch over it.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
If another threat like that demon boar shows up, they'll tell us immediately. They'll be a warning system.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
In exchange, we'll give them food. ...What do you say, Master? We can still call the whole thing off...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sounds good to me.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They're our new friends on this island.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh my! I think that's wonderful!  
That means I can pet them all I want, right?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I'm all right with it too.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Giant boars who eat our crops are one thing, but little boar piglets? I'm willing to leave them alone.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Me? I... I don't care. It's your decision, Master.  
Don't ask me.  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oink! Oink♪  
  
   
**Anne:**   
So instead of watchdogs, we've got watch-boars?  
I'm okay with that.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
A ship without rowers isn't going anywhere, they say.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
If Anne and you are okay with it, Master, then so am I.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
(...It makes me feel so much safer to have a ready source of protein nearby...)  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Yes, we've made some very cute friends.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
(He did say, after all, that there were no forbidden foods. If it comes down to it... I don't have a choice, do I...?)  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
...Oink?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Of course, little Tamamo-chan wants whatever her Master wants! But...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I'm sorry. There's one thing I want to make clear...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...Foxes prey on boar piglets.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
At certain times, and in certain conditions... for example, if I was starving and one of them was defenselessly waddling right past me...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I might suddenly find my mouth filled with delicious meat juice! Mmm, so good... I'd better share this with Master... (Gasp!)  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Something like that might happen, so do be careful, okay?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
You see, I'm in summer mode right now, so I'm even more elegant and more of a beast than usual!  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
O-Oink...!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...That's right. I should apologize to you.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Boar piglet, I apologize for chasing you for a crime you didn't commit.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Your courage when you fought that huge boar was real. You deserve praise.  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oink?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Altria...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I hope we'll get along.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Don't be ashamed because the demon boar was oppressing you. You are wonderful.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Yes, even if your bodies are tiny, you're courageous, quick, wonderfully furry, and... and...  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...And strangely enough, just looking at you makes me hungry.  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
...Oiiiiinkkkkk!?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh, jeez! They ran away again...  
You mustn't scare them like that.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I'm sorry. I just said what I was honestly thinking when I saw them, and...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Either way, our field is safe now.  
Let's get back to work.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is there a problem?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's eat when we get back.  
   
**Altria:**   
N-No, Master! I don't just think about food all the time.  
  
   
  
   
**Altria:**   
I was just thinking that this island is huge.  
There may be more than one boar.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
This might not be the end.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I hope I'm wrong, but please keep that in mind&mdash;  
  
   
## Section 5: "Island Detox"  
   
**Mash:**   
We've got a small elite force today, huh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You said there was something we had to check...  
What did you mean, Scáthach?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yes. It's due to a report from that one over there.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Me?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...No, the one in your arms.  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oink, oink.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou. Foou. Foou.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Fou sounds kind of sad...)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Fou sounds kind of upset...)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Maybe he feels like he's been replaced...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hmm. Don't worry, Fou.  
That'll never happen.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Here, come sit in my arms.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
What did this little one say?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
That something strange has been happening on this island. I couldn't just ignore that information.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Somehow I always manage to scare the piglets away just by looking at them.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
It'd be quite troublesome to have my guide always run away from me, obviously. That's why I brought you here.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I see... You are very beautiful, but you always have this stern look on your face.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I'm sure that's just how warriors and knights are, but you're wearing a swimsuit now. You should smile.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She said what we're all thinking!  
   
**Mash:**   
I was thinking the same thing... Somehow she still has a very intimidating look even though she's in a swimsuit.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I guess Scáthach will be the same no matter where she goes.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Also, I think she's still treating the boar piglets like some kind of vermin...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But I like it. I want her to glare at me.  
   
**Marie:**   
Is that how it works?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
  
   
**Marie:**   
...You're the Queen of the Land of Shadows.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
With the amount of responsibility you have, I think you'd be much better off smiling more.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh... Perhaps it's because I've never ruled a nation? Would I be more like you if I did?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
It's just who I am... There's nothing I can do.  
I was, after all, a gatekeeper.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
The Land of Shadows gets all kinds of nasty visitors.  
It was my job to drive them away.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Besides, there are different kinds of queens out there. Medb, for example, is more similar to you than me.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Medb looks like she's having fun every day.  
I actually quite like her.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
But all her talk about love... might just be a little too difficult for me to understand...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
By the way, what am I doing here?  
I mean, if I have a role to play, I don't mind, but still...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Oh, there may be something I want to ask you to do.  
You might be better suited for it than me.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Better suited for it... Do you mean something that needs bare hands, not a spear?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I see... So someone you want to hurt, but not kill...  
Yes. We shall not commit murder.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Or maybe it's a holy oil death match, where you're not allowed to use weapons...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Hehe... I can't wait...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oink!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Looks like we're close.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can smell something in the wind...  
A pungent, rotten odor. Let's go.  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oink-oink!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I see. So that's it?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A poisonous-looking... puddle?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's a damage zone...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's only about the size of a manhole... but it's causing all the plants in the area to wilt.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's where the stench is coming from, too.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Master, you'll probably be okay, but don't breathe too much in.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
That's poisonous ground.  
The miasma from it could rot a normal person's lungs.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
So this is what the boar piglets told us about, huh?  
But where did it come from?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh... There are enemies nearby.  
Think they're the cause?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
No, the miasma probably just brought them here.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They're all ones we've seen before anyway.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. I don't think any of them could have created this poison.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's the cause, you think?  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't know...  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
For now, we need to get rid of them before we can look into this.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's chase them off, Master!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Martha:**   
I see, so that's why you brought me here.  
You want me to purify this place.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I don't know if it can be done, but let me try.  
First I'll sprinkle a little holy water...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Hmm, how about this.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's amazing! The poisonous puddles are disappearing... The stench in the air is clearing up too!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nice purification!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How much do you charge for your holy water, Martha?  
   
**Martha:**   
I can give you as much as you want, but what's more important is faith.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Without faith, the water is meaningless.  
  
   
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fouu!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Obviously, a withered plant could not be revived. Unfortunate as it is...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
But something else will take root again in this place now, and surely bloom.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
That poisonous ground was meant to molder the island's land. It was fortunate that we could purify it this early.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I feared that, if neglected, the island would have transformed into a land of death that could not grow a single weed in the end.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
At the very least, this island is rich in its natural resources. I cannot see them all gone to waste.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...I can't believe this. Not only are you asking others to take care of the monsters for you, you're even asking the same people to take care of your environment?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I don't know if the ruler has forgotten about this island or just abandoned it, but I just added one more entry to the list of items I want to complain about.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Huh? Where are you going, little one?  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Hoink, oink! ...Oi?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Selfish behavior will only lead to your own demise.  
What are you after? Tell me, look me in the eyes and spit everything out.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Er, pointing your spear is a bit excessive, no?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't be a hero that kills with your eyes!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Ugh! How base of me. I still have the notion that boars are vermin. Well, they actually are, but...  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oi...oi!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fouu. Fou, Foou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh no... Not you too, Fou!  
I'll go after them.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...? Oh, I see.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Judging from Fou's behavior, it doesn't look like the boar piglet was trying to flee.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It seems there's another place the piglet wanted to take us to. In other words, another place plagued by the poison.  
  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!? Fou... (Blech)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh... What's going on here!?  
The miasma has spread wider than the previous place.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The entire area has been completely transformed into a poisonous swamp!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
How terrible! The air in the Palace of Versailles was considerably poisonous, but this is even worse.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
To accumulate this much poison... What!?  
Ya wanna mess with a holy maiden!?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Keep your voice down.  
Be cautious, we are not the only ones here.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah. An eerie dripping sound...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I have another bad feeling about this...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, take a look over there, Master.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can see something rolling in the swamp. Could it be some animal that was affected by the miasma?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
No, that's not it...  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oink!?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
A demon boar! They're still around!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
That must be a mud bath. Something boars do to remove the dirt and parasites from their bodies.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
That place is called a marshy field. Those conditions are said to be the etymology for the expression “writhe in agony” in the Far East.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
S-So knowledgeable!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Tell me more! Ms. Scáthach!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
If the poisonous swamp created the marshy field for that thing... Wait, it's the opposite. It was that rolling around on the ground that created the swamp.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
The puddle we ran into earlier was a mere coincidence.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
This is the real thing. That monster will come back here again and again. I guess you can call this place its favorite bathtub.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Either way, poison is produced from that thing's body right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In that case, the true culprit behind this land of poison, the one the boar piglets wanted to show us was...  
  
   
**Demon Boar:**   
Grr... Grrrph!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It noticed me!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm, a demon boar that releases poison from its body...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I won't say anything if you catch prey or do something else with that.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
However, I cannot overlook how you've ruined and eroded this island, since that is an act that violates our lives here.  
  
   
**Demon Boar:**   
Grr, grrrph!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Demon Boar:**   
Ghhhaa...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It could be problematic if there are more boars like that who can produce miasma and corrupt this island...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Eventually we might have to do this all over again.  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oinkkyy...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
All right then. First let's do something about this impure swamp first. Here's some holy water, then...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
What!? I can't purify it!?  
My prayers haven't been heard, hmm!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Ahem. Sorry you had to see that.  
It seems I didn't pray enough to prove my faith.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I'm sure it's because I was using the coastal rocks as punching bags to train myself...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
And ended up changing the landscape a bit because I was going at it too hard... Please forgive me...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
In other words, you can't make this place beautiful again?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
The previous one was rather small in scale, but this one's corrosion is too severe... I can't get rid of it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If it's impossible for Martha...searching for a different way isn't going to help...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm... Yes, it will be difficult, but it's better than doing nothing. Here, let me help.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I happen to have these ash tree seeds with me. I'll make it so that they grow by absorbing the poison in the ground.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Those seeds will clean up the surface, you say?  
How wonderful!  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oiiink!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
The effects won't be immediate, though.  
As Martha said, the poison is deep.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Plants also take large amounts of time to grow strongly. If you rush things, they will lose to the miasma and quickly wither away.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
They need to carefully absorb each drop of poison, slowly but surely. It'll take a long, long time...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Exactly how long is a “long, long time”?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Well, roughly 1,000 years?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's long!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
But, in that case, the land will eventually be able to return to its original state.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Only the next best strategy can be taken if nothing can be done immediately.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
If we combine her holy water with these seeds, we'll at least be able to prevent the poisonous swamp from expanding any more than now.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Right. It's better than doing nothing, surely.  
We may not be around anymore at that time though.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Since we're guests here, it would be a form of giving back to the island, no? To take back its future, so to speak.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. I think that's a wonderful prospect.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Then, let's get to work. It'll be our first job; one worth commemorating later.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm. It would be safe to say that there are still demon boars around.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Fortunately, however, we still have a few ash tree seeds.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
If we find more poisonous swamps like this, or more other demon boars that produce them,  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
we'll need to deal with them in the future too.  
Try not to miss any, Master...!  
  
   
## Section 6: "Village"  
   
**Marie:**   
Phew, playing with beach balls is fun, but I'm a bit tired. How about we take a break? Don't worry, it looks like we have nothing but time.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I can't believe how elegant I was in securing that victory! I'm... I'm scared of myself! My own elegance is terrifying!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
BUT! Being the beautiful, successful woman I am,  
I mustn't gloat! I must be graceful with my gifts!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
And so instead off I go to relax in the shade of my parasol, brushing my tail and flaunting my sexy body for the whole world to see!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Girls, it's up to you to decide how tropical you want to feel on this island.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
However, just know that your actions directly affect both our Master's present AND future.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Do not forget that. Make sure you pull yourselves together when you're supposed to.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
By the way, Master, I have an important question.  
What is for dinner tonight?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Dammit, how am I supposed to behave?  
To think we'd be in the same space... (glance)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Of course, I meant that person is such an eyesore.  
I totally mean it!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Arrgh, I'm just gonna go clear up my head a little bit. Maybe I'll go ride some waves!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Now, there are still many tasks left for us to do.  
Which one shall we start with... Heh heh...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Hmm? What is with this feeling of excitement?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Perhaps it's the sea, the beach, and the shining sun.  
This is rare indeed...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It appears that everyone is starting to get used to life on this island.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At first, everything was inconvenient and everyone was feeling dissatisfied, but maybe now all the hard work has finally paid off.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
However... something strange has been happening. Would you listen to me, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Please grace us with your wise words!  
   
**Martha:**   
I-I'd rather you not be that formal with me all the time.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
If you ain't joking, then I'll really make you my lackey!  
...Um, ahem, where was I?  
  
   
  
   
**Martha:**   
It seems the men are acting a bit strange.  
See, over there.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Did you see that?  
Those two whispering over there...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The two of them disappear a lot lately... right?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Hmm. Not just those two.  
The other men tend to disappear a lot too.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I noticed that too, but I've been letting it slide.  
After all, they've all done their fair share of work.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
(Emphatically) I didn't notice anything at all!  
I was looking at my Master the whole time!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
In that case... what shall we do, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's tail them.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's ask them what they are doing. Right now.  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Mmm, yeah... They might play stupid and pretend not to know anything... so let's just follow them for the time being.  
  
   
  
   
**Martha:**   
Count me in. If they dare go against the teachings of God, I will punish them... despite the fact that they're also castaways.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
That's right, this is not about us being nosy. We're simply taking a peek into what they're doing. It's a holy and sacred act of confirmation!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You know, that just makes you sound even more nosy...  
  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Mash:**   
They're moving deeper and deeper into the island...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Looks like they're trying not to get noticed. That can only mean... they are trying to do something suspicious...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Let's be cautious. We can follow their trail even if we lose visual. More importantly, we don't want them to find out they're being stalked.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
There must be a reason for them to be this secretive...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I don't want to know what would happen if they found out that we are...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't scare me.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're all allies... RIGHT!?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
You're too naive!  
Even more naive than a baby!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I've been paying attention to see if there are any traps along the way and here you are, being naive.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Listen, Master. Don't you ever underestimate the lengths which men with a guilty conscience will go to.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You are exactly right. Yes, they will run away... lie to you... It truly is... terrible...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(I'm getting chills down my spine!)  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Somehow I've lost sight of them. It's not like we can't track them anymore, but there's one problem...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Even if there are no traps, it looks like there is a gatekeeper... You there! Isn't that right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Come out, whoever you are!  
I know you are there!  
  
   
**???:**  
I see... very impressive.  
Then allow me to show myself...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-This voice is...!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
This voice... It can't be...!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
My name is... Island Mask!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Oh. No. Who. Can. It. Be.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are you doing, Mr. Swallow Reversal?  
   
  
   
**E：???:**  
My name is Island Mask. I have no relationship with that refined swordsman and renowned gatekeeper.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Oh, um, okay. Look.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
You can call yourself whatever you want.  
I don't care.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
But that getup... It's basically a sign that I can punch your face in until your mask breaks, right?  
  
   
**Island Mask:**   
Hahaha. Only you, Lady Martha, would get that kind of impression upon seeing this mask!  
  
   
**Island Mask:**   
Unfortunately, it's something that I borrowed, so I must ask you not to break it. And while I'm at it, I'll add that I'd rather you not punch me with those gauntlets of yours.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I see. Well then I'll aim solely for your stomach. I'll punch it so hard you won't be able to digest anything for three days. Just think of it as fasting.  
  
   
**Island Mask:**   
So it has come to this. I suppose you are a holy maiden who educates others with an iron fist.  
  
   
**Island Mask:**   
Well, be that as it may,  
a gatekeeper must perform his duty.  
  
   
**Island Mask:**   
You may only go through once you have defeated me... That is what I am trying to say.  
  
   
**Island Mask:**   
I am the great forest incarnate. An enigma.  
My existence transcends good and evil, and so forth.  
  
   
**Island Mask:**   
In short, do not hold back on me.  
Come, Lady Martha, come at me!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
So, seeing me in my swimsuit, all out of control, has made him lose control as well?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
What a sinful holy maiden you are!  
You must be kind of be happy to be that sought after?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Huh? Well, um...  
Maybe this bikini is a little too attractive?  
  
   
**Island Mask:**   
Oh no, I do not desire you in any way. What I truly desire is the armored dragon Tarasque, you know?  
  
   
**Island Mask:**   
Now, hurry! Bring that towering and intimidating Tarasque before me... HURRY! (Excited)  
  
   
**Martha:**   
That does it! I won't pull any punches!  
I will face you as if I am facing an angel!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
As you wish! The emptiness of conflict... I will hammer that concept into your bones with this iron fist!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Ugh!  
  
   
**Tarasque:**   
Boss! Why are you getting all salty with me too!?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh, sorry, Tarasque. I sorta lost my cool and kinda went with it. Sorry, tee hee☆  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No. Way. It's. Sasaki. Kojirou. (Deadpan)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Island Mask, defeated!  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
...Hah. Heh heh. Well well, I've lost.  
I've lost to you completely.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Satisfied? Now I'll ask you again...  
What were you trying to do?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
As the victor... I mean, as the one preaching God's words on the emptiness of conflict, I think I have the right to ask.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
I... I...  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
I WANTED TO PLAY, TOO!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Huh!?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Come again?  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
It's summer! We're on a deserted island! As someone who appreciates elegance, of course I wanted to enjoy this occasion!  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
I was thinking it should be okay for me to go wild for a bit... But unlike you, my friends...  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
I was not given the privilege to go wild in a swimsuit!  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Why, you ask? Because I am a mere 1-star Servant.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I feel like I just heard something I shouldn't...  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Therefore I was left with no other choice but to transform and add excitement to the occasion. That was the purpose of the mask... you know? YOU KNOW?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
By the way, where did that mask come from...?  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Heh. You would know nothing about it, my Master... About the zealous union of us common Heroic Spirits! The 1 Star Alliance!  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
This mask was handed to me by Lord Amadeus.  
He told me to use it “if something comes up.”  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Lady Martha's fist shattered it...but it was the symbol of our determination...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see... I'm just glad it wasn't Spartacus's mask...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Fine. I do understand that you wanted to vent your frustration and regret...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
However, let me ask you one more time.  
Why did you get in our way?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
The men that went on ahead weren't common rarity, right? In that case, you didn't have the obligation to help them, now did you?  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Hmm. I asked them to hire me since I thought it'd be a nice chance for Island Mask to play a part...  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
But I think it would be easier for me to show you what I mean rather than tell you.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
A defeated gatekeeper has no choice.  
I will show you the way.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
...We might run into some monsters along the way, but that won't pose any issue for you, now will it, Master?  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Karna:**   
...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Huh? Hey, bodyguard, what are you doing?  
Why the hell would you bring them here?  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
I apologize. I was having too much fun fighting and I lost.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Tch. Well, it was only a matter of time until they found out about this place...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-This is...!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
This place...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There are buildings...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And a crop field...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right, Master. It's on a smaller scale... but it looks just like our village.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Well, the cat's out of the bag now.  
This is a village created just for the men.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
They got buildings and even a crop field. Although the direction they went in is slightly different than ours.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Hmm... Hmmmmm... This place is more organized than I thought. Some structures are even built better than ours...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I do feel like we've lost a game...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But why would you hide this place?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
It has to be hidden.  
You see, boys do like their little secret bases, right?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Although the place you guys got there is getting a lot more convenient than here.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Either way, Diarmuid, Fionn, and I talked about how building a village with our own hands would also serve as good training.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
And so, even with those guys gone, we've decided to continue building this place in secret.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
How should I put it... Fionn said it best...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
It makes us feel nervous when there are girls in swimsuits around all the time.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Uncle Fergus, on the other hand, would've loved that place. He'd do as he pleased, without a care in the world.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see... Does this village have a name?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Hmm? Well, it's...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Both Fionn and Diarmuid entrusted their dying wish to us.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
In order to honor the noble Lancers who built this place, we call it... “Backspear Village.”  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Heh heh. I am just a farmer with a hoe, a support member if you will.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...So a spin on your boy band name.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Hahaha, that's a funny joke you got there.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Still, if even the ever-calm Karna would go wild with the base, we might be able to create some good tunes there.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
I will shred the bassline like a wild beast&ndash;whatever that means&ndash;and tear into my Master's enemies.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
It's just a joke. Well, I'm sure there's a version of me who's in a band somewhere.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
But that's a different me,  
and a different Backspear Boys.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
We are the summer edition of Backspear, and we'll be burning up the charts all summer long!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I feel like Cú Chulainn is just blurting nonsense right now.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All I got is that the men here are really enjoying themselves.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This place is their haven, their paradise.  
Let's leave it alone for now.  
  
   
## Section 7: "Tusk"  
   
**Mash:**   
We've gathered a lot of materials.  
If we keep it up, we'll be able to build a statue soon.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Hmm. I still don't see the point, to be honest...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
However... We already made that decision as a whole.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
We've entered the final phase of preparations for construction of our escape ship.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
A statue is a beacon of hope; it'll keep morale up.  
I think it's important we build one.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Could it be like the figurehead placed in front of ships to pray for safe sailing...?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
That's right. Giving form to our determination will make it easier to rally everyone together.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
But most of all, it gives us something to offer our prayers to.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Hee. Prayers and beliefs? That's where I come in! I'm pretty sure it's obvious what kind of statue we want to build, right?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Well, Master will have the final decision.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
It's too embarrassing to see my own statue, so no thanks.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Although, if Master were to secretly carve a small wooden bust of me and sleep with it every night... Ehehehe, just thinking about it makes me excited.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
That statue would serve the same purpose as a war god statue right? In that case, shouldn't we base it on the most powerful one here? I ain't gonna tell you who, though.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...It'll be quite an undertaking&ndash;one that will really change the island's appearance.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please take your time and choose carefully, Master.  
Now, let's start the preparations&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
That's...!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...I see. The big boss is here.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
An unbelievably huge enemy! It's on its way here!  
  
   
**H：???:**  
GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRF!!!  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
O-Oink...!?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
The boar piglets are panicking!  
I can't blame them, what with all this pressure...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Damn, the big one decided to show up now, huh?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All the other demonic boars must be its young!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who are you!? State your name!  
  
   
**H：???:**  
Grrrhhahahahaha...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's laughing... It can understand us?  
...No, it must be my imagination...  
  
   
**Karna:**   
That towering body... It's just as intimidating as Varaha's, the avatar of Vishnu...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
That thing is evil. You can tell just by looking at it.  
Just an evil creature, nothing more.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
We need to take it down.  
That goes without saying.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
The fact that the existence of such a creature is even allowed is just... Ugh.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
This island must have some sort of protection. Without it, the demonic boars would've sunk it a long time ago.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
The land here provided such wonderful foundations, yet it is now abandoned. I truly want to express my anger to the ruler of this island.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Such evil, allowed to run rampant... Only my homeland could match the extent to which... Hmm?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Hey, you! We're about to start work on our giant Tamamo statue! One that'll live on in the annals of history!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
That massive body of yours will cast a shadow over its construction! You're a giant nuisance!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Well, I quite like it.  
A huge body like that is worth punching!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
In the end, you are just a king that is oppressing these boar piglets, right?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
You're so big and you look so strong, yet the way you treat these little ones... I can't forgive it. Shame on you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There is no choice left but to fight.  
Let's go, Master!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**???:**  
Gaaaaah!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It went into the ocean and fled as fast as it could!?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
It sure is a stubborn creature. As resistant as its hide.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...However, we have hurt it pretty badly.  
It won't meddle with us for a while.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's hurry up and finish that escape ship.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hopefully it will never come back...  
   
**Mash:**   
I agree. We might need to speed up our schedule.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Luckily, it seems like construction is almost complete... Right, Scáthach?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Scáthach?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Hmm? Oh, uh, right.  
Soon. Well, let's go back to work...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...?  
  
   
## Final Section: "Farewell, Beloved Uninhabited Island"  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm. That should do it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We... we finished!  
We finally finished the escape ship, Master!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, Foou!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
It was a pretty long, hard journey.  
I have no other way to describe it.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
I think it's a good ship. Although we really won't know how she handles the sea until we take her out.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Don't worry about who'll take the helm either.  
You can leave that to us.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
This time I am going on a cruise with Master...  
Romance on the high seas... Hee hee hee...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh that reminds me! We have to do that at the bow! What was it...? Right, that Titanic thing!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Come on, let's do that together, dear!  
Oh, you don't have to embarrassed about it!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Wouldn't it be cooler if we stuck some metal plates onto this thing? Some horns...or maybe spikes?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I guess our fun vacation is about to end.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh well, it doesn't matter. I'm sure the image of my beautiful summer self has been seared into my Master's mind.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Once we're back in Chaldea, I will activate my secret move: Tamamo Subliminal Message! Master won't be able to rest again without seeing swimsuits!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Hmm? Hehe, the boar piglets seem to be happy for us.  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oink, oink, oink!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Well. It's almost as if they are all clapping.  
Thank you...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Say, Scáthach?  
Can't these little ones ride with us?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Impossible.  
I didn't design this ship with their numbers in mind.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I've cast runes on the ship's body so it may adapt to all kinds of situations. However, that means it also required very delicate magical adjustments.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
We won't be able to set sail with them onboard.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Is that so... Too bad...  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
...Oink...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
But that big demonic boar is still on this island, right?  
If we leave these little ones here...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They might be attacked.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They might not be able to live safely.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right. That possibility does exist. I would have liked to rid them of that problem, but... well...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmph. Would you look at that. The solution came to us.  
  
   
**???:**  
&mdash;Grrrrrrrrrrrrrfffffffffff!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Back for more?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
But look, the wound we inflicted earlier hasn't healed yet.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
We can do it now. We just might be able to kill it!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Master.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
If we jump aboard right now,we can finally leave this place...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Master.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...But...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Master.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We owe a lot to these boar piglets.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Hah.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's fight! For the peace of this island!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Heh... I expected nothing less from ya!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Well said, Master.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
The Knights of the Round Table are not assembled, my beloved hound Cavall is not here, there's no army under my command...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
But nevertheless, for the briefest of moments, this island was our kingdom... And those little ones behind us were its people.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
How can I call myself a king...  
without fighting for the people!  
  
   
**???:**  
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrfffffffff!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's go, Master!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh... It's so strong!  
  
   
**???:**  
GRRRR, GRRRRRRRRRRFFFF!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
My my, I'm amazed at its stubbornness.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Ugh... I expected it to be strong, but... to think it would have such incredible stamina...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I thought I was used to exterminating monsters...  
Could I be getting weaker?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm. It's quite a tough enemy.  
Its presence here... must mean that, yes, this&mdash;  
  
   
**???:**  
GGGRRRR... GRR?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That glance... What's it looking at?  
...Oh no! The escape ship!  
  
   
**???:**  
GRRRR, GRRRRRRRRRRFFFF!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
It's charging! Damn it, this is bad!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's so fast...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'll never make it!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That charge will destroy the ship on impact!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh no. We won't make it in time&mdash;  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
O...Oiiiinnnk!  
  
   
**???:**  
!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The boar piglets... They're forming a wall!  
  
   
**Mary:**   
...“Formed” a wall, you mean. The demonic boar bowled them all over, but at least now it's changed course!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
The ship's safe!  
  
   
**???:**  
GRRRRRFFFFFFF!  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
O-Oink!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They've made another barricade!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh no... Over and over again...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Look at how many poor piglets have been knocked out cold... Still, thanks to them, at least we made it in time!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're in position now! Leave it to us!  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oi...nk...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
...Even with your combined strength, there was no way you could have defeated such a huge beast...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
You knew that, didn't you?  
...And yet you still protected our ship.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Silly piglets... Had the boat been destroyed, we could have been together a little more.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Mr. Big Boar. Sorry&mdash;  
Most likely, there's no place here for you.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
This is their island.  
  
   
**???:**  
GRRRRFFFF...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Yeah... I know. You're big and they're small.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
You both eat to survive, and then eventually you die. You're both the same animal.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
So why do they get the island, not you?  
You're thinking how unfair it is, right?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
...I know how you feel, but I can tell you exactly why.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
...Because they're weak, they're short-lived.  
And because they surely can't oppose your strength.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
We are strong and have the power to protect them, so that is what we will do. Our purpose is to protect the weak.  
  
   
**???:**  
...!?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Yes. In a word, I suppose that's just my selfishness.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
The weak die out, and those with power control the land.  
It's like that everywhere.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
...But you know what?  
I'm Marie Antoinette.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I'm known as the most selfish girl in the world!  
  
   
**???:**  
GR...GRRR... GRRRFFFF!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is the end, Master.  
Let's finish him off!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**???:**  
Gugh... Oooooo!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
W-We did it! It stopped moving and it's sinking to the bottom of the ocean!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Counterattack successful!  
Nice work, Master.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm. I guess even a big boar like that isn't enough to kill me. Not like death by boar is a common occurrence, anyway...  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
...O-Oink...oink.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
...Ah. Yes, that's right. Everything will be fine now.  
That big bully's gone.  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oink, oink.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fouu.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh no. Fou's got that “Don't replace me!” look in his eyes again...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-It's okay, Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm looking at you in celebration of our victory, just like always!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou? Foufou.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
At first I was thinking to myself, “How inconvenient. What kind of island is this?”  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Now it actually feels nostalgic.  
Who knew I'd be this emotional...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're right...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I've grown quite attached to this island.  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Yes, it's amazing.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I guess that's because we all put in the effort to make this place easy for us to live in.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Marie, it's time to say goodbye.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Yes, I understand.  
It is quite regrettable but...  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oink...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh, don't cry like that.  
Please live a happy life here.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
From your perspective, we may have very well ruined this island with all the things we built...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
However, please feel free to enjoy the food and all that in the field. If you feel like it, you can even do something new with all of it.  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
Oink...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
...Goodbye.  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
...Oiiinnnk! Oii!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Farewell! It was fun!  
  
   
**Boar Piglet:**   
...Oi...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's kind of sad with them not around, huh?  
   
**Marie:**   
Is that so? I'm... I'm fine...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Here's hoping they have a happy life.  
   
**Marie:**   
Yes. I pray that island becomes a tropical paradise for those little ones.  
  
   
  
   
**Marie:**   
However, it seems we still have a problem. The ship has been rocking really hard. Is it really going to be okay?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
It was the best ship I could build with the alloted time. It is properly protected by runes as well. No need to worry.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
...Perhaps you were questioning our skills at the wheel? Just so you know, the ship's running fine.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
We haven't really decided what course it will take, though.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
No worries. I am sure we will reach somewhere if we just sail straight ahead.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You just say whatever you want, don't you? Is that compass even working? Lying is not good, you know?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
At any rate, we have plenty of food stored up. Since nothing is more important than food, I made sure of that personally.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I don't mind where we end up.  
Just as long as it allows us to contact Chaldea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're right. Let me try right now.  
It wouldn't surprise me if we could already.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
So you're saying you don't even know when we'll be able to get in touch with them again? Man, now this is gonna be a long voyage...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Well, we've had our relaxing island vacation, so why not an elegant ocean vacation next?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
You people are still gonna be in swimsuits, yeah?  
We know how to take a hint...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
It means we men are still supporting roles.  
We'll be good and sit on the sidelines.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
I already had enough fun on that island in my own way.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Perhaps I will quietly stay in my cabin and play hanafuda.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
The Japanese card game? Hm, for some reason I remember playing it. Yeah, that'll help us kill some time.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
So there you have it. You probably won't see us again until we're back in Chaldea. Don't worry, we'll behave.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hehe... Maybe Tamamo has the right attitude.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If there's no way of knowing when we'll reach land, why even worry about it at all?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As long as we just relax and enjoy ourselves on this ship, like we did on the island, then we may not have a problem.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, is there anything you want to do out in the open waters?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fish, I guess.  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, we did a lot of fishing back on the island... But you're right. Saltwater fishing would be a different experience entirely.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I wonder what kind of fish we'll catch...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I guess... we can pretend we're pirates.  
   
**Mary:**   
What? Don't tell me, Master...  
You always wanted to be a pirate?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Why didn't you tell me earlier!? Very good, very good!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Hehe, I will teach you everything about being a pirate personally! Very personal, day and night!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hey you two, at least one of you,  
focus on steering the ship!  
  
   
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fouu.  
  
   
## Brilliant Summer - Going Out With Tamamo -  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Lalala! Mikko miko mikonkon♪  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Tamamo got all excited all of a sudden and brought us here, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I have no idea where we're going...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hey, foxy girl!  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
My, what a warm, sunny way to address someone!  
Just like this weather! ...What is it, Master?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can I ask you a question, Tamamo?  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Yes, anything! From my BWH measurements, to what gifts I want the most at this moment...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I'll give you all the latest Tamamo news, if that's what you want! Ask away!  
  
   
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...Our destination? Oh, nowhere fancy...  
I think about here will do, even...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
All right. Take out the parasol, spread the sheet over there, get the basket out...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Okay, that should do it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This... This setup is...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fouuuu♪  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This is a picnic...right?  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Why yes, it is something like that.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Come to think of it, I'm hungry.  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
That's perfect! Now don't be shy. Come! Come!  
  
   
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
It's not every day you get to have a picnic, so I kind of went all out in the kitchen... Dig in!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wow... There are so many dishes here you normally wouldn't see back at the base!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You are good at this!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Looks delicious!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Hehehe, I figured you already know this but I've been training night and day to become a good wife!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I've been taking cooking lessons as well, so hopefully I've properly displayed those skills.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
You see, my cooking teacher Uzume-chan and I have been friends since the events of the Kojiki, one of Japan's oldest legends.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
She thus possesses the necessary culinary knowledge to survive in the wild like this. And so, figuring a day like this would come...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...I asked her to teach me how to be self-sufficient and cook dishes that would win my dear Master's heart!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
When it comes to what can be eaten or not, Scáthach might know a thing or two, HOWEVER...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I am confident that I am better at turning those ingredients into a delicious dish.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Now come try these acorn cookies.  
There's bread made from acorn flour too.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can you eat acorns?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Not normally, no. Their high toxicity produces a bitter, astringent sensation.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
There ARE some kinds you can eat directly, though.  
As for the others... well, you can get by as long as you get rid of the astringency.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I see... This is really educational.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
This here is tochi mochi, made with Japanese horse chestnut. Of course, it too needs to have its harsh taste removed.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh, and this is some tea made from a unique blend of medicinal herbs I gathered myself. It's delicious and healthy.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is amazing... I think I've gained a newfound respect for you, Tamamo.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's never been this into cooking before...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Me too. I wonder what happened?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I was actually going to go for a “well-to-do fox at the beach” vibe at first, since we're on a tropical island and all...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
However, you'll just ignore me if I all I do is relax elegantly under a parasol. Nothing would change.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Even if that actually is the case, I thought you'd forget about me if we don't have some sort of physical contact from time to time...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Well, at least that was the idea.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Besides, come to think of it, I never got the opportunity to explain my current style. That was also one of the reasons.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're Lancer now, right?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're Tamamo Summer Version, right?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Well, yes.  
But there's something more important than that.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Since we're on a summer vacation, I'm rerouting all my magical energy to my body, strengthening it. I'm a veritable beast of summer.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
This time I wouldn't be a close-minded and unattractive spellcaster, I thought. No, I'd be an elegant socialite instead...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hmm... I don't really understand how those things connect... but I understand why you've been fighting at close quarters now...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
So anyway, since I am a summer beast, I thought I should let that wild side out from time to time.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
And as an added bonus, I decided to offer Master a picnic and some recreation like this. That's why I guided you here, you know?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Recreation?  
All of a sudden I have a bad feeling about this.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Now that our tummies are full, let's head over there.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Sorry, but if we get any closer, this foul stench will totally ruin my appetite...  
  
   
**Demon Boar:**   
Grrrrr...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A demon boar! ...And this is its poisonous swamp!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Obviously, my nose can pick up smell better than before.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
So I just happened to find this monster earlier than the boar piglets.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Now, Master. This is the end of our picnic.  
That's a worthy opponent!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Let's release our pent-up wildness!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nothing is pent-up for me, you know!?  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Good good, I'm feeling much better!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Now I can focus on showing off my glamorous body like an elegant socialite should... all while hiding my monstrous side.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I'm a beachside beauty... Definitely not desperate...  
Yes, I can see it now! By the end of summer, you who failed to notice me...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...will realize for the first time that you've actually been in love with me all along! Tee hee! I love it♪  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...Ahem.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Ah, yes, where were we? We were going to see what could be done about Martha's prayer and Scáthach's seeds, right?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Yes. Then let me go get them.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Summer Tamamo... It really is hard to tell what her wild side is going to do next, isn't it!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's because it's summer...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
## Brilliant Summer - Together With Mordred -  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Great. Right here should be fine.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, Senpai, what is Mordred going to do to us at this quiet, secluded river?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's probably going to do us in...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Our corpses will float downriverand it'll be the perfect crime...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
D-Don't be stupid! I wouldn't do that!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Anyway. I guess I did leave you in the dark. Here you go, Master. I threw this together yesterday. Go ahead and use it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A wooden surfboard?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How do I use this weapon?  
   
**Mordred:**   
What? Was that a joke? It wasn't even funny...  
No, dummy, it's a surfboard. A surfboard!  
  
   
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I saw the jealous look you had when I was surfing, so here you are!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Jealous look?)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
And I'll teach you how to surf as well.  
It's your first time, right?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I've taken up river surfing lately.  
Just for a change of pace.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I thought this would be better for beginners, so I brought you guys along.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, yeah. I have a board for you too, Mash. Here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, uh, thank you.  
So, you mean I'm going to surf too?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I sure do! And if you think I'm going to lend you my Prydwen, you're mistaken!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Or did you intend to surf on your shield?  
It's probably not impossible, but still...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh. That'd actually be pretty blasphemous. I like it.  
You really know how to rock.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I would never do that!  
Fine, I'll use this...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Good! All right, time for your lesson!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The waves...I'll become one with the waves...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, hey! You've gotten the hang of it, Master!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
If I ever form a suicide surfer squad, I'll let you be my right-hand man.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Of course, I'll be the leader.  
And, naturally, we'll be attacking King Arthur.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I can already imagine... The king's forces in perfect formation...with our suicide surfers suddenly emerging from the sea behind them... Hah! We'll win for sure.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Gub, blub, glub, glub, glub)  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai! Senpai!  
Hurry up and grab onto this!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh man, this is gonna take a while...  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Whew... Once you try it, it's actually a lot of fun...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
You learn pretty fast.  
But I won't let you best me!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You sure are good...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's magnificent...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You sure do like surfing, don't you, Mordred?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I get how enjoyable it can be now...  
But is that the only reason you surf?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Well, no. I mean, I am who I am, after all.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...You're not that bright, are you?  
Don't you see what I'm riding? Waves.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Going against the flow of a giant wave, not with it... Pretty treacherous, eh? The other definition.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
It matches my character, right? I always have to go against something. If there's no treachery, I can't go on...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mordred...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Ah, no, it's just like you said. It's just lots of fun!  
It's the same as riding a wild horse.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
For a knight, whether it be horse, wave, or woman... The harder they are to handle, the greater the valor in taming them!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm not so sure about the last one...?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Is it about time to switch? Next is...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Wait! Don't go in the river! I'm coming out!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This smell... Something is happening upstream.  
The water is getting muddy, there's dead fish floating around...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Let's move upstream.  
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
It's those guys, probably.  
Those boars must be playing in the mud...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're right. And the resulting poisonous swamp appears to have contaminated the river, on account of its proximity...  
  
   
**Demon Boar:**   
Grrrr...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
In other words... Thanks to you guys, my splendid river surfing spot has been ruined. I'll kill you!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Poison swamp? Bring it on! It's only deadly if I fall in. Did you think I'd be frightened by a wave that size!?  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
Aww, damn. Not in the mood anymore. Let's go home, Master. We'll leave the rest to Scáthach and the others.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, uh, Mordred...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
What is it?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you for today. I had a good time.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...I-I didn't come here to show you guys a good time,  
you know.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I didn't like being watched,  
so I just educated you, that's all!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
And now that I have, you'd better remember what you learned for next time. If you don't... I'll kick your ass!  
  
   
## Brilliant Summer - A Date With Kiyohime -	  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Now we finally have the chance to take a walk together alone. Let's have a good, long talk, okay?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
We'll talk about our plans for the future, and the place where we'll create our first memories, and...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, that's right! Why are you a Lancer?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...I see. Our future together is very important, so you'd rather we talk about that later? You sure know how to leave a girl hanging, Master.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes, I'm overjoyed to know that you're interested in me for who I am.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
During my era, the naginata was a new weapon. But, fortunately, my home was well-off, so I learned to use it for self-protection.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Also, I'm not dressed in my usual garments.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I thought that if I carried something different than normal, I could get your heart to race, Master.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
A swimsuit is graceful, and nothing says “graceful” more than a naginata. So, Master, your heart IS racing, isn't it?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yep. (Because of the reach she has with that thing.)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yes. (Because of how deadly that thing seems.)  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You know...what I hate, don't you?  
So are you telling the truth?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course. (Having her behind me makes my heart race.)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yes. (Catching her in my periphery makes my heart race.)  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hehehe. Being here with you, wearing a different outfit... It makes me so happy.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Makes my heart...beat fast...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, look, a river. The current in the middle is fast, but here it's calm and beautiful.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Since we have swimsuits on, why don't we both go for a dip, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you good at swimming?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I never used to be. But, since our fateful meeting, I've been&mdash;Huh?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Master.  
Do you see that on the other side of the river?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A demon boar!  
  
   
**Demon Boar:**   
Grrrr... Growf...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
It doesn't appear to have noticed us yet.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
It looks... like it's on its way back to its den.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
We've had to clean up several poisonous swamps already. Could this be another one?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
For the sake of the island's wildlife, we can't ignore it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
For the sake of the boar piglets, we can't ignore it.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You are so considerate, Master... You are exactly right.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
But what should we do? It might disappear somewhere if we don't keep our eyes on it.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
If we lose sight of it, we have no guarantee that the boar piglets will find it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
At any rate, let's follow it,  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
But...that means we have to cross this river.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
If we jump over, the boar will notice us.  
We must swim across it stealthily.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
The current becomes much faster in the middle.  
You're in danger of being washed away, Master...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can you give me a hand?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'd like you to assist me.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh... Ooh! Of course! Of course!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
When we looked at each other just now, I understood. That confirmed it.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You have faith in me!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Our hearts are bound together. There is nothing to fear with trust and love like ours.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Now... Hold my hand, Master, and don't ever let go.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I mean, naturally, I have no intention of letting go of you either...for all eternity... Hehehe. Just kidding.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
All right, let us begin...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The current is so swift! But...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're so strong...!?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Are you all right?  
How was my swimming?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The way your body writhed...was like a snake.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The way your body writhed...was like a mermaid.  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my. Me, as beautiful as a mermaid?  
You're too generous...  
  
   
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
As I was saying earlier, I never used to be able to swim.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
But when I was fervently chasing after Anchin, I suddenly found myself slithering across the Hidaka River...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Somehow I was able to swim!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
N-Never mind that! Watch out for the demon boar!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, that's right. Let's go after it before we lose it.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
We found it. Just as we suspected, it's relaxing in a poisonous swamp.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...We did it, Master. That demon boar doesn't look like it will be moving for a while.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Let's remember this location and hurry back to camp. If we grab everyone quickly, I think we can make it back in time.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Then... you'll have front-row seats to observe me as I gracefully put my naginata to use.  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
The demonic boar has been defeated. Let the others handle any leftover business. All right, Master. Shall we have a swim together?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I... I think I'm too tired for a swim right now...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, really?  
But there's no need to worry, Master.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You see... In the end, while thinking of Anchin, I went to the bottom of the river.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
It was cold... and quiet...  
The water seemed to engulf my burning feelings for him.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
It was me, and Anchin within my heart...  
Just the two of us... at the bottom of the river.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...But what if it had been the real Anchin there with me?  
I have often wished it were so.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Therefore, Master, being alone with you at the bottom of the river might not be so bad either.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
If you ever tire of your life... feel free to let me know, all right?  
  
   
## Brilliant Summer - An Expedition With Anne and Mary -  
   
**Fou:**   
Fouu!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This...is a big one!  
  
   
**Mary:**   
...!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Wow! What's this? ...Oh! Oh! What do I do?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Mnnnf?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-It's finally stopped. That was a really huge tremor. We've never had one like it before...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you all right, Anne?  
   
**Anne:**   
...I-I'm perfectly fine!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you all right, Mary?  
   
**Mary:**   
...No problem. I'm perfectly fine. Absolutely all right.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
...But, Mary, you had your cutlass stabbed into that tree. You were holding on for dear life.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And Anne, you had Fou's face squeezed so close to your chest that he almost suffocated...  
  
   
**Mary:**   
I-I thought we were going to capsize. So I just...  
  
   
**Anne:**   
I'm very used to the pitch and roll of a ship. But pitching and rolling while on land? That's just unfair...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, I see... You're great pirates who have spent most of your lives at sea, so you're not used to the ground shaking like this...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh! Another one! A big aftershock!  
  
   
**Mary:**   
All hands! Grab onto something!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
... (Aha! That's it!)  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Eek! Earthquakes frighten me, Master! Eek!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mnnnf!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can't...breathe...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This time she's not stuffing Fou's face into her chest, but Master's...  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Oh, dear! I'm sorry, Master. I'm so frightened by earthquakes, I don't know what to do...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You seemed to be scheming something just now...  
  
   
**Anne:**   
What are you talking about? Hehehe.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Mary? What are you doing, throwing yourself on the ground and grabbing Fou's legs like that?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
...What, me? I was only trying to keep him from running away in a panic...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You may be fine, Mary, but Anne is so afraid of earthquakes, I'm beginning to wonder if she's going to be all right&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At any rate, that tremor just now was quite large.  
Let's go see if there's been any damage or anything.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
What? The earth split open in that last earthquake?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, right here. There's a large diagonal crack.  
And&mdash;  
  
   
**Anne:**   
It continues way down deep into the earth.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
It looks like it connects to a cavity&ndash;a cave of some sort.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A new cave? How exciting...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's start exploring!  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Yes. A cave means treasure.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
I don't plan on letting this chance escape us!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, are you going in right this instant?  
Don't you think we should prepare a little&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They've already gone inside!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Leave it to pirates to make quick decisions... Oh well.  
We may as well join them, Master.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Yes, I have a good feeling about this. The longer the cave, the better. The chances of finding treasure are increasing.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fouuu?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's basically only one way to go, so there's no worry of getting lost. The problem is&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh! It appears there are still some light earthquakes.  
I don't think the cave will collapse, but&mdash;  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Eek! I'm scared! (Squeeeeeze!)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mnngff...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you serious?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Now that she's had a taste of it... Anne has found a legitimate way to hug Master's head...  
  
   
**Mary:**   
You're unusually aggressive, Anne...  
  
   
**Mary:**   
I think I'll get up close too. But unlike Anne, I'll try to latch on when Master begins to stagger...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We've gone pretty deep.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
The frequency of the earthquakes has really increased.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Yes, yes.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(It's like it's too much trouble for them to let go... They've been clinging to Master this whole time.  
What's with these two?)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou!  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Look, Master! There's a wide open area ahead!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Have we finally reached the finish line? Tee hee hee!  
I wonder what the treasure is&mdash;  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Welcome! (Rage)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Blackbeard!?  
I thought you were eliminated!  
  
   
**Mary:**   
That's not the real thing.  
That's a clingy, avaricious ghost!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
What's wrong with you? ...Are you stupid?  
Do you want to die! You're stupid and gonna die!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This must mean... These earthquakes, could they be because of Blackbeard?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
What a joke! This is driving me nuts! Gahrrr!  
Imma go loco on your kokoro!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's time to handle this...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's get rid of him right away...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
No, no, nooooo! I had nothing to do with those tremors! ...At least not directly! Indirectly, well... Maybe yes!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I am so incredibly bitter... Or, should I say, envious...!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
All I wanted to do on this deserted island... was have some huggy-huggy, kissy-kissy, squeezy-squeezy...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I knew it was...something like that...  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Well, he was like that in his final moments too Those are the only regrets this guy has...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Yes, that's all! Especially since you entered this cave!  
I saw you, you know! I saw you!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
What's with this classic “lucky pervert” stuff? Just a little swaying back and forth, and you're all squishy-squishy?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Oh, uh, I meant the earth was swaying, not your...! No, don't get me wrong! And besides, only one of you would sway anyway, right?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Kill. Him. Now.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
But she doesn't understand that I love her for that!  
How sad I am. How truly sad I am...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
So I have no choice but to kill you!  
I know you'll forgive a grudge.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I will huggy-huggy, kissy-kissy, squeezy-squeezy here with you for all eternity!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...And now that I think about it, that one-touch-only agreement we had is still unfulfilled.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Gyuh huh huh huh huh... Mary, be prepared!  
Wash your armpits and bellybutton and wait for me!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Ah. That's not right. No, that's not right, Blackbeard. Dear me, has becoming a ghost made me senile?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I take back my last statement.  
You don't need to wash at all.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
I can't stand this guy any longer!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We have no choice: for the peace of this island, we must destroy this grudge!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
How...unfortunate...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
But as long as you don't reform your HHKKSS desert island life, Blackbeard will be back a second and a third time...  
  
   
**Mary:**   
I couldn't stand to see you again! (Stab)  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Yaaay.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Elimination confirmed.  
It seems the earthquakes have stopped as well.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
That Blackbeard... Why would he smile at the very end? Yech. That is so creepy.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
...Well, if I loved Master or Mary so much that a jealous grudge kept me lingering on in this world after death...  
  
   
**Anne:**   
...then a final killing blow from either of you...  
  
   
**Anne:**   
...might very well make me smile too, you know!  
  
   
**Mary:**   
...Quit saying such crazy things.  
And I mean that in more ways than one.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Hehe, I'm sorry.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
...Well then. Shall we go home?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Yes. We didn't find any treasure, but it was still an enjoyable little expedition with Master.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
That's reward enough for us!  
  
   
## Project 1: Let's Build a Cabin  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, it looks like we'll be living on this island for a while.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So, what should we do first?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's see...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No idea. Any suggestions?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Now, now. There's no rush, Master.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Once you accept the situation, you'll feel much more at ease. Just relax, we're on a tropical&ndash;  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Kyaa!?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, it's a strong squall! It's so strong it hurts!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is there anywhere we can take cover?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, there's a small cave in this cliff.  
Let's go in there for now!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Yikes, I'm drenched! A drenched fox! Well, with this wet T-shirt, at least now I can get all the Master's attention to myself...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Ouch... Is my skin turning red?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I wonder if it ever rained this hard in France...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Hmm... So rain is cold even in the tropics...  
I learned something new.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Kiyohime, can I ask you for some fire?  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh Master. You have finally made up your mind,  
haven't you?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Of course. Please leave it to me.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Now, entrust your body, your soul, everything to me.  
Let me hug you and warm you to the very marrow&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
K-Kiyohime! I believe Master is saying to light a bonfire!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh... Is that so...?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Tamamo, can we ask you for some fire?  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
You want me to use my fire spell, Fiery Heaven?  
We can indeed use a fire of some sort...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I would like to help out, but I'm in a complicated situation at the moment.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
It's a bit difficult to do right away. It is likely related to the fact that I am forced to be a Lancer.  
  
   
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, do you guys hear something?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yep. From the back of the cave...something...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, like the sound of rustling leaves.  
What could it be?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Oh, the sound is getting closer! Please be careful!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Something's coming from the back of the cave!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Look at that dark, creeping shadow spreading out across the ground... It's like a carpet... Is that... Are those...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Bugs.  
  
   
**Marie & Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Kyaaaaaaaaaaa!!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Eeeeee... There's no way we can use that cave now. Absolutely no way.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did someone fire their Noble Phantasm in there?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well, it's already collapsed anyway...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I do remember a great destructive force being unleashed behind me while we were running.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
For the sake of that person, I won't say who did it.  
I'm sure everyone had the same idea.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
By the way, it has stopped raining. At least we're fortunate in that regard. Perhaps it's the will of God.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
However, such unstable weather conditions mean that another squall can happen anytime.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Never mind us. Master may have to continue facing drastic temperature changes.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Hm. Which means&ndash;  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Mikon! I've got an idea, Master! No matter what our situation, I think we need to create a home base!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I agree. I think it is necessary to find a place to rest. Luckily, it looks like we can easily obtain wood.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Yup yup, Kiyohime gets it!  
The smell of wood is really comforting, you know?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I don't mind how small it is, Master.  
They say home is where the heart is.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Rather, we may be forced to keep our bodies close...perhaps our shoulders may accidentally touch...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my. If that is the case, should I be thinking of baby names...?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
How far ahead are you thinking...?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Please wait. I'm afraid to bring this up, but...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
You speak of a simple wooden dwelling...  
Isn't that just going to be like a stable?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Hmph! What are you trying to say, huh? That wooden houses are for animals? Yeah, yeah, I'm a fox, she's a snake... So what!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
No, um, I did not mean to say anything rude.  
I apologize.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I just wanted to point out that this is going to be Master's first base.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Considering this is going to be the new frontier for the pioneering of this island, a house made of wood seems to be a little austere.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I believe we should first use stones to build sturdy living quarters.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
The stability of a stone-made base is incomparable.  
Its defensive powers are also very strong.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Dammit, even if it's a coincidence, our opinions matched! Yep, defense is important!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey...what about iron?  
Why don't we use iron to build it?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
It's strong, and we'll be safe from any enemy.  
Good idea, right? (Glance)  
  
   
**Altria:**   
So in conclusion, Master, I recommend a stone base.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
(...Dammit, Father is pretending not to hear me!)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Everyone, you all have your opinions. But I think we should ultimately leave it up to Master's discretion.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Of course I won't have any objections, so please make a swift decision, Master!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
  
## Project 1 Plan A: Let's Build a Wooden Cabin  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Mikon! Thank you, Master!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Mmmm, that new house smell! (Breathes deeply)  
Oooh, that's good wood.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Just closing my eyes brings back memories of the forest...and red torii gates.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
It makes my tail twitch with excitement!  
Oh, there's nothing sexual in that statement, okay?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my...to make something like that for someone like me...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
This must be...love.  
A love nest!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hehee...heeheehee... I know I am being repetitive, but please allow me to say it once more.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I adore you, Master.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Now let us begin! Everything...from this love nest.  
  
   
## Project 1 Plan B: Let's Build a Stone Cabin  
   
**Altria:**   
Oh... Magnificent.  
It's just how a dwelling should be.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
However, this is just the first step.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
A competent Master like you could easily develop the surroundings even further.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Someday you may even build a grandiose castle rivaling my own Camelot.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It was an amazing castle, wasn't it?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
It was. But to tell you the truth,  
I did not build it from scratch.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
When the tyrant Vortigern was overthrown during my father's lifetime, his fortress was...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Let us not speak of the past.  
It's not appropriate for this place and time.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Because, Master, what we should be talking about here is only the future.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
This little cabin marks our first step towards our new life on this island.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I take back my comparison to Camelot.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
This is not Britain, and you are not Arthur Pendragon.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Even if a castle gets built here, it will be one you envisioned&ndash;a castle of your dreams, as it should be.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
But rest assured, I guarantee it will be a proud and noble place, Master.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
After all, you yourself are a proud and noble person, Master.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I merely await with eagerness the day I see your white castle.  
  
   
## Project 1 Plan C: Let's Build an Iron Cabin  
   
**Mordred:**   
Whoa! I can't believe you built it the way I wanted it! Thanks, Master!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
This is some amazing armor.  
It's really thick and tough!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Want to go in?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Bahahaha! What the heck!?  
It's freakin' hot!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It is an iron house. So the heat of the sun...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is it habitable...?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
What do you mean “habitable”?  
All I care about is defense.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I'm happy as long as it's solid.  
It is ridiculously hot inside though.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
All right, it's too hot, so I'm going to take another dip in the water!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Master, make sure you use the house you created!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
No matter how many fire arrows come your way, you'll be safe as long as you're inside. I guarantee it.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Then again, if you're inside too long, you might get baked before you even see one! Haha!  
  
   
## Project 2: Let's Build a Water Supply  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, did you know?  
The amount of water a human needs each day is 3 liters.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Actually, since we are in this blazing tropical heat, you should drink more.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're well-informed, Mash.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think you're being overly serious...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hydration is important. It's a life-threatening matter, so please be more aware of it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We've been collecting rainwater and drawing water from different places. However, I'm starting to think it's all a bit inefficient, so...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I've discussed the matter with Scáthach.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Mm, she has indeed. For now, we've decided to create a watering place somewhere.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
It'll be a place to preserve fresh water.  
My runes will help in the process too.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
What we need Master to decide is its shape.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
A watering place...the obvious shape would be a well.  
It should be easy to make it with wood.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
A well is fine, but wouldn't the wood rot? I think it would be more durable if it were built with bricks.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
And it would look nice too.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Water is important. I agree with Mash.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Of course. Water is your lifeline out at sea.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Once it runs out, all you can do is pray.  
Either wait till you die or it rains.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-You sound like you know what you're talking about...  
  
   
**Mary:**   
So here's my suggestion. A watering place needs to be practical. It needs to be in the most practical shape. Which means...  
  
   
**Anne:**   
A faucet would be good☆  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
I've been impressed by it ever since I've been at Chaldea.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
If you turn on the faucet, water flows out.  
It's such an amazing system.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Goodness. If a faucet had been installed on our ship,  
  
   
**Anne:**   
maybe those ugly mutinies and water disputes would have never occurred...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(I don't think that was the root of the problem...)  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
A charming wooden well, right Master?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
We will be using it for a long time, so wouldn't a brick well be the most versatile choice?  
  
   
**Anne:**   
By the way, I heard a rumor...  
  
   
**Anne:**   
...that there's a faucet somewhere that pours out orange juice.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
I've even heard there's one that pours udon broth from&ndash;  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Wait. What did you just say?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Well, if we had the supplies, none of the choices would be impossible. It's your decision, Master...  
  
  
## Project 2 Plan A: Let's Build a Wooden Well  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
... (Peering into the well's depths)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Did she just sigh?)  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, Master...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is it not to your liking?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, no, it's not that at all!  
I am deeply moved by this wonderful well!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
In fact, I am so happy surrounded by Master's love and kindness, I feel like I am going to explode...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I was simply reflecting on my emotions.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Master. Have you heard of a gentleman by the name of Ono-no-Takamura?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think I've heard of him...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Ah, oh no! What have I done? To have uttered the name of another gentleman in your presence!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Please do not misunderstand.  
I am neither unfaithful nor frivolous.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I swear upon my own life that I consider his existence less important to me than an ant and I merely referenced his name for the purpose of knowledge, and&ndash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh, who is he, exactly?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Ahem. Oh, yes. He was a court noble famous for his poetry and writing.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Legend has it that he descended into the realm of the dead every day and night via a well to help Lord Enma with his duties.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
My own father used to warn me, “Don't shout into a well. The dead will drag you down!”  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Perhaps wells really are linked to the netherworld.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's scary.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Actually, I find it comforting.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
After all, even if I expire and am forced to return to the Throne of Heroes,  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I can still use this well to come back to you, Master.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You know what, I'll definitely come back.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You've poured so much love for me into this well.  
I don't think there is a more suitable place.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
So remember, Master.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
No matter what happens, you mustn't destroy this well.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
If it does get destroyed, I shall come back to haunt you☆  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(She intends to come back no matter what...)  
  
   
## Project 2 Plan B: Let's Build a Brick Well  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh, this is just bitchin'! What a fabulous well!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Umm...why do you sound like that?  
   
**Martha:**   
O-Oh. What are you talking about?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Pretend not to hear)  
   
**Martha:**   
...Oh, this isn't good.  
  
   
  
   
**Martha:**   
Perhaps it's because I'm in a swimsuit I'm not used to.  
I feel like “it” comes out whenever I let my guard down.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Anyway, this well may seem odd to a modern person like you, but...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Wells were an important source of water during my time too. So I feel quite nostalgic.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why don't we call it “Martha's Well”?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Hehe. I haven't done anything. Since you dug it, shouldn't it be “Fujimaru's Well”?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
If you really want to name it something else, maybe take a famous name...like “Jacob's Well” or something...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
If I were that Samaritan woman,  
would I have given Him water...?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Martha?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh, it's nothing. I was just reminiscing about days gone by and my mind wandered.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
How strange that a well on a desert island would conjure images of the past.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Perhaps because my past had nothing,  
just like this island.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Then again, it was 2,000 years ago. Of course there was nothing. No civilization, no machinery...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Yes...it brings back memories.  
I had nothing, but I was happy.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Happy?  
   
**Martha:**   
Yes, happy. Since I had nothing to begin with,  
I appreciated what was granted to me.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wasn't it inconvenient?  
   
**Martha:**   
There were some inconveniences, but I was happy.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
And with nothing, I could realize the importance of the things that were granted to me.  
  
   
  
   
**Martha:**   
&ndash;God's love and faith.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I am like this now because I lived through that time.  
That is what I was reflecting on.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Since we are here, I shall draw up some water and have Master drink the commemorative first sip!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm not that thirsty...  
   
**Martha:**   
Don't say that, Master. Don't you remember what Mash said? You need to drink plenty because we're in the tropics.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I want to drink Martha's holy water!  
   
**Martha:**   
Just because I give you water, it doesn't mean it's holy!  
  
   
  
   
**Martha:**   
Here you go. Master, drink this and let's work hard for our next task!  
  
   
## Project 2 Plan C: Let's Build a Faucet  
   
**Mary:**   
A feast!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Yes, a feast!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They are so happy... Senpai, it was worth building it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm glad they're happy.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is it something to be so giddy about?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Master, you may not think a faucet dispensing water is anything special...  
  
   
**Anne:**   
But for those of us that experienced water shortages, this is nothing short of a miracle.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Hope that human beings won't have to worry about water anymore.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Even before the world was incinerated, there were regions that still suffered from water shortages.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Though I feel that the existence of faucets isn't really relevant to water shortages on a ship...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I suppose this is a symbol of the ability of modern civilization to manage water.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Now that I think about it, it is amazing how water comes out just like that.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Hold it right there!  
I want to confirm something you mentioned earlier!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...That faucets not only dispense water, but even orange juice and&ndash;  
  
   
**Altria:**   
UDON DASHI!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Uh-oh, Altria is shouting in excitement! I do not understand why, although I do suppose Japanese dashi broth can be dispensed from a faucet.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I am familiar with the splendor of udon.  
It has a simple but deep flavor.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Soft, chewy noodles in a painstakingly prepared soup...it's the epitome of exquisite yet simple-looking cuisine!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Cold udon's tasty too  
   
**Altria:**   
Oh, the dish where the noodles aren't submerged in the soup? Yes, that's also tasty... Truly tasty. The sensation you get when they pass through your throat is accentuated in it.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Fried udon's tasty too.  
   
**Altria:**   
The one where the noodles are pan-fried? Yes, that's also tasty... Truly tasty. The aroma is to die for!  
  
   
  
   
**Altria:**   
...Never mind the noodles! We are talking about this broth coming out of the faucet!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Now let me check!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You can't do that unless you go to UDON country...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What...! Master, you tricked me!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
The king can be so demanding. Just turning on a faucet yields fresh water. Isn't that enough?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Indeed. Just turn the faucet on and watch it flow.  
(Gulp gulp)  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Hmm, delicious! This has motivated me to gather more fresh water!  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Thanks, Master!  
  
   
## Project 3: Let's Build a Kitchen  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, Senpai.  
So far, we've managed to obtain our food on-site.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
However, we are getting sick of simply barbecuing the food.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A few of the crew are suggesting we build a proper cooking facility.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good point.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah, I'm getting sick of barbecue too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Also, I've found a small quantity of grains deep within our supplies.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If we have a proper cooking facility, we may be able to make something else.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So, determining what type of facility to build...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...That's the big question.  
The problem is definitely boiling up.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
It is as if you were being requested for reinforcements by three different troops.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
If one is chosen, the other two will be sacrificed. Ugh...  
Must I pass royal judgment here too!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, the final decision will be ultimately made by Senpai...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Of course, us reliable Japanese Heroic Spirits recommend a standard kamado stove!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
It is the perfect embodiment of practicality and versatility, and it makes a perfect fire to cook rice!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
“First use low heat, then switch to high halfway through.” Just recite that incantation then steaming hot rice will appear!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
“And don't take off the lid even if your baby cries.” Baby... The one belonging to Master and me? Hehe...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
We'll leave Kiyohime off in la-la-land for now. Anyway, if we want to eat rice, a Japanese stove is the best!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
White rice. White rice. Sounds good.  
Very...good.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Um, you know what? I think we should make an oven that we can make pizza in.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Marie, I didn't know you like pizza.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
No, that's not what I meant. I don't know.  
I've never eaten one before.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Really?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Bet you've had tons of cake though... Never mind.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I've had some flat bread, of course, but nothing quite like pizza, you know?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
But I was watching Drake and the others at Chaldea enjoy some the other day...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
...and I saw Caesar stuff his face with pizza and soda once too...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
So I've always wanted to try it.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
But Sanson and Amadeus would always come in and say, “Marie, you mustn't eat such junk!”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sure they didn't want you to end up like Caesar.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
See? So please! Since Sanson and Amadeus aren't on this island, I want to try a pizza!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Pizza. Pizza. Sounds good.  
Very...good.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Pizza sounds good, yes, but that thing's a pain to bake.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
What's important is the quantity.  
I think we should have at least one huge-ass pot first.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
That's true. Nothing beats being able to make a large amount of food all at once.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
If we have a pot, I can make my special Bethanian stew for everyone.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Stew. Stew. Sounds good.  
Very...good.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Bah. We've got a king who can't decide. Useless.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Only Master's opinion is left at this point! Now, please choose which one to make! Listen to your stomach!  
  
  
## Project 3 Plan A: Let's Build a Hearth  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
... (Flash)  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Steamed to perfection! Okay, it's now or never!  
Let's open the pot!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Perfect timing! Ta-da! Perfect fluffy rice!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It looks delicious...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It smells amazing...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Heh heh. It was worth attending Uzume-chan's cooking classes!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
However, I haven't prepared any side dishes. Hmm. Should I just start with some rice balls?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I'll help, of course.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
My fiery nature allows me to fearlessly make rice balls no matter how piping hot the rice is!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
It's the perfect skill to have as Master's future bride, don't you think?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Done! Every grain of rice is precious, so please savor it!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks for the food!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
... (Staring)  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
... (Staring)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What a perfect balance of rice and salt!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This is so good (nom nom).  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Good, good! That's just the reaction I was hoping for!  
We made a lot, so the others can also have some.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well thank you... What a pleasant aroma.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I was confident that this would be the wisest choice.  
I was right in cheering you on.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I know this is for everyone, but if you will excuse me,  
I will help myself first.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Rice is the best.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What is it?  
  
   
## Project 3 Plan B: Let's Build a Pizza Oven  
   
**Marie:**   
I had no idea that pizza was so delicious!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. The toppings are simple, but it has been seasoned to perfection.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! (Munch munch)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Seafood... Potato... Meat Lovers...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Japanese style... Teriyaki Chicken... Curry...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Are those different pizza types? So many variations even though it's already so good! ...How intriguing.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
It's a mystery why Sanson and the others didn't let me eat something so tasty. Were they just being mean?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe it had something to do with etiquette...?  
   
**Marie:**   
Hmm? But you normally eat bread with your hands.  
This appears no different to me.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe it had something to do with the calories...  
   
**Marie:**   
Really? But I can't really eat that much anyway, so I think it's just right for me...  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
It may be an image issue. A princess eating pizza doesn't really...you know...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Or maybe...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Perhaps Sanson and the others didn't know what pizza tasted like.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh! Hee hee, you may be right.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I bet they both hate getting their hands greasy. They'd be like, “It interferes with our work,” or something like that.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Okay. When we get back to Chaldea, let's call both of them and hold a pizza party, shall we?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
We will have all kinds of pizza and cola... I wonder how they will react? Hee hee hee...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't forget to invite me.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Looking forward to it.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Yes! I can't wait!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah... It looks like they finished baking an extra pizza while we were deep in discussion.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This test batch seems to have turned out well, so we're going to keep churning them out. Please call over anyone who is free.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I was confident that this would be the wisest choice.  
I was right in cheering you on.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I know this is for everyone, but if you will excuse me, I will help myself first.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Pizza is the best.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What is it?  
  
   
## Project 3 Plan C: Let's Build a Giant Cauldron  
   
**Martha:**   
Now we'll just let it simmer for a bit...  
It will be done soon, Master.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Heh, heh. Now there's a nice sight! A pot filled to the brim with stew. That's what a real meal should look like.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did you grow up in a huge household or something?!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh? You know, Father used to...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
N-Never mind. This just reminded me of the time we were marching.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Whether the soldiers get enough food or not really affects the outcome of a battle, you know?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
A soldier's stamina is a factor that partly affects their performance, but as long as you fill their stomachs they won't complain as much.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
On the flip side, an army can easily break apart as food supplies decrease. After all, an army marches on its stomach.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
That's why the quantity of the food is what matters most. The quantity! I believe you chose wisely, Master!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
As for me...I had a younger brother and sister in my household.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Since we had to cook relatively large meals to feed us all, I'm quite used to seeing this amount of food too.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
 You're like a big sister. I can tell.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
And you know what else? I was one of those people who always prepared a little extra in case an unexpected visitor dropped in.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Like when a certain someone and His disciples dropped by.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I've always wanted to have cooking utensils that would whip up so much food all at once, much like a party this size.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh! Dear me, it's about time to take it off the heat.  
Taste test, taste test.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Okay, just right. Now then, everyone had better eat this, or it would have been pointless making a whole potful.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Is there anyone nearby?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I was confident that this would be the wisest choice.  
I was right in cheering you on.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I know this is for everyone, but if you will excuse me,  
I will help myself first.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Stew is the best.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What is it?  
  
   
## Project 4: Let's Build a Bathhouse  
   
**Mash:**   
We may be Demi-Servants and Servants, but we cannot look the other way anymore.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We are ladies&ndash;and more than anything, that should be what takes priority here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Therefore, Senpai, please build a bathing facility!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's important hygienically, too.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, that's right. It's not just about body odor: this is a health issue as well.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If Ms. Nightingale were here right now, I'm sure she would also agree.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She would've made a rubbing alcohol bath and tossed us into it.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yes...! Finally!  
   
**Mash:**   
(I've never seen Senpai look so serious!)  
  
   
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Mikon! Come on, we're on a deserted island.  
We're surrounded by nature!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
If Master is going to make a bathing facility, there's only one way to go.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
When I say fox, you say ears! Fox! Ears! When I say wife, you say Tamamo! Wife! Tamamo! And in this spirit, if I say nature, you say...? That's right, an open-air bath!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
What, it's embarrassing? It'll be all right.  
You'll eventually come to enjoy it. Heeheehee.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Bathing, eh? I don't really care about that.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Aye. The only bathing we did on our voyage was when it rained.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
We could make do with just a simple shower.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Agreed! All we need is to rinse off sweat in a jiffy!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I think we should have a normal bathing facility.  
Neither too big nor too small.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
One with proper walls and a ceiling...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
That's right. Deserted island or not, we must still think about modesty and being maidenly.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I'd like to point out that the Roman style is especially sinful.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Fortunately, there are no Romans among us.  
I mean, men and women bathing together naked...?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Surely you understand that the good times will come AFTER we actually build the thing? Think hard, then take action! That's all!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Ah, but let me just say one more thing.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
My fox ears have picked up some very important information.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
... (Flash)  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Unfortunately, there'll be no event CGs... regardless of what you choose!  
  
  
## Project 4 Plan A: Let's Build an Open-Air Bath  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Ahhhh... An open-air bath really does have a certain charm to it, doesn't it?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Look around.  
There are many lovely things surrounding us.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
To be able to experience directly through my skin...this is the true charm of an open-air bath.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
The beautiful moon, the rustling trees, the eerie calls of strange birds flying by... Um, perhaps ignore the last one.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Ummm, oh yes. The loveliest one of all is of course your wonderful socialite-fox-wife soaking next to you in the water.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
D-Do we really need to bathe together?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(I'm not sure where I should look.)  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Come on, we're both wearing swimsuits, so it's fine.  
It's no different from our usual manner.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
You really are adorably innocent, Master.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
In any case, the whole purpose of this occasion is to assess whether we can make proper use of this bathing establishment.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
It will be pointless if we don't fully relax while we're here. Which is why I came prepared with a few things.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Here's a wooden pail with a Japanese-style wine flask.  
It only has water inside, but I wanted you to try it out.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hydration is important.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I actually did want to try it, at least once.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
You downed that wonderfully. (Clap clap)  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
It would have been an even more lively moon-viewing party if Shuten had been here.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Though I can easily imagine it getting out of hand very quickly...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I prefer a quiet night tonight.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Hee hee, yes, indeed. After all, we've got the open-air bath all to ourselves.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Let's savor our alone time a bit more.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
So how about we have a candid talk while we bathe together?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I'm prepared to fully answer any questions Master throws at me.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
For example...what I'm doing with my prized tail while I'm soaking in the water.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
To be honest, it's a tad embarrassing...but if Master would like to know, you may go around to my rear to take a look.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Or perhaps...perhaps you would like to reach around to feel everything yourself?  
  
   
## Project 4 Plan B: Let's Build a Shower  
   
**Mordred:**   
Wow! This shower is amazing! I feel great!  
Okay, I'm off to ride the waves again!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
She came to wash off the seawater, but she's going back in again.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
It's called an infinite loop. I've heard about it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um...  
  
   
**Mary:**   
But what's great about a shower is how easy it is.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Yeah. There's nothing you have to do to prepare.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
UM!?  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Yes?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
What is it?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why are we all in the same shower room?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's too cramped...for three people.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
This is an experiment to see if we can use the shower properly, right? We might have missed something if we came in alone.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
That's right. As the ones who suggested this, we have the responsibility to check it out.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's fine, but things are touching...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're like sardines in a can!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Hehe, we used to wash each other in the rain, didn't we Mary?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Yup, yup. That was the only fun thing to do during boring voyages. And there's something special about Anne washing me clean.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
So, how about we all wash each other?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
That's worth trying, isn't it?  
  
   
**Anne & Mary:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Give up and go with the flow.)  
  
   
## Project 4 Plan C: Let's Build a Japanese Cypress Bath  
   
**Altria:**   
Yes! This is how a bath should be! Wonderful!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
This is like the barrel bath you would take in an old mansion in Japan. It is very calming.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Yes, the confined space is just right. The walls and ceilings are built to last too. There's none of the indecency you find in a Roman bath.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Master told us to check how good this bathing facility is, but...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I feel a little guilty to be the first one to bathe.  
Maybe we should have let Master go first.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
We're taking advantage of Master's generosity.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Well, if you are careful, two people can just fit in here.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
You could have taken a bath with Master instead of me.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Never mind! That was an indecent suggestion, wasn't it? It's that wicked Roman custom that caught up to me!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
By the way, may I ask you something?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What is it?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
You're the King of Britain, right?  
Why did you suggest a Japanese-style bath?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...Why indeed. I don't know myself, but somehow&ndash;  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Bathing here gives me vague flashbacks from when I was a main heroine... Somehow... Maybe...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
What?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Like I said, I don't know.  
It's probably just a feeling.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
It's like it struck me.  
It's like this bath and I were meant to be.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
... (Gasp!)  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Now what? Why are you looking around?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I just had a bad feeling strike me.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
It was like a vision of some other Servant bathing in this kind of bath, like she is the focal point...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Rider...Medusa.  
Perhaps it's a good thing she's not here!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...I really don't get what you're talking about.  
  
   
## Project 5: Let's Make a Vegetable Garden  
   
**Scáthach:**   
It's about time we set our sights on a stable food supply.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I'm talking about a field.  
We shall cultivate a vegetable field.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're starting with vegetables?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yes. It's easier to grow vegetables than grain, so that's what we'll start with.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Master can choose what kinds will be planted.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Vegetables...? There are so many kinds.  
What should we do, Senpai?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
How about something normal, like daikon radishes?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You can boil them, stew them, or put them in miso soup. There is a plethora of recipes using daikon.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Home cooking filled with my love...my ingredients will enter Master's mouth, go down your throat, pass into the stomach,  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...And it will all assimilate with your cells.  
In other words, you and I will become one!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Aaah, it's like you and I would be mating! Squee!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I see. Daikon.  
Yes, I do like daikon simmered with fish.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
I think we should grow cabbage.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
You have a point there. It can be used in just as many recipes as daikon.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Plus, cabbage is like a savior to sailors.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I see. Cabbage.  
I do like stuffed cabbage rolls.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, wait a second.  
You're all forgetting something important.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What's that?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
The fact that it's summer and we're on an island!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Which means, there's one obvious thing we have to grow: watermelons!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't get it, but that confidence blows me away!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oh right, watermelon is grown like a vegetable.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Oh? I see. It might be interesting to try going in that direction.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I see. Watermelon.  
I'm the type who doesn't eat it with a spoon.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-This is starting to get out of hand...  
Senpai, please make a swift decision!  
  
  
## Project 5 Plan A: Let's Make a Radish Field  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
This is the first meal we're making with daikon radish.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Out of my repertoire of recipes, I chose a dish that best allows its flavor to stand out!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I can't wait!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Interesting. And what is that, milady?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oden!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Here you are, Master. I'll be the one to feed you, obviously. Open wide!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um... It's summer...and this is the tropics...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can feel the heat just getting near it!  
   
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Are you...are you saying that you won't eat it...?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Are you saying that my daikon radishes aren't worth eating? That I'm a worthless woman...?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
No...not again...Anchin...you lie...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I... I'll eat it! I'll eat it!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my! Master, you had me going for a second there! Don't do that! Ahem, let us resume. Say ahhh!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A-Ahh... Gwah!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my! You're weeping tears of joy, Master!  
Your face is bright red, and you're drenched in sweat!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
So this must be what I was talking about before.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
A little bit of me has gotten inside your body, mingling... Oh my!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I'm so happy, Master! Please have more!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...! ...!?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Don't worry. There's plenty to go around.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You there, spying on us, please come over and try some as well.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I'm satisfied that Master was able to have the first bite from my own hands. You can all join in now.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry. I wasn't hiding. I just missed my chance to come in!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But at this point, I shall join you, Master...!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
(Huff, huff) It's definitely hot, but it's not bad.  
The flavors have really soaked in. It's delicious!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Wh-When did she get here!?)  
  
   
## Project 5 Plan B: Let's Make a Cabbage Field  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou! (Chomp, chomp)  
  
   
**Anne:**   
My, look at how you're inhaling that, Fou.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
They're delicious cooked and raw.  
Cabbages are great.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You were saying cabbage was a savior...?  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Yes. They saved sailors from a certain disease.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
...A scary disease called scurvy.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Even in our era, many sailors died from scurvy.  
If only we'd known about it sooner...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Scurvy?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think I've heard of that...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Scurvy is a disease that comes from a lack of vitamin C. It used to be a real problem for sailors on long journeys.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But once sauerkraut, or pickled cabbage&ndash;which is high in vitamin C&ndash;began to be used as preserved food...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
it finally became possible to prevent scurvy.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
That's right. So I figured that cabbage would also be good luck for us pirates.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Luck is something very important to us pirates.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
On a sea voyage, so much of what's around you is beyond your control.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
And we had to live with that for a long time, in a place where everyone's lives were on the line.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
In a situation like that, you'd want to cling to anything that might bring good luck.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
All kinds of stuff used to happen on long voyages.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Picking a certain kind of food can change everyone's fate...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm sure these cabbages will bring us good luck.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Yes, you're right, Master.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Okay, I'm tired of eating them raw.  
Let's make some other type of cabbage dish.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
We can summon everyone here and have a cabbage party.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
A cabbage party. I like the sound of that. By the way, are there any plans on making stuffed cabbage?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Wh-When did she get here!?)  
  
   
## Project 5 Plan C: Let's Make a Watermelon Field  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I saw this coming...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If there're watermelons, then...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai.  
You were right to see this coming.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Right! No, left! Actually, it might be sideways!  
Or maybe above you!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmph. You think I'll fall for that?  
It's... HERE!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Damn! She never misses! The Queen of the Land of Shadows has truly mastered all forms of combat, including the watermelon split!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I've heard rumors about splitting watermelons.  
I always wanted to try it... but I guess this is all it is.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
It's not very beneficial for training.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Wait a moment, Scáthach.  
It's time for me to get serious.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Don't think you've won yet.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Oh? Very well. Show me what you've got.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
(Father... What incredible intensity! Taking the wooden sword and approaching it with a slow and steady step...)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Ah, a bit more to the left...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Quiet. Shut up. You are distracting me.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Ugh. H-Humph! I was just being nice and leading you in the right... I mean, wrong direction! You're no fun!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(She's actually a bit off...I hope it's all right.)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Left! More to the left!)  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I've got it! It's here! Hahh!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
MANA BURST!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-The incredible waves from the Mana Burst have blown up pretty much everything around her!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Of course the watermelon's split, but...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
(Sigh)  
  
   
**Altria:**   
(Grin)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Wh-Whoa! Do you see that, Master?  
That smug look?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Wow! That was sooooo childish! Being competitive is one thing, but that...! F-Father, you're really something!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh wait! I can't just stand here stunned.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Wait up! I want to do it again!  
I'll use my Mana Burst!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Here, Senpai. Please have a shard of fresh watermelon that just landed near us.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...It's good...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, it is. It's not right to waste food, so tonight's dinner is likely going to be just watermelon...  
  
   
## Project 6: Let's Make a Grain Field  
   
**Scáthach:**   
All right, shall we finally grow some staple foods?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. We've already run out of the meager amount of grains we brought from Chaldea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A field of staple foods will give us a steady supply of ingredients to make various dishes in the cooking facility.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Staple foods, huh?  
Well, wouldn't that obviously be wheat?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Whoa, one more word and I'm taking that as sacrilege against rice! To us Japanese Heroic Spirits, rice is supreme! Rice is love itself!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Like they say, “The boughs that bear most hang lowest!”  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Huh? You're wondering why I just used a proverb that says even the greatest people should be humble?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
It just sounded good!  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Maybe corn would be good.  
It is delicious, you know.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Aye, that is very piratey.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't really see how corn is “piratey.”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, how can I put this? Our group is divided along the lines of the world's three major grains.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All of them grow in abundance and are tasty, so it's hard to say which is best. Please make your decision, Master!  
  
  
## Project 6 Plan A: Let's Make a Wheat Field  
   
**Martha:**   
Wheat fields... They bring back memories.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's staring off into the distance...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She's so picturesque even without her staff...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wheat is a very old crop. It's been harvested for over 10,000 years.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As she has been around the beginning of the Common Era, we see her as someone from the distant past.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yet even for her, wheat was a natural part of the world.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And when you look at it from a different perspective, it still exists in our world today.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The way history and time form a continuous chain feels strange to me.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
My, what a serious conversation.  
Ah, and speaking of serious...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
If I had to hold a sermon over a wheat field, the topic should naturally be wheat. Shall I tell you about the Parable of the Tares? Or maybe the Parable of the Grain of Wheat?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wh-Why is she preaching all of a sudden?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Lately I feel so weird without my staff!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
If I don't tap into that side of myself, I feel I may not be able to revert back once summer is over.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
So it's time for a sermon. A very important one.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I-I've gotta go...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Huh!? I said it was very important!  
Don't talk back to me, minion!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Now kneel! Right there!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(It feels like this is having the opposite effect...  
Does she even realize that?)  
  
   
## Project 6 Plan B: Let's Make a Rice Paddy  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Mikon! That's what I want to see!  
Thank you, Master!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Naturally when you think of rice, you think of me, and when you think of me, you think of rice.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
You could say that it was me who spread this stuff throughout Japan. Though you'd have to go way back in time...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Either way, the color of the ear of rice is just like my fur, and we are both delicious when eaten.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
In the end, I hope that when you see rice crops, you'll think of my tail and want to stroke it!  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Well, would you look at this? It may not be long before you see my magnificent use of the scythe, Master.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Looking forward to it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Gulp) Kischur Zelretch effect...with a scythe?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Glad to see you're eager to help.  
Harvest season is always a bit of a pain.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
If only Tawara were here... No, I mustn't think of him... No, no.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
His Noble Phantasm is like cheating.  
It just keeps making more and more rice.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I mean, sure it's convenient.  
But it's like he's taking all the fun out of harvesting.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It tastes the best when you harvest it with your own hands.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Yep, good for you, Master!  
You get it!  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
But sadly, Tawara's rice is delicious.  
Oops, just remembering it is making me drool.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Thinking of that cheating Noble Phantasm is forbidden! There's no point in complaining about what we don't have!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
A child who is a handful is the most lovable.  
In that sense, we shall pour our love into this rice field!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Excuse me. Did you mention something about Master's child?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
No...Master. Anchin...did you...with another woman...!?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I did not say that, so please stop breathing flames, Kiyohime...  
  
   
## Project 6 Plan C: Let's Make a Corn Field  
   
**Mary:**   
What a marvelous cornfield!  
Thank you, Master!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
It looks like we'll be able to harvest a generous amount of corn, no?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes... By the way, you mentioned something earlier, but how are corn and pirates connected?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Right. Mash, Master.  
Where do you think is famous for its corn?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Andes?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No clue...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes... I feel like America would surpass other countries in amount of corn produced.  
  
   
  
   
**Mary:**   
Right. Originally, corn was almost only found in the Americas.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
But, at some point it spread to Europe, where we lived at the time.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
One man brought it back to Europe from the American continent.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Yes. The man's name was Christopher Columbus.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I've heard of him.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He crossed the Atlantic, right?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
It wasn't just corn, either.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Because of him, all kinds of things started to spread throughout Europe that were not formerly there.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I have heard that his actions led to an unprecedented exchange of flora, fauna, and culture   
   
**Mash:**   
between the Western and Eastern Hemispheres.  
They call this phenomenon the “Columbian Exchange.”  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Oh, I didn't know there was a term for it.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Well, label it however you like.  
But if you think about it, it's pretty amazing, right?  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Things that people never knew existed...  
  
   
**Anne:**   
People from opposite parts of the world probably had no idea other things existed in other places.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Yet such unimaginable things began to spread into their culture one after the other until they were regarded as normal. What people took for granted was completely transformed.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
So, here's my thinking.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Columbus's long voyage robbed both continents of their so-called “common knowledge.”  
  
   
**Mary:**   
In that sense, that would make Columbus the great forefather of pirates like us.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
So we're going to show our respect to our great founder with this cornfield.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Maybe someday we will be lucky enough to plunder some great treasure that will shock the whole world!  
  
   
## Project 7: Let's Build a Ranch  
   
**Altria:**   
Anything is fine with me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Argh! This is no good, Senpai. Altria is already resolved to accept everything with a bodhisattva-like smile!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
That being said, this is our first farm. We must decide wisely on what kind of livestock to raise.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...I, for one, recommend standard cattle.  
For their meat and their milk.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yes. Eating meat gives you strength!  
Don't eat it and you won't get strength! It's simple logic!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
My, my. Sex appeal takes a backseat to appetite for some of these people.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hngh! Are you any different, fox-ears?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Normally I may stray to my feral instincts. Cat as well.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
But in my current form, I'm a well-to-do fox shrine maiden by the shore.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
So instead of making a decision based on my feral nature, I'll go for an aristocratic and elegant decision!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Therefore, let's go with sheep. Yes, sheep. We can also expand our development by using their high-grade wool to make clothes!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
And we can use the meat from the others as provisions.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But you're in swimsuits...  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
There are many other uses for it as well.  
I'll give you the details on that once we do it!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Fluffy wool, huh? Fluffy sounds good.  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Ah! Uh-oh! Did I just dig myself a hole!?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Nah, it's not like wool holds a candle to my tail, right? Wool is just expendable.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Among the big fluffy four, wool is the weakest!  
That's why I recommend it with my head held high!  
  
   
  
   
**Anne:**   
Then why don't we go with chickens?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
We can eat 'em, use the feathers for this and that, and they seem they'd be easier to raise than sheep.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
By the way, speaking of making a farm, the idea isn't to actually create animals out of nothing, is it?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Correct. We will need to find the first pair of animals somewhere. Then we'll have them mate and reproduce.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I like how you can talk about “mating” with a straight face.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I like how you can talk about“reproducing” with a straight face.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
You've got a shady look in your eyes, Master,  
but I'll let it go.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
At any rate, whichever it may be, the amount of wildlife we find on the island will likely make our choice.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
What a convenient coincidence. Earlier, I found a place that had a whole brood of tasty-looking birds.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
The more animals we get on the farm from the beginning, the better, aye? Based on that, birds are easiest, I reckon.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Besides, those birds move slowly and can't fly.  
We don't have to worry about them escaping.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmmm.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I'll say it one more time.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Anything is fine with me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I knew it. She's listening to our conversation and nodding her head in agreement. It's as if all she can see is the future.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What a deep gaze!  
Could this be what is called a state of nirvana!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think she's just dazed from hunger.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
  
## Project 7 Plan A: Let's Build a Cattle Ranch  
   
**Mordred:**   
Awesome! A barbecue party!  
Nothing beats eating meat after surfing.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
The venison earlier wasn't bad, but beef is the way to go for barbecue!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Haha. Hey, is this one cooked?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Wait. That is the meat I am preparing.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
There are exactly 12 seconds left until it is cooked to perfection. Do not interfere.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Wow, really? Sorry 'bout that.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
(Or so I say! While she's looking the other way, I'll just help myself!)  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Gáe&ndash;Bolg!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I believe I told you...not to interfere.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
N-No! I was, uh, just trying to take that pepper next to it.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Oh. My apologies. Eat as many peppers as you wish.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
D-Damn... (Munch, munch)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Ugh, it's so bitter... Unbelievable... Gáe Bolg using her leg... Did she develop that especially to throw it while barbecuing?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, another tasty piece of meat!  
I'm getting it this time&ndash;  
  
   
**Altria:**   
&mdash;Calibur!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I am preparing that meat.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...You do your usurper name justice.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
W-Waaaahhh! I hate you, Father!  
  
   
## Project 7 Plan B: Let's Build a Sheep Ranch  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Ooooh☆ Looks like we'll be able to get some marvelous woolen cloth now. Thank you, Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you gonna make a wool swimsuit or something?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Were you really low on clothes?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Silly. With wool, I can make that amazing thing that is great at absorbing and retaining moisture...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...A futon. Oh my!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A good night's sleep is important...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why would you get embarrassed by that?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I came along since I heard there was a sheep ranch!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Perfect timing. Sheep need a shepherd.  
Should I hold a sermon about proper shepherding? Or...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh. I forgot there is an occupation called shepherding. Though if anything, I would probably be a sheepdog.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
The runes in the fence eliminate the need for direct supervision, but it would be ideal to have a shepherd.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
David would be best for that. If he were here, I would definitely ask him to do it.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
To have King David revert to his former occupation seems somewhat insolent... Would that be appropriate?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He might actually get excited doing it.  
   
**Mash:**   
True. As long as he doesn't ask for money or women in exchange...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He said managing a ranch was his dream...  
   
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
But it might be boring because it's too perfect.  
Are there any other shepherds with us?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I have heard King Romulus was a shepherd.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae & Martha:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
...Rome.  
  
   
**Sheep:**   
Baa baa...  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Rome!  
  
   
**Sheep:**   
Baaaaa!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
You all dare defy me? Rome is that way! Rome!  
  
   
**Sheep:**   
B-Baa, baa!!!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I...definitely wouldn't entrust him with any sheep...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No comment.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
## Project 7 Plan C: Let's Build a Chicken Ranch  
   
**Anne:**   
Thank you, Master!  
What a wonderful coop!  
  
   
**Mary:**   
I caught the bird we mentioned earlier.  
What do you think, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's cute.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's like...a fluffy duck.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!?  
  
   
**Anne:**   
It's slow and it doesn't fly. It's pretty cute.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
It lays its eggs in a place that's easy to access, and its meat is delicious.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
...It's much better than those birds we were forced to catch and eat at sea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm just speaking from memory, so I may be wrong, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Isn't this bird a dodo...?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Aren't those...extinct?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I've heard of them.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. The dodo was discovered in the 16th century, but due to overhunting, it went extinct in less than 100 years.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Since it couldn't fly, it had no way to protect itself from its enemies...  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Master, shall we get one?  
I want to see how it tastes.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
How shall we eat it? I'll get a fire started.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, wait...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash, that's just a rare bird. Got it?  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right. Let's... just leave it at that.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If we just breed more, there should be no problem!  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right!  
This is a ranch, so we need to increase their numbers!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
I feel like an unexpected sense of responsibility has befallen us...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There will be more if they give birth, and there will be less if we eat them. I know that is common sense, but it is quite difficult to manage living creatures.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, let's try not to overdo things...  
  
   
## Project 8: Let's Build a Pathway  
   
**Altria:**   
I think we should be focusing on... “infrastructure maintenance”? Is that what it was?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
We've all gotten used to procuring materials.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
So I believe if we improve the route to carry them, our efficiency should increase.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Spoken like a true king.  
   
**Altria:**   
Th-That's what I am! A king! At all times!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Admittedly I may not look the part while in this swimsuit.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Good idea. I'm in!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
So what are we doing? Shall we make it out of wood? Like a ranch-style footpath?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
That wouldn't change things much, would it?  
It may take some time, but I propose a cobblestone path.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
As long as we're at it, why not spend a bit more time?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What ever do you mean, Sir Mordred?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Heh heh. We're going to make a path for the sake of convenience, right? Then why don't we make it even more convenient?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I'm saying, let's build a mine cart!  
Yesss! Now I'm fired up!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Well, Master, the decision is yours.  
Please make a wise choice.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
H-Huh?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Dammit. What? My idea is much better than just a stupid simple path. It's fast...and I bet it'll be fun.  
  
   
## Project 9: Let's Build an Aqueduct  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Humans made their lives easier with the invention of streets. What would come next?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I shall ask you, Fujimaru, on behalf of humankind. Answer my question.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think they would want even more convenience!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Exactly. Some say that it is pitiable, while some say that humans continuously test themselves for an easier life. It's tough to judge...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So, the next is a watercourse.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
My plan is to make it easier to secure fresh water by building a channel to bring water directly into the water storage facility.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
No objection. Wood would give it a nice, gentle feel.  
I'd like that.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
If we build a simple waterwheel with wood scraps,  
I'm sure it will help us in different ways too.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
But wouldn't a stone channel be sturdier?  
I think it'll look more stylish, too.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Wait a sec. I'm sure there's something... There's definitely something more awesome we could build using Scáthach's skills, you know?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
So, I suggest building a pipeline.  
Don't you think it'll be stylish and super cool?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Because, man, everything you guys suggest lack romance.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, of course, I'm not talking about that wishy-washy guy!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I haven't heard that word in a while, and it brings back memories. I wonder how Doctor Roman is doing...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I know we're all feeling nostalgic, but Senpai, please make a choice!  
  
  
## Project 8 Plan A: Let's Build a Ranch Path  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh, how I love this idyllic feel!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
By merely hardening the ground and setting up wooden handrails, I think it is a lot easier to walk along now.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
But this path still has one problem.  
Or at least that's what I think.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
And what would that be?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll work to fix it.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh, no, it's not your fault at all. Rather, it's mine.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
This path is so rustic that I can't shake the feeling that there's a farm up ahead.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
If I'm not careful, I'll get so excited that I might just start running.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Like...you're full of youthful energy?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Like...you're sexually frustrated?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Hmm, how do I put it? My feral nature, I guess.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I'm Tamamo Summer, a monster of summer, so I feel like I can't hold back...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Does that mean you might run around cheerfully like Tamamo Cat? I would like to see that, actually.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Yeah! Exactly!  
But that's embarrassing, so I'm holding it in!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Listen, I am different from that thing! My swimsuit version is entirely different to begin with!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right, umm...I am sorry...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Humph...but, anyway.  
The scent of this new path is quite nice.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I get this feeling like there are defenseless livestock waiting up ahead...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Gah, I can't hold back! I know it's silly, but I'm going to run up this path a bit to vent my wild side!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
If I come across a wild rabbit or something I'll bring it back for you, so look forward to my return!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ever since we've come to this island...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Tamamo-no-Mae seems to be exhibiting an eccentricity similar to that of Tamamo Cat...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Shhh!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's pretend we haven't noticed...  
  
   
## Project 8 Plan B: Let's Build a Cobblestone Path  
   
**Altria:**   
This is a wonderful stone road.  
Master, I am impressed.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, it seems so European. A horse-drawn carriage would not seem out of place here...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Out of all the stone roads...I think the Appian Way is the most famous.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We may have walked on it when we were in Rome.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. As far as I recall it was a solid road.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Rome's great road?  
Even in my time I had heard tales of it.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Well, if I may say so myself, the cobblestone paths in my Camelot were quite fine as well.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Mash, you must be thinking how competitive I am again.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What? Oh, no...I am sorry...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry, I thought that too.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Shocked)  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...Master, you too? Hah, I do not mind.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
If Nero and Caesar were here with us, they would no doubt boast about the superiority of Roman roads.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
It simply means we are filled with pride for our own nations. It is impossible to proclaim one better than the other.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Thus, when such patriotic feelings clash, it is not easy to resolve anything.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Altria...?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
It is nothing. Let us head back.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Stone roads remind me of knights marching home. Their armored heels clanking on them made such loud noises.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
But the sound of sandals going pitter-patter on stone is also charming in its own way.  
  
   
## Project 8 Plan C: Let's Build a Railroad Track  
   
**Mordred:**   
Whoa! A hairpin turn!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Don't get so cocky!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Ugh, I don't like brakes. I prefer a rudder!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah...oh dear...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We should have realized about it sooner.  
The most dangerous thing about carts is...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, carts...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are too much fun to drive...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai. Thanks to that, Riders are running wild.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Thanks, Master!  
Thanks to you we can have an exciting battle...  
  
   
**Mary:**   
We won't be able to catch up unless we push harder!  
  
   
**Mary:**   
We'll clear this curve if I throw all my weight to one side, so maintain current speed!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Aye aye!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I was able to tame the Tarasque dragon.  
No way am I gonna lose to a cart... Full speed ahead!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah! You won't make the turn at that speed!  
You'll go off the track!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're tilting!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Take that!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
B-By pushing the ground back with her fist, she was able to put the cart back on track!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Don't underestimate me, you little brats!  
Come baaack...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Master. What shall we do?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They'll get bored and come back eventually.  
  
  
## Project 9 Plan A: Let's Build a Wooden Aqueduct  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Wow...Thank you, Master.  
It's a soothing, simple watercourse.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
And there is a small waterwheel, too...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So it's a system that turns the water's moving energy into rotational energy semi-permanently.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's simple, but amazing.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Technology that's been used for thousands of years...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. It's like I can actually see human knowledge take shape. I may be exaggerating a bit.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I wonder who was the first one to invent it?  
   
**Mash:**   
...Sorry, I don't know.  
Who could it be?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
When we return to Chaldea, I will thoroughly search the database...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And hand in a well-organized and comprehensive report. I promise!  
  
   
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Oh-ho. I thought I heard a familiar sound.  
A waterwheel, huh? That is nice. Very nice.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
A familiar sound?  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
I am the son of a farmer.  
Even my village had a waterwheel.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
I had no special feelings for it back then, but now that I hear it in a deserted tropical island like this...  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
I never expected it could be so refined.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Refined...huh?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I don't care if you think it's refined or elegant, but I was enjoying a moment of relaxation with Master.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
The more people disturb us, the less cozy I can get with Master. Hurry up, do your business, and go away.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
I have no business. I simply came over attracted to this sound.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Mash and Master. I won't say it is a bad thing to admire the handiness of waterwheels or their history.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
But it is also good to simply close your eyes and lend your ears to the splashing sound of water and creaking lumber.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foufooou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, Fou was itching to do something and finally jumped on top of the waterwheel, using it like an exercise machine!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fouuu, fouuu♪  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He looks like he's enjoying it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This reminds me of something...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Is that elegant, too...?  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Of course. I just came up with a haiku: At the bottom right / Continuously running / The creature sprints on.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Ah yes, how elegant. The first line “At the bottom right” seems meaningless, but it actually displays my remarkable poetic sense. Heh heh.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The road to elegance still seems to elude me.  
  
   
## Project 9 Plan B: Let's Build a Stone Aqueduct  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh, it's a wonderful watercourse.  
Thank you, Master.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I especially like the part that looks like a bridge.  
Hehe, it is like Pont du Gard.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm glad you noticed.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Pont du Gard... A famous stone aqueduct that crosses the Gardon River in France.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It is also a World Heritage site, if I'm not mistaken.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Yes, it is. It's big and very beautiful.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Ahem. It must be a work of Roman architecture.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I do respect other countries' cultures, Master.  
But as you command a great number of Servants...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I must advise that favoring a specific culture too much can cause unnecessary friction.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
It seems you have become a sort of Romaniac.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I didn't mean to be obsessed over it.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But Rome is the best, Rome.  
   
**Altria:**   
Ugh, could it be? Maybe Master is being brainwashed by King Romulus!? This is a grave situation!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry, Altria. That was probably Master's joke.  
  
   
  
   
**Marie:**   
Humph, no. Master is actually a Francophile, right?  
This is a French structure, after all.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, not really...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Vive la France!  
   
**Marie:**   
Yes, yes! Vive la France!  
  
   
  
   
**Altria:**   
(Sigh) Master is so...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Perhaps I should assert myself and request for something British to be built...  
  
   
## Project 9 Plan C: Let's Build a Pipe Aqueduct  
   
**Mash:**   
(Oh. Where are Senpai and Mordred?)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Gently, gently.  
That's it, right there...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
L-Like this?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Here I go.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Idiot, don't be so rough!  
I told you the moment you put it in is the most critical!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(...!)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, that's it, that's nice. It's in.  
Oh, yes! That's good!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Master, you got pretty good skills. Hehe.  
Now let's move on to&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Ahem!  
Fou, Fou! Where are you?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, f-fancy seeing you here!  
I was just looking for Fou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I wasn't trying to interrupt whatever you might be doing.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
You came at a good time. Look at this, the pipeline. Master just connected this part.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
The water coming from here runs through here, and then it splits here and there. It's nice and systematic!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
## Project 10: Let's Build a Bridge  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Here we are! It's “Let's Make Our Lives Easier: Part 3”!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
As such, let's build a bridge, Master!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
We Servants can leap over rivers or ravines in a single huge bound, so this idea was conceived with you in mind, Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It certainly would help a lot.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Taking the long way round is such a pain.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Well, now that we have a great road, it would be much more efficient if we built a bridge connected to the places hard to reach for you.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
There are lots of beautiful bridges in Japan.  
Maybe we should build a wooden one similar to those?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Master and I on a beautiful bridge... Slowly, silently we walk... Our hands touch... We stare at each other and... Tee hee.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Japanese bridges, hmm? I admit they are beautiful, but I somehow picture them to be fragile.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
So I suggest we mainly make one out of stone.  
A combined stone gate and drawbridge will give us the perfect defense.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Wow, Father just said what I would have suggested... Heh heh.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
N-No! I counter that opinion for the sake of stirring things up!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Nobody will be satisfied with a plain old bridge like that. It's time to take advantage of Scáthach's skills again.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Let's look at things differently. Why stick to a bridge?  
All the thing needs to do is let us cross a river and such.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Which is why I'm suggesting&ndash;a ropeway!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
(Hehe... Looks like my bold idea has left you speechless...!)  
  
  
## Project 10 Plan A: Let's Build a Wooden Bridge  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, this is like the Gojo Bridge that once existed in Kyoto! Right?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that where Ushiwakamaru and Benkei met?  
   
**Mash:**   
Correct, Senpai. If Ushiwakamaru and Benkei were here, it might have made them feel nostalgic.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How elegant...  
   
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Well, well. What a refined bridge you've constructed.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Ugh, you again, Mr. Elegance.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Hahaha, I'm just passing by again. I have no intention of interrupting your moment of relaxation with Master.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
However, they say that bridges are inhabited by evil spirits. It may be a perfect fit for you, Kiyohime.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
I shall excuse myself for now. Hm, listening to the creaks of the bridge floor also gives one a sense of elegance.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
But it would be most elegant if I could have a duel with an evil monk who's after my sword on this bridge. I wish it would happen to me.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
An evil spirit? Did you know about it?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A Japanese-style bridge and Kojirou...A great combination.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, it is quite picturesque.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
By the way, Kiyohime, do you know about the evil spirit Kojirou has mentioned?  
  
   
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes, I have heard that something named Hashihime exists. It is a female oni that dwells under a bridge.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Whether it is fitting for me or not would be at the discretion of Master's.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
The keywords include “love,” “jealousy,” and “curse”... Something like that. Would you like to hear more details?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's pretty fitting already.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I get the picture! (Sweat)  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
The story goes that if one compliments a different bridge or woman atop the bridge that Hashihime lives under, they'll be cursed to death.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Of course, in my case, I am not confined to the top of the bridge.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
No matter where it happens, I will never fail to hear either words of love towards me or words of infidelity towards other women.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
In other words, the whole world is a bridge called me, and Master is the one who crosses such a bridge all the time.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my... The idea that Master is always stepping on me somehow excites me...!  
  
   
## Project 10 Plan B: Let's Build a Drawbridge  
   
**Altria:**   
Hm. If you do like this right here&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The drawbridge is going up.  
It seems to be working properly.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Our defenses are perfect now. The bridge is an important landmark. We should guard it properly.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do you have any bitter memories associated with this?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Sure, many of them.  
There were plenty of enemies during my time.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
The Picts and Saxons attacking, bandits and insurgent troops going berserk during times of chaos...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
There were countless times when we had to destroy our own bridge with tears in our eyes. After repelling the enemy, the futility of rebuilding it...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
But with a drawbridge, we have no need to worry about such a thing.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
There's not a single scratch on it since it's brand-new. How beautiful...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, do you hear something?  
It's coming from upriver...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yippee! Rafting downriver is fun once in a while!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Whoa, what the heck is that bridge!?Aw, crap! I'll have to...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She jumped, slid across the bridge, and...landed back on the river!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Woo-hoo! Oh hey, Master, Mash and...Fatherrr!?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
A...a long scratch on the bridge...  
It was no match against Prydwen...!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Sir Mordred. What you just shaved is a brand-new bridge that was built just a moment ago. Do you understand!?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
W-Well, I didn't do it on purpose!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Y-You dumbass!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Like I care! If it was that important to you, you should've put it in a glass case or something, you moron...  
Sorry, Father.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Master. Your permission to release the Noble Phantasm's True Name.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Tone down the family arguments.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
What are you talking about, Master?  
This is not a family argument.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
All I am trying to do is punish the driftwood-like thing that damaged our brand-new bridge.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Now please, grant me permission. It's still in range.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
## Project 10 Plan C: Let's Build a Ropeway  
   
**Mordred:**   
Wow! My best time yet!  
A course record!  
  
   
**Mary:**   
I wonder what the trick is. I guess it's better to focus more on going down instead of up.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Next time, I'm going to put my weight towards the front during the descent!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh my. I cannot believe it... Although I do recall saying something similar before...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We should have realized it sooner.  
The most dangerous thing about cable cars is...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, cable cars...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are so fun to ride!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai. Thanks to that, Riders are running wild.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It looks like they're competing in a time attack.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not sure what it means for a time attack on cable cars...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But if they can do it, I suppose we cannot stop them.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You'll have to ask Scáthach how it works...!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Haha! Going too slow, you plain-Janes!  
Look at how fast I'm cruising along!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, that's not fair! You can't have Tarasque pull you! That's cheating!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Then what about Anne using her massive breasts as a weight? That's not fair either!  
  
   
**Mary:**   
We're both going up and down on this thing together!  
It's no different!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
If you're going to use Tarasque, then I'm going to use my magic to blow this entire car! How about that?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...What shall we do, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They'll come back when they get bored.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They'll come back when they get hungry.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All right...  
  
   
## Project 11: Let's Build a Garden  
   
**Mash:**   
Now that we have settled in quite nicely, some of us are thinking it's time to create a garden.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Enriching the soul is certainly important.  
I'd say that's a good idea.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Master, I'd prefer a conventional garden. Like one that's absolutely unremarkable, one you can find anywhere.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
What an unusual thing for you to say, Kiyohime. I was expecting you to have an idea that would be very you.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Like arranging the garden stones to read “MASTER LOVE.” Or like requesting a totem pole with Master's face from top to bottom.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Anything but that, please...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Speaking of stones and gardens in the garden, I heard there are Japanese rock gardens called “karesansui” in your country.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I know of them, but I've never seen one.  
So I'm pretty interested.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's unusual for you to make a request, Scáthach.  
Hmm... Karesansui... Interesting...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Er, I mean, I wasn't stating my support...  
I was just giving you my opinion.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Wait, how about a maze garden?  
We'll plant trees and lop off branches neatly.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
It'll appear the same no matter where you look.  
You can experience a very strange feeling there.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hmm. That sounds interesting, too.  
Oh, no, this is also just my opinion.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Anyway, we leave the decision to you, Master. Pick a garden that you think will be a relaxing place for everyone.  
  
  
## Project 11 Plan A: Let's Build an Ordinary Garden  
   
**Scáthach:**   
It's normal.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Completely normal.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
This totally typical garden! A garden that you could find in any ordinary backyard! This is wonderful!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wh-Why do you say that?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
My wild imagination... I mean, this is how I envision our future together!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(I knew it...)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
After working hard, Master manages to build an average house with an average backyard.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Money is tight, and work is hard, but we are happy. Because when you get home, your loving wife, ME, is waiting for you!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Ha, haha, hahaha...Oh, you mustn't do that, Master.  
If you keep gazing at the yard, I think my flames of jealousy will flare up.  
  
   
Master spending time every week tending to the garden, pulling weeds, touching it... I would be so jealous of that garden that I'd burn the whole thing down so there'd be   
   
no more weeds. But that's okay because your hands could tend to me from now on. Oh, you will be so nice. Ha ha.  
  
   
What should we name our second child?  
I'd want a girl&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is bad, Senpai.  
Kiyohime has gone off the deep end more than usual!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The “average backyard” is scary...  
  
   
## Project 11 Plan B: Let's Build a Zen Garden  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yes... This is good. It is.  
It has this indescribable charm to it.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You can't go in, Fou.  
You can sit on my lap.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's sit here on the veranda and watch together.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This must be... You are using sand and rocks to represent ripples on water. A water scene that does not use water. Very profound.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Yes, this Japanese sense of wabi-sabi... It's quite elegant. You see what isn't seen, and feel what isn't there.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
You could say this speaks to the very nature of valor itself. Don't you think, Scáthach?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Indeed. I was originally interested in this because I believed it could be useful in the spiritual and mental training for soldiers.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I should have had that idiot disciple look upon this for ten days as a test.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It does sound like you would be able to make out something.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think I'm going to need some eye drops.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, speaking of which, since we're taking a look at Japanese gardens, I've prepared some hot tea. Please have some.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Thank you very much. I shall have some.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
How thoughtful. Thank you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
For you too, Master.  
And I have some fresh cold water for Fou.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You take good care of me.  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm just happy to help Master out.  
Please do not think of it.  
  
   
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
... (Sip)  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
... (Sip)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
... (Sip)  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
...? Whoa! What the heck are you guys doing?  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
You're all sitting in silence looking at some weird rocks and slurping tea... Are you guys okay? You look like a bunch of old folks.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Did your legs all turn to stone or something?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Who are you calling old? You dumb disciple!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Uh, no, I wasn't really talking about you...  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Whoa!? Don't kick Gáe Bolg at me all of a sudden!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Good timing. It might not be too late.  
If you're able to see what isn't seen in this garden...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...you might be able to see how to kill me&ndash;she who cannot be killed. It is training time. Come.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
It's...so very elegant... (Sip)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-You...really think so?  
  
   
## Project 11 Plan C: Let's Build a Maze Garden  
   
**Marie:**   
Amazing! This is amazing, Master! Thank you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Surprisingly, this turned into quite the maze.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wherever you look every single hedge is trimmed perfectly. Scáthach's pruning technique is flawless.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You can really get lost in here.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Then go and get lost.  
That's what's so fun about mazes.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I mean, entering a maze and not getting lost?  
How boring! That's why...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Hehe. You're not allowed to walk ahead.  
You might find the exit by smell. I'll hold you!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
～♪  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do you like mazes?  
   
**Marie:**   
Yes, I do. A lot!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're in a good mood, Princess.  
   
**Marie:**   
Hehe. “But of course”... is what I should say, I guess?  
Not a single objection, that is!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is there a reason you like mazes?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Hmm? Well... It's difficult to answer when you put it that way. There was always one where I lived, after all.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
There was one at Versailles, and at Schönbrunn in Austria. Oh, that's the palace I was living at when I first met Amadeus.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
But the one at Versailles isn't there anymore.  
I liked it, but my husband...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Yes. Perhaps that is the reason.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
When I became the queen, and entered into the royal family, I wasn't allowed to lose my way any longer.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
What I needed to do had been predetermined, and things I couldn't do were also decided for me. I went through a lot.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
But in a maze, you're allowed to not know where to go. Like a child, you get lost, and just simply search for the exit.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
So perhaps that ended up being a way to relieve stress for me? I'm not sure, though.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can't say for certain, but... I do think I understand.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All right! Let's try and get lost, then!  
   
**Mash:**   
I think you don't have to try getting lost.  
But yes, let's have fun.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okay. In any case... let's go this way!  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, we just came from this direction!  
  
   
  
   
**Fou:**   
F-Fou...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Fou's making a face like, “Why can't you dumb humans smell your way out of this maze!?”  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Okay, we can't lose to Fou! Let's find our way out!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
But if it's dinnertime and we still can't find our way out, let's have Fou help us.  
  
   
## Project 12: Let's Build a Playground  
   
**Marie:**   
I wish we had a little more space to play.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A space to play?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Yes. I know that everyone goes for a dip in the sea when they're not busy collecting resources...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
But even that's getting boring. It'd be nice to have somewhere to stretch our legs and have some fun.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Hmm, I understand. It sounds good to me. Sports have a positive impact on both your mind and body.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I have some experience in sports. If an athletic field were available, I could challenge Master and the others.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
A place where we can have fun while exercising? I get it. I'm positive what you want is a colosseum.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm positive that's not what she meant!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Such absurd words, yet such a straight face...!?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Why? To us warriors, fighting a tough enemy is the best form of entertainment. Right, Martha?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
What? I-Is that so? I'm sorry, but I don't really understand that feeling...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Not a very convincing reply when you're standing there polishing your gauntlets...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
As for me, I believe we should build Marie Land!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
U-Uh, what exactly is that?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Marie Land is Marie Land.  
It'll be so much fun!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not really sure, but at least she seems to be confident about it. What should we do, Senpai?  
  
  
## Project 12 Plan A: Let's Build an Athletic Field  
   
**Altria:**   
This is quite the athletic field.  
Thank you, Master.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou is running around a lot, too.  
He seems to like it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So...how about we play some baseball?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So...how about we play some soccer?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't think we have enough people, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
However, we do have this ball that Scáthach made for us.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Given the ball's size, I think it's just right for a game like futsal.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Sounds good. I shall give you a handicap. The teams will be me by myself against Master Fujimaru, Mash, and Fou.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
3 on 1? That overconfidence will lead to your defeat!  
   
**Altria:**   
Hahaha. Or will it?  
We won't know unless we try.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't go too hard on us.  
   
**Altria:**   
That is nonsense. One must always give their best in sports. It is all about both sides fighting to the death!  
  
   
  
   
**Altria:**   
Ha! Right here!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fu-ou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou's animal dribble isn't working!  
She intercepted the ball... Ugh!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Those are some good moves...but not good enough, Mash! Now the only one left is Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Argh! I can't keep up!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Heh heh, I see that you are lacking in training.  
And... shoot!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Phew. You're good with the ball, Altria.  
Have you always liked futsal?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
No, I must have practiced this somewhere before. Yes...though I don't remember much about it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Those moves... With such a vague skill explanation...  
Very impressive.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, by the way...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mordred is over there throwing a ball against the wall all alone and glancing over at us...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Oh, that's just your standard kid hoping to make it into the major leagues someday.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Clearly, the child wants to practice alone in stoic silence.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
(Damn it. What should I say? “Let me play, too”?  
“I want in”? Which one?)  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
(“Bring it on, King Arthur!” Yeah, that sounds more like me... Ugggghhh.)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can I call for some reinforcements?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think four versus one would be just right.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Well...if that is what you want, Master.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In that case, Mordred!  
Could you help us out?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
!?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I-I guess I have no choice! If you need help that much,  
I don't mind giving you a hand!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Sir Mordred, there is no need to hold back.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Of course, Fa... King Arthur!  
I'm gonna pulverize you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Isn't it nice, Senpai...playing sports...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
## Project 12 Plan B: Let's Build a Colosseum  
   
**Martha:**   
Sei! Ha!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Well, well, so this is the combat technique that is passed down to saints. I hear it even works on angels... Truly intriguing.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Damn! They're having all the fun...  
When's it gonna be my turn?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hurry up and switch out! Get knocked out!  
Or kick her ass!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh my. We really built a colosseum...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They look like they're having fun, anyway...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hmm... We may have gone too far.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
We heard about the tournament to choose Master's number one Servant!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
We may have come a bit late, but here we are!  
Now, into the fray! Hold her steady!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Did you just say...we were picking Master's number one...Master's true wife?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Their enthusiasm is growing far more than I expected! Even if they're getting fired up in a direction they shouldn't!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
As long as everyone's having fun, I guess...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
As long as no one gets hurt...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(The light of hope has gone out of Senpai's eyes!)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Here, Senpai.  
Please hold Fou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Stroking his soft hair may at least ease your pain a little...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
## Project 12 Plan C: Let's Build Marie Land  
   
**Marie:**   
Look at all this! It looks incredibly fun!  
This really makes me so happy. Thank you, Master!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We built everything according to your blueprints, Marie... They were certainly quite extensive.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A seesaw, a jungle gym, monkey bars, and a swing. There's even an elephant-shaped slide, and many other things...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This tile mosaic... Is it an artistic interpretation of you, Marie?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
A dream park designed by me, produced by me, to be enjoyed to the fullest by me! That's what Marie Land is all about!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Now then, Master, Mash, and everyone else!  
This is Marie Land's grand opening! Let's go have fun!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou is already having a great time, jumping and climbing around those buried tires!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
As for us...ah, yes.  
Let's start off on the swings, shall we?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you having fun, Mash?  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, this is a fun, new experience. How can a contraption with simple back and forth movements be so fun? How mystifying.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you having fun, Marie?  
   
**Marie:**   
Yes, of course!  
Look, look! How high do you think I can swing?  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
But according to some sources, many of these types of parks have been torn down in recent years.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
But they're so much fun. Why?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Probably for the safety of the children. I understand that it's better to prevent accidents before they happen.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
But there are no children here, and we're on a desert island. We've got nothing to worry about.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Although some people are playing in ways children shouldn't see...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yes... This is good for training the inner ear. Now, if I shower them with arrows at the same time... Hmm.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As you can see, Scáthach is standing atop the fast-spinning merry-go-round...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I wonder how you use this... Oh, I see! Like this!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And there's Martha, performing low kicks over and over on the half-buried tire intended for leapfrog...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This would set a bad example for the children...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh, there are some rare faces here too, though?  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Karna seems to just be standing atop the elephant slide.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
I don't know why, but it is calming up here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As a Heroic Spirit from India, he's probably ridden an elephant before. Maybe he feels nostalgic...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As for whether it suits him... No comment.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
 It's good that everyone is having fun in their own way.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Yes, yes, that's precisely right, Master! That's why I had lots of different pieces of playground equipment made!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Come on, let's try something else now!  
We're going to play until the sun sets!  
  
   
## Project 13: Let's Build an Observation Deck  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Now that the development of the island has progressed quite nicely...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I would like to propose that we build a lookout from which we can gaze over the whole island☆  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Looking down on the island from high up... The cool breeze blowing... My mind filled with precious memories of the person standing next to me... Awww.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
It will be a romantic building that will surely make you blush. Don't you think so too, Master?  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hm. Romantic or not, it could serve many purposes. Building a tower of some sort is a nice idea.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
The question is what material to use.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Yes! I'll go first. I believe a five-story pagoda, lavishly made of the best-quality wood, would be the most appropriate thing to build!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Its color, its beautiful shape, the seemingly&ndash;no, literallypointless number of roofs... It's the epitome of Japanese high society.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Wait a minute. We are building the first tower for this island, right? If so, then a lighthouse is the only way to go.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
I agree. We should think about what our priorities are, Master.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
A tower, eh? The ideas you guys come up with are always lame.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Here, I'll design it for you... (Rustle, rustle)  
How about this!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you for the sketch... Oh my. This is...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, I mean... I'm sure some people think stuff like this is attractive, but why, of all things, would you choose it over   
   
**Mordred:**   
Hehe, if we're talking surfers, then it's all about rock 'n' roll! Don't you think this tower rocks?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, we need your help!  
  
  
## Project 13 Plan A: Let's Build a Lighthouse  
   
**Anne:**   
This is an impressive lighthouse.  
Thank you very much, Master!  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Ah yes, this puts me at ease.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It doesn't have any special ornamentation, but it looks the way a lighthouse should. They look very pleased with it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
For security purposes?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe they have a fetish for lighthouses?  
   
**Mash:**   
No, Senpai.  
In my opinion, it was probably a practical request.  
  
   
  
   
**Anne:**   
That's true. To pirates, lighthouses are invaluable guideposts. We would never take them for granted.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
In fact, there are some pirates who even treated them as sacred. You could say they loved them as they might women.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
There's nothing like arriving at your destination after a perilous voyage...seeing the light of a lighthouse...and making disgusting jokes about it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What? What jokes?  
  
   
**Mary:**   
Oh, come on.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
You're quite a mean one, aren't you, Master?  
  
   
**Anne:**   
I mean, we're pirates, so we're fine with that sort of thing, but an innocent girl like Mash would feel a tad uncomfortable hearing a joke like this.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Why don't we hold off on that answer for another time?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-Alright. Thank you for keeping me in mind.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
In any case, now we can have some peace of mind whenever we want to head out to sea.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Right. Speaking of which, Master?  
  
   
**Anne:**   
If you decide you want to sail off as a pirate, go ahead and command us anytime.  
  
   
**Anne:**   
Now that this lighthouse can clearly illuminate our way back, we'll happily sail the seas with you whenever you wish♪  
  
   
## Project 13 Plan B: Let's Build a Pagoda  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Mikon! Just look at this splendid five-storied pagoda towering over this desert island! It defies explanation! And that's the best part!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Thank you very much, Master.  
What made you decide on this?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? I just sort of picked...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I wanted to see your smile, Tamamo.  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
D-Don't say things like that with a perfectly straight face!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
If you act like that, Master...I have no choice but to stay by your side...or rather, I want you to say more...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
A-Anyway!  
  
   
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
If that's true, then you didn't have any particular interest in pagodas?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Since we're on the subject, if you have any questions,  
I can answer them.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What are those halo-looking decorations at the top?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh? So that's where your eye goes first, I see!  
You have a good eye!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
That entire ornamental piece is called the pagoda's finial. Each part has a meaning, but I'll skip over them for now.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Those nine rings in the middle are called the  
“kurin (nine rings)” or “hourin (treasure rings).”  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
They represent the Five Wisdom Buddhas and the Four Bodhisattvas.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Which of course includes Vairocana...  
That is to say, Amaterasu!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
The fact that that was what caught your interest first, Master, is proof that you are concerned about me above all things!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Hmm, we really do have extraordinary compatibility!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I...I see...?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
In other words, one could say this pagoda is like a dedication of faith to me. Though it's a rather roundabout one.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I like it even more when I think about it that way!  
It was worth the effort of having it made for me!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
So from now on, think of this pagoda as if it were me, and treat it with care, Master!  
  
   
## Project 13 Plan C: Let's Build a Rock Tower  
   
**Mordred:**   
T-That's so freaking cool!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, man. I think I might've made something insanely awesome!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Not only do I have aptitude as a king, but as an artist too! Man, I really am the best! I'm awesome!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Such passionate self-praise.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We built it exactly according to Mordred's design...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It is meant to be in the style of the Tower of Babel.  
I'm not sure why it purposefully looks like it's broken partway up?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It...It's so freaking cool!  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh-ho! I knew you'd get it, Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well, rock on dude...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh-ho! Right? Right?  
  
   
  
   
**Mordred:**   
You can clearly see it overflows with rebellious spirit!  
It's the perfect symbol of mankind's mutinous heart!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
This is a tower truly fit for me!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Well, I don't want to use such a clichéd phrase, but this must be what they call “edgy”...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Wha-What!? Th-This tower! It is blasphemous!  
Most blasphemous!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Hmm? But... I suppose it's acceptable if it is meant to represent an act of divine will...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
U-Um, Martha...I think it's safe to say there's not even a smidge of a connection to anything pious here... So don't bother trying to find one...  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
(Hmm... Although it was my first time building a tower that can withstand actual use while appearing broken...)  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
(...Since it hasn't crumbled yet,  
it seems it turned out well.)  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
(I'm quite a good craftsman, if I do say so myself.  
Heh, heh...)  
  
   
## Project 14: Let's Build a Big House  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I think we should upgrade our house!  
Like, BIG!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I think so, too Like, mikooon!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I do agree that our stronghold shouldn't stay the same when the island has been through so much expansion.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Naturally, we suggest building a Japanese-style samurai residence! With a big garden. And a storehouse.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
A big house, you say?  
That can only mean a castle.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
I agree. A castle is the only dwelling place fit for a king. There's no doubt about it.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Mmm... As a good wife and maiden fox that all of Japan is proud of, I'd recommend a mansion...  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
But as a summer socialite, a castle sounds nice too.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Do you remember when we were building our first house? My opinion still hasn't changed.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
All that matters is protection. A big house?  
That means it'll have to be a big fortress!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Sure. I see...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
And maybe we could make it a flying one, too?  
  
  
## Project 14 Plan A: Let's Build a Samurai Residence  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
My, my, what a splendid samurai residence!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Building such a thing for me...I am just so grateful, Master. This must truly be love.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It certainly looks like it would be a very nice living space. Shall we all go in and take a look around?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes, let's start with the courtyard!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foo-u!  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Hmm... This place has a nostalgic feel to it, somehow. Soothing, you might say...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Is this the storehouse? I see...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
If we fill it with broken junk like a storage shed, it would definitely be even more soothing. Yes.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Let us head inside.  
What a spacious kitchen and living room.  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
The decor's pretty elaborate. Hm? For some reason it feels like a good place to ready my spear.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You may raise your spear, but if you start swinging it around and rip my shoji screens, I will burn you to death without hesitation.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
We've just about seen everything now.  
So finally, will you come this way with me, Master?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
This is a private area, so everyone else can continue wandering the grounds as you like.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I must prepare a bit, so if you will allow me to enter the room by myself first...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Please come in after five minutes, Master.  
Now then...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is it time yet? I'm coming in.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's been five minutes, but...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou-ou.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is this...a bedroom? And right in the middle of it is...  
  
   
**Futon:**   
(Wriggle, wriggle)  
  
   
**Futon:**   
This is your room, Master. Since it's a very important place, I thought you should take a test nap.  
  
   
**Futon:**   
I've laid out your futon, so please feel free to test its comfort to your heart's content. Go right ahead.  
  
   
**Futon:**   
Oh, where am I? Hehe. Don't worry about that.  
Go on...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think Fou can take the first nap...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Put Fou inside the covers.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Offer Fou up as a sacrifice.  
  
   
**Futon:**   
Squee! Master! Master! The time has finally come for you to accept my love, Master! Ooohh!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou!?  
  
   
**Futon:**   
Ahhhh, Master! You're hairier than I'd imagined...Oh, ho, ho... But I love that untamed side of you, too!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Take your time...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooooou!  
  
   
## Project 14 Plan B: Let's Build a Castle  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh, my! What a lovely, cozy castle this is, Master Thank you!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
As the summertime celebrity fox, I hereby declare myself quite suited to castle life! It brings out my noble aura!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Yes, it's so fitting that it wouldn't be strange to have a portrait of me hanging on the walls.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Huh? Inari god statues? Hmmm, well if they're put in place as gargoyles, I suppose it would be fine.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
True, this castle is small, but it should be enough for this island. I believe it is a good castle, Master.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
The only thing that perturbs me is that this place might have Heracles lurking about.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's such a gorgeous castle, yet Marie and Altria seem right at home.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Well, I was a king, after all.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Any castle would appear small by comparison with Versailles or Schönbrunn. Those were royal palaces, after all.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
But the fact that this castle is small is part of its charm. How can I put it? It's...homey?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Why, in Versailles, it felt like I was always crossing paths with total strangers.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
My experience is basically just with Japanese palaces, but I've had that experience too.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
The bigger the castle, the more people you need to maintain it.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
It becomes less “a home” than “a place filled with many people.”  
  
   
**Altria:**   
True. In a smaller castle on a small stretch of land, the bonds of the people gathered get stronger.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Wouldn't it be nice if we became like that?  
  
   
**Altria:**   
Indeed, Master. You are the king of this castle, and we are your knights.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Or rather, you are the king here, and I am your queen...perhaps?  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
And I, of course, am your ever helpful ideal wife shrine maiden fox!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
The kind who stands behind her king with a mysterious smile, but will cast a deadly curse upon enemies when needed.  
  
   
**Altria:**   
As one who will share this abode with you, I pray for our unity to be like a family...  
  
   
**Altria:**   
And that we shall all have prosperity as small but certain as this castle.  
  
   
## Project 14 Plan C: Let's Build an Iron Fortress  
   
**Mordred:**   
Whoa! Awesome!  
Now that's what I call a perfect fortress!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Iron plating...spiked fences...a watch tower...  
It certainly seems to have impressive security.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
As the designer, if I say so myself, I never dreamed it could be built so exactly the way I imagined it!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
It's too bad we couldn't get it to fly, though!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Oh... She has that expression that says,  
“even I have my limits!”)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So how about you show us around?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's cool! Let's explore inside!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Heh, heh. You bet! Follow me!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
There are tons of cool features inside, too.  
For example, when you flip this switch&ndash;  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
What the...!?  
A humongous iron sphere blocking the corridor?!  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Hey! It's rolling towards&ndash;  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
And if someone steps into that room, take this!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A ceiling trap!  
  
   
**Karna:**   
... (I managed to prop the ceiling up with my spear&ndash;but now I can't move.)  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Good grief, it's dangerous to aimlessly walk around here. Shall we sit here a moment and rest&ndash;  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
And this button opens the trapdoor in the floor.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Whaaaaaaat?!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
W-What an appalling fortress. You seem to have quite a variety of security systems built into the place.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
H-How reassuring...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Right? You know what they say: “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
But, you know...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe you went a little overboard?  
   
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey. Lemme ask you something.  
Do you know why I'm so hung up on strong defenses?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
It's because I've gotta protect you, at all costs.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mordred...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
The island's pretty developed now, but we can't let our guard down. This place is huge. There may be enemies here that we don't know about yet.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
And in war, if you lose your leader, you're more or less done for. You can't ever recover from that.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
That's why, see? How do I put this...?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Unlike me, you're kind of a weakling.  
And if you got killed, it would be over for all of us.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes...indeed! I agree, Mordred!  
Keeping Master alive should be our top priority.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I feel the same way as you do. Until we can leave this island, we don't know what might happen. We mustn't lower our guard until the very end.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's use this impenetrable fortress to establish an unsurpassed level of security!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Heh, heh! Well, either way you don't have to worry about enemies with invincible me here, but whatever.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah! Fou's fur feels quite damp.  
A considerable amount of heat is building up here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, Mordred.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Does this fortress have an air-conditioning system?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hm? 'Course not.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
“No enemy shall ever enter! Whoever does will never leave here alive!” That's my concept, see? Can't beat 'em with AC.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, but what about the living conditions for Senpai and the others?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Okay, to the beach! Let's go to the beach! If you get hot, just ride the waves! That should solve everything!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why does it feel like the topic got drastically changed?  
   
**Mordred:**   
Don't sweat the small stuff! All you've gotta do is put your faith in me and the waves!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
C'mon, let's go!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okay, let's just forget everything and go to the beach!  
   
**Mordred:**   
Right on! That's the way you've gotta roll, Master!  
  
   
  
   
## Project 15 Plan A: Let's Make a Statue of Mordred  
   
**Mordred:**   
I really don't say stuff like this often, so be grateful.  
Just this once, I'm gonna go outta my way to say this.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
You really did it, Master.  
I take my hat off to you.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
This is proof that you've completed development of this island. The final monument...a statue of me!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Man! This is so freaking cool!  
It's really got a regal look to it, right?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yep, yep.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...  
   
**Mordred:**   
It leaves you speechless, huh? That's okay, I can tell how you feel just from your eyes, Master.  
  
   
  
   
**Mordred:**   
A lot's happened since we reached this island, but I feel a sense of accomplishment when I look up at this thing.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
All right, Master. Both me and this big version of me are watching you.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
So let's use this momentum to finish building our escape ship!  
  
   
## Project 15 Plan B: Let's Make a Statue of Tamamo  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I will not say much, Master.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Because no words... Not even by using my ears and tail could I completely express my feelings.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
But, even so, allow me to say one thing.  
Just one obvious thing.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Thank you very much, Master.  
Tamamo is truly fortunate.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm glad it made you happy.  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Yes, of course! My tail and ears and have been quivering in delight this entire time!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It looks like it gives good luck.  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Ohh, this could compete with even the likes of the Fushimi Inari Shrine or the Ise Shrine.  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
This statue is a direct reflection of your feelings for me, Master!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
That being the case, I feel I should bless you directly in return! I have always done so, but now even more so!  
  
   
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I have nothing to hold back!  
All of my energies and my attention are laser-focused!  
  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Feel the loving blessing from this Tamamo Statue, Master! And with that, let us finish the construction of our escape ship!  
  
   
## Project 15 Plan C: Let's Make a Statue of Marie  
   
**Marie:**   
Ohhh, this is quite moving.  
There are no large statues of me like this even in France.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Well, it's only natural. After all, I was only a queen.  
I was not a hero or anything of the sort.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
And yet, here on this island, you have chosen to build this statue of me. A statue of me, who was a nobody!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
A statue that reminds me that I was only a girl, only a queen, and yet affirms me...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
“You were fine just that way.” That's what this statue seems to say to me. That's how I feel.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Which is why I want to thank you, Master.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Though it hasn't been entirely easy along the way, I am glad that I was able to come to this island with you.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's been more fun than I expected.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We made a lot of memories here.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Yes, indeed. A lovely summer vacation that arrived unexpectedly.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
But I suppose this summer cannot last forever.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Because if things were always like this, we couldn't call it a vacation anymore.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Master. Now that this statue has made our mark upon this island, proving that we were here...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Let us put our best efforts into building a wonderful escape ship!
