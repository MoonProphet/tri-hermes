# The Garden of Sinners/The Garden of Order  
  
## Prologue  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Another strange dream, Mash.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...It's a really warm dream, Fou.  
  
---  
  
**F：???:**  
Oh my. For a guest to arrive here... Is this some kind of mistake?  
  
**F：???:**  
If you're dreaming, go back to where you came from.  
  
**F：???:**  
This is a place without boundaries.  
You have a name, so you shouldn't be here.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, I woke up here...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I didn't come here because I wanted to...  
  
---  
  
**F：???:**  
You didn't want to be here?  
In that case... Hehe, sorry.  
  
**F：???:**  
Looks like our connection was made from this side. Let me apologize while I can, Fujimaru.  
  
**F：???:**  
I'm asleep and thus unaware of what's going on outside. But I can take a guess.  
  
**F：???:**  
I'm sure it's just another hack-and-slash type of case without a hint of romance.  
  
**F：???:**  
What a disaster, busy Master. But it's a good thing to have things you can do, things you must do.  
  
**F：???:**  
...Yes, rather than talk about myself, I would love to talk more about your future, but...  
  
**F：???:**  
Too bad, the night is almost over. Seems like this dream is about to end.  
  
**F：???:**  
If we meet again, could you please call me by my name?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hi, I know it's only midnight, but good morning, Fujimaru. Sorry to wake you up.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
However, it's an emergency, so I contacted you anyway. I'm sorry, but please come to the Command Room immediately.  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai!  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou, Foou!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good evening, Mash.  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes, good evening, Senpai. This will be a night shift, so thank you for all your hard work.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Good morning, Mash.  
  
**Mash:**   
Good morning... Meaning, you were already sleeping, Senpai?  
  
**Mash:**   
I think it's good to sleep early. It means you're someone with dreams and hopes.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Oops, now is not the time for greetings.  
  
**Mash:**   
Doctor Roman requested an urgent dispatch.  
Hurry to the Command Room, Master!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Right, let's get going!  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Hey, isn't it kind of quiet?  
  
**Mash:**   
Now that you mention it...  
Chaldea does feel kind of empty...  
  
**Mash:**   
Usually, you'll see a lot of non-assigned Servants strolling through these hallways...  
  
**Mash:**   
But tonight of all nights, we didn't run into anyone...  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah, both of you are here.  
That saves me time in explaining.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Now, then, please look at the monitor. Around Japan on the world map.  
  
**Mash:**   
Is it Singularity F? I thought we already recovered the Holy Grail at those coordinates.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Not Fuyuki, but next to it. You can see a strange distortion, right?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's been under observation for several days.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
At first, I thought it was a small error caused by the fluctuation of Singularity F's repair.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
But it wouldn't disappear even after a considerate amount of time. Then I tried changing Sheba's observation angle...  
  
**Mash:**   
There are signs of life!  
But these coordinates should have been incinerated!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, and that's not all.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
I only detected a few life forms,  
but I picked up countless moving objects.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
On top of that, no matter how much I adjust Sheba, I can't get a read on the scale and era of these coordinates.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's a complete black box. We won't know what's going on unless we Rayshift there.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So, is it a new Singularity?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm sorry, but I can't even be sure about that. Humanity has been destroyed, and the outside world incinerated.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
At least before 2018, when humans were still alive.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
The cause of such atrocities, what made them possible, was our loss of coordinates called the Foundations of Humanity&mdash;  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Historical events that became the essential support pillars of our human history...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
...such as those that occurred in France and Rome.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
In response, Chaldea prevented the collapse of these foundations by Rayshifting into them from outside the time flow.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even if it's already incinerated in the proper timeline, Chaldea can Rayshift to a time before the destruction, and prevent its collapse.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru, just think of what you've been doing as repairing a completely incinerated scroll.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
However, these coordinates are different.  
They don't exist in any history.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Think of it as something that's lost. A hole eaten away by bugs.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
As usual, right?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, simply put, that's exactly it!  
You're really reliable, Fujimaru!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
I was ready to explain a lot of things,  
but in short, you should take a chance on everything!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
...Hmm, Doctor. I request further explanation on what you just said.  
  
**Mash:**   
There are few signs of life, but multiple moving objects. What does that mean?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Let me explain it! Even if it's the night shift, I can still give you a lecture with my glamorous beauty!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Who am I? I am the lady who loves those green cubes, everybody's favorite shop owner, Da Vinci!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good evening. It's a nice night out.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
It's the perfect night for a ghost story. Not that any of them happened at Chaldea.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you kidding me with Mona Lisa?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, stop throwing silver embers at me! It's my bad! I was just having a little bit of fun!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...But that Craft Essence was pretty well made, right? My only regret is that I couldn't write the explanation in mirrored letters.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Good evening, Da Vinci. Please give us your explanation.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
They are not alive, yet they are moving around... In other words, that place is full of zombies.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, it's not like you will be surprised by them. Zombies were in France, too.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
But there's another problem, Fujimaru.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
If the seven Singularities are like stains on the scroll we call human history, that fake Singularity is like a hole in that scroll.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I don't understand how it happened, but it's luring the Servants and trapping them in there.  
  
**Mash:**   
Trapping the Servants?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Speaking of which, did you notice that Chaldea is a lot more quiet than usual?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Servants that Fujimaru successfully summoned and formed a contract with...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
They're receiving magical energy from Chaldea and setting up anchors for their existence all around this base.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
You can call it a temporary incarnation.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
If they keep using magical energy from their  
Master each time they're summoned into battle, Fujimaru would be all dried up already.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
So, in order to lessen the burden cast on Fujimaru,  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Chaldea is using 40% of its power to sustain the contract with each Servant.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
As long as Grand Order is still in effect, these Servants have made Chaldea their home.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I didn't know...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I had a vague idea...  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Yes, yes. Oh, just so you know, I'm different. Even if Chaldea's light has gone out, I can still sustain my body.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ahem!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
About those Servants. A few of them disappeared when this distortion was observed.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
They all headed to this distortion of their own free will... And then they never came back.  
  
**Mash:**   
Never came back... So they weren't eliminated? That means...they stayed there?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Exactly. Their contracts with Fujimaru are still intact.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
The Heroic Spirits who Rayshifted to that strange hole are either staying there of their own free will, or&mdash;  
  
**Mash:**   
It's possible that they're trapped and can't come back.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's everything. This distortion has nothing to do with the Foundation of Humanity.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
It wouldn't cause any harm even if left as it is... However, it's also true the Servants are not coming back.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru. Mash.  
I want you to investigate these coordinates.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Rayshifting anywhere other than a Singularity is an exception, and requires the authorization of the former Director, but...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Will you do it?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course, Doctor.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If they are taken, we'll get them back!  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Thank you. You're so reliable!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Then we will commence Rayshifting now.  
You two, start your preparations.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
We don't know what might happen there.  
And we won't be able to send backup.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Please, be careful over there. Oh, and one more thing... This is just a hunch, but...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Perhaps Fujimaru will find the scenery over there very familiar.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
If that's the case, please show Mash around. She's never seen anything like that.  
  
**Mash:**   
?  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't really get it, but roger!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Familiar scenery?  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
You'll understand when you get there.  
Well then, commencing Rayshift!  
  
## Encounter  
  
**Mash:**   
A road made of asphalt...  
High-rises like big walls...  
  
**Mash:**   
This is...  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm sure of it! This is the 21st-century Japan, Senpai!  
  
**Mash:**   
Look! See? A vending machine that isn't destroyed!  
  
**Mash:**   
Even a public phone, and a bus stop, too!  
Ah, and that thing like a house is a toilet!  
  
**Mash:**   
The city seems so quiet and the streets are so clean! The example of a perfectly safe city!  
  
**Mash:**   
Unfortunately, I don't see any of those so-called convenience stores&ndash; The places that never sleep!  
  
**Mash:**   
It really is just like what I've read...  
One of my dreams has come true!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It was your dream?  
  
**Mash:**   
Ah... Yes. I'm sorry, I got carried away. It's not that I dreamed of visiting a city in Japan.  
  
**Mash:**   
Not only Tokyo, but Washington, Moscow, Beijing, Rome, Madrid...  
  
**Mash:**   
Any one of them would have been fine. I just wanted to visit a major city from the era I live in.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It seems pretty normal...  
  
**Mash:**   
Ugh. It's almost like you're saying, “What's so special about a city like this?”  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai, did you live in a city like this one? No, I am sure you did.  
  
**Mash:**   
Please tell me more about it, in detail! Everything from your life in elementary school to high school! Please!  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hello, test, test.  
Communication, video feed, both working fine.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah, as I thought... Judging from these coordinates and time, I predicted your destination to be a city in Japan.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
But... I didn't expect it to be such an urban area. This seems pretty fishy to me...  
  
**Mash:**   
...You're right. A normal city in a time like this is the most abnormal thing.  
  
**Mash:**   
The only two normal life-form responses are from Senpai and myself... But I'm also getting some higher-class life-form responses from that building.  
  
**Mash:**   
&mdash;A big city like this, with this many houses, and still no one in sight.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Building? Oh, that cylindrical one? It sure looks weird...  
Fujimaru, can you tell us anything about it?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's like a spooky tower.  
  
**Mash:**   
...I agree.  
I'm getting chills just looking at it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's just an apartment.  
  
**Mash:**   
Just an apartment? But its design is so different than the other buildings surrounding it...  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyway, that building is undeniably suspicious. I'm picking up readings of multiple Servants inside as well.  
  
**Mash:**   
No obstacles detected from here to the building entrance. Let's go there and... Wait! Senpai!  
  
**Mash:**   
There's someone around the entrance! It's&mdash;  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm picking up multiple strange signals! Residual wills... They're ghosts!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Looks like a Servant is fighting with them!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hurry up, Mash!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait! I'm not picking up any more ghost readings! They didn't disperse, they disappeared&mdash;  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
As if they were erased with an eraser!  
That's a little scary, isn't it!? What is it!?  
  
**Mash:**   
Servant response, entering our line of sight! Is that&mdash;a woman?  
  
**D：???:**  
...Phew, cheap dream.  
Its quality is too low to be a nightmare.  
  
**D：???:**  
Ghosts with skulls as faces? Man, they gotta get with the times.  
  
**Mash:**   
It's a girl...in a kimono...holding a knife!  
Senpai, who is she?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't know her.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's the first time I've ever seen her face.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
...Just as I thought  
Let's try to talk to her first...  
  
**D：???:**  
No need. I don't want to talk to you. It'll take too long.  
  
**D：???:**  
Doesn't matter if you're good or bad. With this knife in your head, you can say goodbye to this reality.  
  
**D：???:**  
You're the one who stuck your nose in other people's business, yeah? I am gonna send that nose, along with your head, to where they belong!  
  
**Mash:**   
...Here she comes!  
I don't get it, but it's a battle, Master!  
  
**--BATTLE-**  
  
**Mash:**   
Battle was interrupted, but...we still don't know that Servant's real name, nor its attack pattern!  
  
**Mash:**   
Doctor, please give us your analysis!  
  
**Mash:**   
How can a simple knife cut not only a Servant's body, but easily cut its armor too?!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
...It's Mystic Eyes. I can't believe Mystic Eyes of this level still exist in the modern era.  
  
**Mash:**   
Doctor?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
In the world of Magecraft, magical eyes that can perceive all things mystical are called Mystic Eyes.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
These eyes can project phenomena without casting any sorts of chants or rituals. They just need to look.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
The most popular types are “Binding,” “Compulsion,” “Contract,” “Flame,” “Illusion,” and “Jinx.”  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even among them, her eyes are special. The type that can “Stop” everything, it's even more powerful than “Petrification.”  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Her rainbow eyes materialize the concept of death and capture it. If I had to give them a name, I'd call them the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
How incredible! That's an ability fit for a Divine Spirit! To kill an enemy just by looking at them... Talk about overpowered!  
  
**D：???:**  
...What's up with him?  
He sounded so fake and unimportant...  
  
**D：???:**  
I'm not a Heroic Spirit.  
I can't kill anyone just by looking at them.  
  
**D：???:**  
All I can do is see death... Lines that trace death. Ummm, like the eventual end of all things.  
  
**D：???:**  
Would you understand if I say I simply trace the cause, the result of eventual death?  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh, um, I see... The, uh, lines that trace death... The, the eventual end of all things... Y-Yes...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm sorry, I don't get it at all.  
  
**Mash:**   
...Me neither. It seems to be a highly advanced magical theory, but...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So you slash a person's life span?  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai, you understand?!  
  
**D：???:**  
Huh, that was easy. Hey, you must be a big otaku, right? Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Nice, Fujimaru! She looks happy! Really happy!)  
  
---  
  
**D：???:**  
Whatever. Hey, you there! The slippery-looking one!  
  
**Mash:**   
M-Me?!  
  
**D：???:**  
Of course! Who else could it be? Physically, you're not a complete Servant, right?  
  
**Mash:**   
R-Right. I'm a Demi-Servant,  
so you could say that my base body is human...  
  
**D：???:**  
I see. I thought you were that shadowy bastard's friend.  
  
**D：???:**  
That [♂ man /♀️ woman]'s eyes are glittering. I guess that rules out the possibility of being possessed by some weird illusions.  
  
**D：???:**  
My bad for attacking you. All right, see ya.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What? Hold on!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where do you think you're going?!  
  
---  
  
**D：???:**  
I am going to tear down this apartment. I can't just leave it like that.  
  
**D：???:**  
It's crawling with disgusting things inside. If I let it be, it's gonna cause trouble for the neighbors.  
  
**D：???:**  
Say, do you guys watch horror movies?  
You do? Good.  
  
**D：???:**  
You know the deal... Things like walking corpses, ghosts you aren't supposed to see...  
  
**D：???:**  
Things like that are running rampant in there... All because of Servants.  
  
**Mash:**   
All because of...Servants?  
  
**D：???:**  
Yeah. Servants live in that apartment like it's their own. Thanks to them, it's all becoming one big block party.  
  
**D：???:**  
I mean, Servants are kinda like ghosts, right? If they gain physical bodies, others will get carried away too.  
  
**D：???:**  
...Well, as for myself, I am also showing up as a Servant.  
  
**D：???:**  
If you're a Demi-Servant, I guess that makes me a Pseudo-Servant.  
  
**D：???:**  
Most likely I had a connection with this building, so I ended up being summoned. It's really annoying.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
If you're a Servant, you need a Master...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Will you be okay by yourself?  
  
---  
  
**D：???:**  
Who cares? If I vanish, it actually saves me some trouble. At least I don't have to go through this ordeal.  
  
**Mash:**   
I don't know if you're being frank, or you just don't care about yourself...  
  
**Mash:**   
Still, though...  
There must be a reason why we met here!  
  
**Mash:**   
If you don't have a Master, could you work with Chaldea?  
  
**D：???:**  
...A reason, you say.  
This, too, must be my fate... I don't hate it.  
  
**D：???:**  
That one over there is a Master, right? If I help you, that would really make me look like a Servant.  
  
**D：???:**  
I'm merely an outsider who was summoned here. I don't intend on concerning myself with others.  
  
**D：???:**  
However, I want to pay back that despicable shadowy bastard...  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou!  
  
**D：???:**  
!  
  
**Mash:**   
Fou!? Were you hiding in my shield again?  
  
**D：???:**  
...Are you kidding me? What is this furball?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You never know when Fou will show up...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Fou is everyone's favorite Runner!  
  
---  
  
**D：???:**  
...Ryougi Shiki.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What?  
  
---  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
That is my name.  
What's your name?  
  
**Mash:**   
Right, this is Master Fujimaru.  
My name is Mash Kyrielight.  
  
**Mash:**   
If we're exchanging our names like this... Does that mean you'll help us, Shiki?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...Well, if you think about it, the fact that you're a Master probably means you're related to the Servants living here somehow, right?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
In that case, you're supposed to be the ones to get rid of them. Good luck. I'll be giving you a hand too, so don't worry.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you, Ryougi-chan!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
You can just call me Ryougi. Aren't you embarrassed, using “chan?”  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Do you like cats?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
No, I don't.  
Also, I wouldn't call that thing a cat.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
It has good fur and feels really nice, that's all. It doesn't even look like one. That's insulting to cats.  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh... I was keeping my mouth shut because she didn't look like she could take a joke... But I'm glad it all worked out!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Erm... Should I call you Miss Ryougi? You seem to know all about that apartment?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
What was it like inside? Did it turn into a different dimension? It won't kill them upon entering, right?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
As you can see, Fujimaru is just a human. If the air composition is abnormal then...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Ah, you don't have to worry.  
Rest assured, it's the same Ogawa as ever.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
But there are lots of enemies,  
and there are some funny traps.  
  
**Mash:**   
Funny traps?  
What kind of traps?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
That will be a surprise. It was a questionable property from the start anyway.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Here used to be the grave marker of an old mage who attempted to collect death. A hollow shrine that fused the yin-yang and hell together.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
People say “investigations start from the bottom,” right?  
Enjoy the case, Fujimaru.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
So once again, rookie Master... Welcome to this 64-story shrine, Ogawa Heim.  
  
## 1st Floor, Room No.1  
  
**Mash:**   
It's so cold... Something's not right, Senpai. The thermometer shows normal values, but I feel like we're inside a freezer...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Yeah, absolutely. Since there's an air conditioner, why don't you try turning on the heater?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Isn't that right, big guy? Just because your soul becomes cold, that doesn't mean your body has to be cold too, right?  
  
**Benkei:**   
...Hmm.  
  
**Mash:**   
Benkei!?  
Are you living in this room!?  
  
**Mash:**   
Or... Are you imprisoned here, like what the Doctor suggested?  
  
**Mash:**   
Please answer me, Benkei. Why did you come to this apartment?  
  
**Benkei:**   
...I don't accept it. I don't! It's unforgivable...unforgivable!  
  
**Benkei:**   
Abandoned by Heaven, forgotten by the earth, and deceived by the people! Why would you turn away from this respectable life?  
  
**Benkei:**   
Instead of training your wisdom, you mastered ugliness, It's outrageous! I can't let it be, I have to make a stand!  
  
**Mash:**   
Servant, Musashibou Benkei is switching to combat mode!  
  
**Mash:**   
I can't get a read on this situation, Master!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's attack, Mash!  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes... Let's start a Servant battle!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's attack, Shiki!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
You don't have to tell me.  
Our first opponent is a monk? Talk about a twist of fate!  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE-**  
  
**Benkei:**   
Ooohhh... Oooohhhhhh... Nghhhhhohhhhhhh!  
  
**Mash:**   
Benkei...has disappeared.  
Is he going to be all right?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmmm, I'm not sure.  
When a contract is bound to Chaldea...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
The defeated Spirit Origin doesn't return to the Throne of Heroes, but to Chaldea instead.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Given some time, he'll probably return to Chaldea.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
We still don't know why he was in that room, but it seems like you just “freed” a Servant.  
  
**Mash:**   
Is that so? He was rather aggressive, but at least we've reached a solution.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
As I thought, there's nothing here. This is the wrong room. Let's check the others, Fujimaru.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
What? You look sad...  
Don't tell me you're feeling down?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I mean... Benkei's...  
  
---  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Hey, guys. I should let you know, this apartment's always been like this, okay?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
You can feel bad for him, but I can't do anything if you let that get to you...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I mean, if you guys didn't force them out, they would've gone on like that forever.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Don't you think that would've been even more tragic?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
...That's right. It's just as Ryougi says.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
It may be a little violent, but if a Servant attacks us, we'll have to face them as enemies.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Looks like that's our best option in this apartment. Do you understand, Mash and Fujimaru?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Yes I do.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're right, this room is full of pain.  
  
---  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
We have to keep a positive mindset, no matter what. Those imprisoned here all had a negative way of thinking.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Let's keep pace and proceed with our investigation.  
  
## 1st Floor, Room No.2  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
♪♪♪♪♪  
  
**Mash:**   
Shiki seems to be in a good mood, Senpai...  
  
**Mash:**   
Humming all the while, with her hands in her pockets, skipping down the hallway...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're not feeling well, Mash?  
  
**Mash:**   
N-No. I've fought against numerous walking corpses till now, but not like this... I mean...  
  
**Mash:**   
It's the first time I fought against someone who looked like he was alive until yesterday...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She looks so happy...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
I can even tell that from across a monitor. She looks reluctant but she's actually the type who enjoys a good fight, isn't she?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
However, we can't stay uninformed like this forever.  
  
**Mash:**   
To us, it's a strange world, but to Shiki...it's a familiar scene. In that case...  
  
**Mash:**   
...Excuse me, Shiki!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Hm? What? If you need the restroom, you'll have to go outside or go inside a room.  
  
**Mash:**   
No, that's not it...  
This is an apartment, right?  
  
**Mash:**   
This place feels cold regardless of the temperature outside. Police officers and residents still walk around despite being dead.  
  
**Mash:**   
It's obviously unconventional in modern Japan. In that case, this place must be a magecraft workshop built in secrecy, right?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
If it were, it wouldn't be quite so bad... Unfortunately, this apartment was built in public with no secrets.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
A permit was submitted to the local office, and a normal construction company worked on it.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
It even asked regular folks to move in. However, now it's becoming a place no one wants to go near.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
...It's a barrier created using man's natural instinct to avoid taboos...without a single trace of Magecraft.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's common sense for mages after the 20th century to conceal their workshops in order to avoid detection from the public.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
However, we can't detect any traces of magical energy from this place.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
If it's a magecraft workshop, then whoever created it must be really cautious and patient.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
That mage built a building this size to perform a ritual, yet didn't rely on Magecraft.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
They simply built this place from the ground up, brick by brick, all by themselves. Kind of like building a tower.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Which reminds me of buddhist folklore that talks about children stacking rocks in hell, with all effort and no gain.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Just simply continuing a mundane task without complaint, and without companionship.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...The Children's Limbo, huh?  
Indeed, it fits him.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
But you're wrong, it's not a nice place like that. This is simply a building that collects death.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Death by natural causes, illness, accidents, and violence. An exhibit hall decorated with various methods of death.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Those zombies wandering the hallways, they're, you know... The previous residents of this building.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
They're designed to live one day, and die the next. Even though they already died many years ago.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...I know this might sound obvious, but humans are born with a certain fate.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
No matter how much you fight back, your eventual end&ndash;the cause of your deathwill never change.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Those destined to die in an accident, whether they've achieved happily ever after,  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
or an abrupt demise, their lives will end in a form of “accidental death.”  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...There used to be a guy who was trying to prove that, and the residents of this apartment were merely “samples” for his theory.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
When night falls, they die. When morning comes, they are reborn. No matter what happens, they always die the same way.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
It's a loop, no, a retry. Since before you guys came here, people have been coming back to life and dying, endlessly.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...How can I say it? It's...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
...I know how you feel.  
That system is... How should I put it?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Inhumane, is that what you want to say?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Hmm. You're all mages yourselves, and yet... That kind of thing still troubles you?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru is not a mage, so [♂ he /♀️ she] tends to think differently than those elites at the Mage's Association.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
But... I don't understand this building at all. What can they achieve with this kind of experiment?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
There are no results. There is no gain.  
Even if they're creating a model case, there's no goal...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
You'll have to ask the creator himself.  
Although he's no longer in this world.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Anyway, this is now a haunted apartment with zombies walking around.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
On top of that, ghosts and Servants are starting to show up. The effects are showing up in the outside world.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...Seriously. It's creepy, but this one-life-one-death world wasn't supposed to cause trouble for anybody.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I mean, what the hell are those Servants?!  
All of them are in some weird get-ups...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Mash, you were lucky that this was a haunted apartment. You would've been reported if we were in front of the station.  
  
**Mash:**   
Reported? Is that because I am not from around here?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...Say, do you know why I only carry a knife around with me?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah, so that's what you mean... You're right!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru, we're lucky that this Singularity isn't a perfect recreation of the downtown area.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
If we were in front of a station, just Mash changing into her Servant form would get us in trouble with the police.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
I didn't talk about this a lot, but Chaldea is what you would call “a secret organization.”  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
You can't recklessly summon your Servants nor arm Mash in front of people.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
It depends on the city, but Mash's Servant form could be considered indecent in some places.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
NO WAY!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You just realized?  
  
---  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...I wasn't talking about her appearance, but her weapon... Anyway...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
We're here. There's no nameplate either, right? I'm sure a Servant is living in this room.  
  
**Mash:**   
...Yes.  
I can detect a Servant's Spirit Origin in there.  
  
**Mash:**   
What will we do, Master?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's ring the doorbell.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go inside.  
  
---  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Right, that's the spirit.  
Here is the key. I will give it to you.  
  
**Mash:**   
...(Gulp)  
Master, I'll open the door.  
  
**Mash:**   
...Who on earth is inside this room?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Yes, yes, certainly!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Welcome, unknown Master!  
You too, Miss Demi-Servant!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
The one who moved into this grudge-soaked apartment, of course it is I, Demon Mephistopheles!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...What's the deal with his scissors?  
Oh, he knows Mash?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
This funny guy here is Mash's big brother or what?  
  
**Mash:**   
I couldn't take having a brother like Mephisto! The breakfast table would be a catastrophe!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
The breakfast table? That's all you're worried about? Yes, you're right, breakfast should be enjoyed quietly.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I may look like this, but I've cared for stubborn and stinky old guys, too.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I'm able to make good and tasty breakfasts, unfortunately, I'm incapable of closing this mouth!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Even if you sew it, or zip it, it's useless! Even without a mouth, I can give you bad news using ventriloquism  
  
**Mephisto:**   
For example, my neighbor in Room 3. Watanabe, was it? Tormented by his lover, whom he strangled.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
He's like a skull, a nervous wreck, malnourished! At  
2 o'clock, the time of his crime, the madness begins!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Drugs, hanging, wrist-slashing, gas poisoning.  
Every night he has to escape from his nightmare.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
His excuses for his own actions are quite unsightly, and yet pleasurable.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
There is no better spice to make a meal delicious than other people's misfortune!  
  
**Mash:**   
This manner of speaking...this is the real Mephisto! But why are you here?!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Oh? Oh, oh, oh!  
Hmm? Hum, hum, hum...  
  
**Mephisto:**   
This is the first time I'm meeting you, but how many times have you met me?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I knew it!  
I've already caused trouble for you!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
This is destiny! Conviction, betrayal and satisfaction! Now I understand why I was summoned to Chaldea!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Unfortunately, I am different from that thing,  
the “I” that was summoned in early stages!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Hahaha! Hehehehe! And!  
I am the criminal behind this case!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I am the one who invited those ghosts into this apartment!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
It was also I who infiltrated Chaldea, and lured promising-looking Servants one by one!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
That was all my handiwork!  
Yahoo! It worked perfectly!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Hmm, but now I have to break the bad news to you. Yes, Mephy is sad!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I've finally met a good Master like you, and now I have to cut you into pieces.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
You see, the previous tenant of this room had a bizarre hobby... He would sever the limbs of his loved one every night.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
He did it to hide the dead body? But get this! He tripped and accidentally killed himself while cutting up the body in the bathroom!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
It was so hilarious so I took over his job for him.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Where is this tenant now you ask?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Well, you see, now he's just in the way, right? I mean, he must be bored to death now that he can't accidentally kill himself anymore?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
That's why I intervened to make it funny. By now, he must have escaped the system, and joined his ghost buddies outside!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Now, let's start! Let's just start! It's annoying to explain so let's just start!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I am the demon, the bomber, Mephisto Pheles! The demon who blows up boring daydreams!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Wow, I repeated the word demon so many times! But it doesn't matter!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Master and Lady, please be sure to remember this, now!  
  
**Mash:**   
Mephisto Pheles is in combat mode!  
Master, what should we do?!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
What should we do? There's only one thing to do! Our opponent is ready!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Don't worry, I'm used to handling bombers. I'll wipe that smirk off his face before the bomb blows up!  
  
**--BATTLE-**  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Oh... How can this be... To ignore what you're told is a bad move, a lost cause, extreme uselessness!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
You killed me, the only one who knows the truth! Now the case is cold, dead people tell no tales. It's too late!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
But how should I put it? There are a lot of mystery novels where the perpetrator dies in the beginning, right?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
You guys, use your heads, and solve this abnormal situation!  
  
**Mash:**   
...Enemy Servant eliminated.  
Was that really the right move?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Now we have no clues...  
  
**Mash:**   
Right... Although Mephisto's words are not really trustworthy, if he really was the cause of this abnormality...  
  
**Mash:**   
...Then we just destroyed the only lead we had...  
We're bad detectives.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's visit the next Servant.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Oh, you recovered from that pretty fast. Right, that's not a bad thing.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Don't feel bad, Mash.  
Eliminating one or two perpetrators won't be an issue.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Didn't I say “investigations start from the bottom”? The next crime scene is waiting for us, detective.  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hum... Detective story... So this was a detective story? No, never mind that...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even if it was self-proclaimed, killing the perpetrator is pretty damaging...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
At least if we'd arrested him, we could've interrogated him about this place, and why it attracts ghosts...  
  
**Mephisto:**   
That's right! I'm really sorry! I wanted to be useful and use my scissors as much as possible...  
  
**Mephisto:**   
...but this time, I had nothing to do, there was no room for me to act! I ended up moving around in vain!  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes, until now, I can't remember you being useful at any time... Basically, you're totally useless...  
  
**Mash:**   
Wh-What?!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Sc-Scissors guy!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why did you come out of your room?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This is Mash's big brother?!  
  
---  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
There was another one!?  
Good, I'll kill you as many times as it takes!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Wait, no need for that.  
The one you defeated is the evil Mephisto.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
The one here is me, the good Mephisto.  
Ah, in other words...  
  
**Mephisto:**   
One of me laments this situation, and the other one enjoys it. But now is not the time to question my conscience.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
So, if I split my good heart and evil heart apart like this...  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I can basically clone myself! Oooohhh, UNBELIEVABLE!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hmm, you did show up as support.  
  
---  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Of course.  
Hmm... Fujimaru, was it?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
From now, I am a loyal Servant of Fujimaru! SO. LOYAL. (LMAO)  
  
**Mephisto:**   
To prove it, I shall part ways with my evil self and lend a hand to everyone here!  
  
**Mash:**   
Ah... It seems too good to be true, but...  
What do you think, Master?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Tell the truth in two lines or less.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Tell us what you know in two lines or less.  
  
---  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Good decision. You really are good.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Only two lines? That's impossible! But I will try. I am an innocent clown. I merely play the pipe like Hamelin did!  
  
**Mash:**   
It's two lines!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
You can do it if you try.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm. If you call yourself innocent, then you have nothing to do with this fake Singularity, right?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Not in the least! To tell you the truth... I'm truly sorry but if you could allow me to get involved, and tone down the rate of ghost-gathering,  
  
I could make a horror show, incredibly realistic, about half dead, half living, killing and being killed...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
In two lines!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I was summoned by someone else, not via Chaldea's summoning system, to this tower of resentment.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
By that guy, his name is... That guy... Grand something. That guy is one class above mine.  
  
**Mash:**   
!!!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
He said to me, “Shouldn't you be on this side?” And he does have a point, so...  
  
**Mephisto:**   
After that, I split dramatically.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
My evil self disguised itself as a Servant of Justice and infiltrated Chaldea.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I'm sure that's possible because I'm over there.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Because only Servants who were summoned by a Master can find Chaldea.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
My evil self used this clever loophole, and started recruiting.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
He said: “There's a new place to live. There are rooms for Servants. You don't need a deposit. The first month is free. Move in as fast as possible!”  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Ah, I am such a good salesman! I am jealous of myself!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
But it can't be helped. Chaldea's rooms for Servants are too small!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
No posters on the wall. No pets in the rooms, except for those that came with horses.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
That's why everyone came to this side. Then, when I got the chance...  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I escaped from the Grand-something's contract, and happily waited for all you to arrive!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Ah, I knew!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
That Fujimaru would admonish my evil self and believe in my good heart...hehe, to think that you'd believe in me!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
You heard him.  
People really trust you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't tell me you're coming with us, Mephy?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Of course I am!  
Don't think about kicking me out!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Weren't you just laughing, right now?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Of course I laughed!  
I laugh when good things happens, I'm human after all!  
  
---  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou!  
  
**Mash:**   
Fou...  
  
**Mash:**   
...Master. Fou is also encouraging you,  
let's just bring Mephisto with us.  
  
**Mash:**   
If we can make him tell us what he knows on the way, that would be great. Just don't expect too much.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're right.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Hehe, did you reach a conclusion?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mephisto, don't betray us, okay?  
  
---  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Don't worry.  
I'll absolutely obey the winner.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
In the first place, speaking of danger,  
I'm the same as Miss Assassin right there.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Please, could you add me to this investigation team? Be careful of your back and neck!  
  
**Mash:**   
...You heard him.  
Are you the same as him, Shiki?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Don't compare me with him!  
My knife cuts way better than his scissors!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's what gets you angry?!  
  
---  
  
## 1st Floor, Room No.4  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
This sure is a strange-looking apartment... Its corridors are much longer than they appear to be.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
...its elevator has a “Forever Out of Order” sign, and it's always empty.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
There's a sign that points to the stairs going up, but we'll never reach it.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ryougi, was this building always like this? Or is it just this time?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Yeah. It was always a creepy apartment, but this time it's even worse.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
The width of the corridors, the number of rooms... Stuff like that doesn't really make a difference.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
But this temperature... I can't deal with this cold. Now this really feels like a haunted house.  
  
**Mash:**   
You mentioned this as a place that collects death. It doesn't collect ghosts?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Indeed. It's more like it traps them here. It didn't collect them endlessly like this.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Now this place is like a whirlpool. It pulls in unrelated stuff and turns it into evil.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Evil?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Harmless ghosts becoming evil spirits?  
  
---  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Big swirl! Hole, gap, black hole! I got it! It's easier to understand this way!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I thought this place was like a magnetic field that attracted grudges like a lightning rod...  
  
**Mephisto:**   
But a big tree's hollow trunk is more suitable. Once you take a peek, if you're unlucky, you will fall into the eternal abyss.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Hehe... A trap hole that opened in reality? Make sure you don't push me!  
  
**Mash:**   
Mephisto, you're saying it, but stop pushing Senpai, please!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...You guys sure get along. Was he like this back in Chaldea, too?  
  
**Mash and Dr. Roman:**   
He is, without a doubt, the exact same Servant!  
No doubt about it!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Is that so!?  
I'm really troublesome!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Ah, putting that aside, Miss Ryougi?  
I'm worried about that thing you have there.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, right? I heard they can cut down anything regardless of strength.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
They sever the very activity of living. They bring instant death, yet it's different than brain death or heart attack.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I understand. I do understand...  
but they work on living things, right?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Yet you're killing zombies who are not living. How is that possible?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
That's my doubt!  
To kill dead people... It's complete nonsense!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Hell if I know. It might look the same to humans, but ceasing to live and dying are two different things.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Doesn't matter if it's zombies or ghosts, they're moving... If they are moving, that means they are “living.”  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
If it's alive, no matter what, death will come. May it be oblivion or disintegration.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
My eyes don't make any distinctions between those things.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
That is... Painful!  
You have gone through much, Miss Ryougi!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Not really. It's better than becoming a demon in order to continue living, isn't it?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
&mdash;Oh.  
You're right.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
&mdash;Stop Fujimaru!  
Watch your front and not just your back!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm detecting a Servant!  
Not in the room, it's in the corridor&mdash;  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
There's someone at the end of it!  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Hey, good evening, Mephisto.  
Are these the new tenants?  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Welcome to the grudge garden.  
Nice to meet you. I've met you before, haven't I?  
  
**Jekyll:**   
I'm Jekyll from Room 4.  
I'm the manager of this corridor, too.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
You just arrived, so you haven't mutated, right? You're not ready to go upstairs.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
It is better to stay on the first floor a little longer. It's a little cold, but you'll get used to it.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Do you want to rest a little in my room?  
It is a bit untidy right now, but you can use it.  
  
**Mash:**   
...Master... That Jekyll...  
is scary... I can't explain it, but he's very&mdash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Yeah, his eyes aren't laughing.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
His shirt is covered in blood.  
  
---  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Whaaat? Mephisto don't wanna go!  
Me don't like dirty room.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Dirty room? Is that a dirty room?  
It's no good. It's no good at all!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I like to expose people's fetishes,  
but I don't like looking at them.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
So, please, Master, decline Jekyll's invitation.  
He's not suitable as a Servant in the first place.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
If you know it's dirty, clean it up!  
Or perhaps...  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Scrupulous Jekyll is sleeping?  
You're someone who can't clean up?  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Uh... Well, to tell you the truth, you're right. I'm bad at cleaning up, and besides...  
  
**Hyde:**   
It gets dirty and red instantly!  
I can't clean it up every single time, right?!  
  
**Mash:**   
Shiki!  
  
**Hyde:**   
I see, someone here totally gets it!  
  
**Hyde:**   
But that was a perfect surprise attack! Why the hell would you block that!?  
  
**Hyde:**   
Anyway, I see that you're the same as me!  
  
**Hyde:**   
Pretending to be normal, but you're just a mass murderer who's craving to cut people's heads off!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...Tch, what was that? Disappointing... And here I was looking forward to this fated encounter.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Before I knew it, I was at Ogawa Heim.  
I was already a Servant.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Facing countless ghosts and their grudges, running into a strange Master.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Ah, yes... Fujimaru and Mash are good.  
It's not that bad yet.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
But I wasn't satisfied.  
That much I know.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
The only reason I could remain motivated was because I had a hunch! That I might run into the real thing.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
The one who came before. The world famous mass murderer with dual personalities!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
But what's this? Are you kidding me? Why did you transform? I thought we could enjoy some time together. I'm shocked.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Hey, please turn back to that kind-looking guy.  
That one is probably stronger, and I prefer him.  
  
**Hyde:**   
What? Do you prefer that moron over me? Why?  
Are you sure? This is the real me!  
  
**Hyde:**   
From that weak Jekyll, I become the strong Hyde! The one who's good with the knife is me, you know?!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...Hah. That's enough, tell him, Scissors.  
I think you can understand me.  
  
**Hyde:**   
...What?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Okay, okay. I understand you completely!  
Yes, I do, I understand you, miss!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Mr. Hyde, this is what she's saying. Don't show the ace up your sleeve too quickly. If you do that, it's basically saying, “This is my limit.”  
  
**Mephisto:**   
It's more fun to watch a good human fight while suppressing his own demons, as we still don't know what will happen!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
The catharsis of collapse, was it?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I serve under the Master because I want to witness that explosive moment!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
If you want to play with a beast that is aggressive from the start you can go to a savannah!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
That's what she wants to see!  
It's not the mass murders committed by Hyde.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
...But the immoral crimes committed by the good Jekyll as he cries tears of regret. Now that's ecstasy!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...I'm an idiot to have let you talk.  
You're completely wrong. Get out of my way.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Mephy, shocked!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
But I do prefer the goodie-goodie looking one. It's like the difference between fighting for fun and fighting for your life.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
If you have to kill, it's more enthralling to fight desperately, right?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
In other words, you are not enough.  
Come back again another time...  
  
**Hyde:**   
HAH! I see, I see!  
You can't enjoy it if it's not serious!?  
  
**Hyde:**   
You're one crazy lady!  
Then, let's have fun with this little dance!  
  
**--BATTLE-**  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Ugh... Hyde came out again...  
Sorry... Hyde and I were manipulated...  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Fujimaru, be careful with Mephisto...  
He cannot be trusted...  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Oh? Me?  
No, no. Don't you know I'm a changed man?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Wait, I can't change!  
I mean, I am already the good Mephy!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
If I change, I will become the evil one! Nope, not changing, not ever going to chaaaaaaannnge.  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Ugh... What is this, I can't maintain my body... My eyes... It's all dark...  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Fujimaru, give me your hand, please...  
I have something that I have to give you...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Offer your hand to Jekyll)  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Good... You have the heart to trust people...  
You are the Master I've always hoped for.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...  
  
**Mash:**   
...Master?!  
  
---  
  
**Jekyll:**   
Come on, take this key.  
Use it to go to the upper floor&mdash;  
  
**Jekyll:**   
But before you go... Dieeeee!  
  
**Hyde:**   
Ggg&mdash;!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Thanks.  
I will gladly accept this key.  
  
**Hyde:**   
Y-Yooouu! Twice!  
You ruined my surprise attack twice!  
  
**Hyde:**   
I'm amazed that you can't even fulfill a dying pretty boy's wish! Don't you have the heart to trust people?!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
If you were your normal self, I would've been deceived, or rather moved, by your kindness.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
But neither happened to me this time.  
I mean... You've been one personality the whole time.  
  
**Hyde:**   
&mdash;Ugh.  
Don't tell me, you already knew?!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I wanted to meet the famous Doctor Jekyll, but he is not here.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Instead of having a split personality, you were acting like someone with dual personalities.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
As a fan, you can't blame me for being disappointed, can you?  
  
**Hyde:**   
Ah... Dammit that's embarrassing. It's even more embarrassing than me losing in a knife fight.  
  
**Hyde:**   
I'd bury my head in the sand if I could. But looks like I don't need to do that, right?  
  
**Hyde:**   
Considering there's a dangerous fan here, I guess I shall take my leave.  
  
**Hyde:**   
See ya, mass murderer of the present. Just be careful and make sure you don't become a knock-off.  
  
**Mash:**   
...Enemy Servant eliminated.  
Um... What was that just now?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I don't know.  
Hey Scissors, say something.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Hehehe! Not that it's important, so I will keep it in two lines!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Dr. Jekyll fully mutated when he arrived at this apartment. Both his body and soul rotted away, so he died!  
  
**Mash:**   
Doctor Jekyll is a Servant with a split personality... So what you're saying is that his main personality is gone already?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
So Hyde, who survived, was acting like Doctor Jekyll... Just like how his story ended... So sad.  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
**Mash:**   
But what do you mean by mutated?  
  
**Mash:**   
Jekyll was a Servant who transformed into Hyde with drugs, but it seems you're not talking about those...  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Ah, I forgot to mention it.  
It is what makes this apartment special.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Certain characteristics? Past history? Criminal record? Hmmmmm, well, let's just keep that vague.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Anyway, if certain Servants stay here, their alignment will change, and become more resentful.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I myself was changed that way! Even if I want to fight, I took an arrow to the shin! Ow!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Changing Heroic Spirits' alignment?!  
Is that like a new way of tampering with parameters?!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Yes. Well, they get angry easily so it's more like stress level? Like lowering the boiling point?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
So it's not really that harmful.  
However&mdash;  
  
**Mephisto:**   
For the people that ended their life full of resentment and sadness, this place will work wonders!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Heroic Spirits ending up as evil ghosts due to their own resentment for humans... Isn't that ironic?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Yes, even the evil me used that and asked those kinds of Servants to come here.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
As you can see, all the Servants that moved here went crazy, right?  
  
**Mash:**   
Th-That's not very nice!  
Bad Mephisto! You're guilty!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Hehe, I was just doing my job as a real estate agent! The guilty ones are this land, this building, and the mastermind!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
When we meet again, it'll be in court.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I can't believe it... You have a contract with a Servant who was a judge?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Will the jury be full of homunculi? I mean, human trials can be tough, you know?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mastermind?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Oops, I was caught by Mash's beauty and said too much. Zipping my mouth now.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
You will find out yourselves when you go to the upper floors! I think!  
  
---  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
&mdash;  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Oh. Did you smile? Why?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
It's fun with Fujimaru around, clown.  
When we have fun guests, my tension blows up!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Is it possible?  
I'm always hyper like this, hyahoo!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I can see that.  
Fine, now we can go upstairs, right?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Let's move forward, Fujimaru.  
It seems the real fight starts now.  
  
## 2nd Floor, Room No.4  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Hellooo, I'm coming in!  
Oohhh! Now this is good! I like 'em charred!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
And it's smelly in here! The smell of my kind! The kind that committed a crime, and thus was labeled as a monster...  
  
**Mephisto:**   
...then ridiculed and feared by all! The kind that couldn't escape their punishment even after death!  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
&mdash;Hah! Well put!  
You're absolutely right, clown.  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
But why are you here? To give me a housewarming present? Is it because I crawled back to a dark brick room?  
  
**Mash:**   
Elisabeth... No...  
I am sure you already know...  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai, that's not the Elisabeth you know. She's already a being completely different than her original self...  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
Yes, I am a genuine Innocent Monster!  
Clown, you sure brought me something delicious-looking.  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
Good, you're so considerate!  
Let's see... I'm in the mood now!  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
What was today's party supposed to be?  
Oh well, doesn't matter! It's a feast!  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
I can take off your hands and feet while you're still alive, like shrimps, okay? Burn your organs from the inside like pigs?  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
Yes! Then I'll kill you!  
Let's kill, let's do it, humans!  
  
**Mash:**   
She's coming, Senpai! I know it's Elisabeth, but please fight with everything you've got!  
  
**--BATTLE-**  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
Ugh...  
That hurts... That hurts... That hurts!  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
...Stop it!  
Don't let me know...  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
Don't let me know that it hurts this much when my stomach is cut open! Don't force that on me!  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
So what if you tell me that other people would share the same pain! What do you expect me to do?  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
Why?! Why am I the only one miserable?!  
No matter what I do, why can't I be saved?!  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
If you say you're humans, wouldn't that make me a more lowly beast?!  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
Like a lizard, like a lizard, like a lizard... Are you telling me to crawl on the floor and get stepped on and crushed?  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
I can't stand it.  
I will not be able to stand it!  
  
**Elisabeth:**   
So, please let me kill you. Die already. Please, I beg of you, don't hesitate and KILL ME ALREADY!  
  
**Mash:**   
...Servant Elisabeth has been eliminated.  
But... That was...  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Yes, those were always her real feelings!  
For me it only sounded like a scream!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
But I am sure it was a good outlet for her. Her...pride? Or should I call it dignity?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
It must be the result of the education she received as an aristocrat. The ruling class is not allowed to lament.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
“Those who stand over others must shoulder suitable responsibility.” I am sure that idea was etched onto her.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
She picked herself up after falling, trying to aim for the top only to fall again, covered in mud. Yet she picked herself up again.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
It looks like she keeps repeating the process as her atonement. Hmmm, kind of like a dragon that keeps collecting shining treasure in its dungeon.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
That's why, don't mind the ugly side of her you've just witnessed. Next time you see her...  
  
**Mephisto:**   
...just say, “Your horns are pretty cute,” and everything will be okay!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Really? If that was her repressed scream, wouldn't that eventually poison her and turn her into a real monste... Whoa! What's going on?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
T-T-Trouble, Romani! I don't know why, but Elisabeth all of sudden charged into my workshop!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
And she started saying, “I just woke up, and somehow I am feeling really refreshed!”  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
“That's why I made you some snacks to show my appreciation for you! Come eat them! Eat them with gratitude in your heart!”  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh no, it's melting! Why is the sauce from that plate burning my Mona Lisa?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Help me Romani! I can't deal with her by myself! No... Why is this happening...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Did she just roast three golems and turn them into a bunch of cookies?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay, there's nothing to worry! Chaldea is as peaceful as ever, Fujimaru!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Don't worry and keep investigating that apartment. I won't worry about what just happened either and focus on backing you up.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
R-Right.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If only we had Marugoshi David here...  
  
---  
  
**Mephisto:**   
See? You can punch her all you want but she gets back up. That's our Elisabeth!  
  
## 3rd Floor, Room No.4  
  
**Mash:**   
Ah... This room seems normal.  
The room's resident is...  
  
**Boudica:**   
Hi. Good evening, Mash, Fujimaru.  
Welcome to my room.  
  
**Boudica:**   
Are you here to bring me back?  
Thank you very much. But&mdash;  
  
**Mash:**   
But... What, Boudica?  
Are you also...  
  
**Boudica:**   
You can't come in without ringing the bell. As your big sis, I have to scold you.  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai! Thank goodness!  
Boudica hasn't changed!  
  
**Mash:**   
Reliable, kind, and warm hugs galore!  
That's our Boudica!  
  
**Boudica:**   
What? Oh, Mash, is that what you think of me? Someone who hugs at every possible chance?  
  
**Boudica:**   
Anyway. I just made a stew. Will you have some with me, Fujimaru?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, of course.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Eat up, so we can all go home.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes! You are way past your limit, Senpai.  
I think it's good for you to replenish some energy.  
  
**Mash:**   
After we finish our meal, let's go back to Chaldea for the time being. We also have to bring Boudica back&mdash;  
  
**Boudica:**   
&mdash;Go back?  
What are you talking about, Mash?  
  
**Boudica:**   
Don't joke around with me.  
Who said I would go back?  
  
**Boudica:**   
I won't go back. There's no place for me to go back to. That's because... Everything... YOU TOOK EVERYTHING!  
  
**Boudica:**   
We were the king's only family.  
My daughter and I were all he had!  
  
**Boudica:**   
That's why I was going to inherit the throne... Yet I was told women have no right to inheritance...  
  
**Boudica:**   
YOU BASTARDS! YOU ROMANS TOOK EVERYTHING FROM ME!  
  
**Mash:**   
Boudica...  
  
**Boudica:**   
I had forgotten. I tried to distract myself with the cause of “saving humanity.”  
  
**Boudica:**   
However... This anger. This hatred.  
This vengeance...  
  
**Boudica:**   
I won't let anybody get in my way, no matter who it is! In the name of Queen of Victory, I'll make an example of you!  
  
**--BATTLE-**  
  
**Boudica:**   
...Ah... What... What did I...  
I see... I just embarrassed myself...  
  
**Boudica:**   
Queen of Victory... How funny... I've lost every fight that's worth fighting...  
  
**Mash:**   
...Servant Boudica has been eliminated.  
There is nothing more in this room, Master.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Let's go outside.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Let's continue our investigation.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes. Let's find the cause of all this as soon as possible.  
  
**Mash:**   
Why is it like this?  
Why are they doing it?  
  
**Mash:**   
Let's move forward to find those answers!  
  
## 4th Floor, Room No.4  
  
**Mash:**   
...Senpai, we're almost done investigating the 4th floor. If what happened on the first floor applies to every floor...  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
Leave. The floor above is crawling with vengeful ghosts. It's not a place for the living.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
(Completely stunned by a horse suddenly appearing)  
  
**Mash:**   
Enemy Servant appeared!  
Prepare for battle, Master!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I've never seen this Servant.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That suspicious helmet... That's the mastermind!  
  
---  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
...Hum.  
  
**Mash:**   
I am sure! This pressure, this evil magical energy I am sensing...  
  
**Mash:**   
That's a Servant more chaotic-evil than Mephisto here!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Hyahoo! Exactly! That there is the evil Dark Knight, the crow that devours the dead.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
...No, wait!  
  
**Mash:**   
I get chills just from the gaze beyond that helmet! That Servant is cold-hearted!  
  
**Mash:**   
Master, be careful...  
That is not someone we can talk to!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Let's defeat that Servant! Oh I can't stop laughing! Hehehe, kill, let's kill!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Inside that armor is probably a hollow shell like the ghosts outside, or a bony skeleton!  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
...Hey!  
Who are you calling a bony skeleton?  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
Feast your eyes upon this body! One that belongs to the King of Storms, the protector of the holy lance!  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
LOOK! CLOSELY!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
(Completely stunned by her taking off her armor)  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Whoa! Time to record this! Where's my recorder!?  
  
**Fou:**   
Fooooooooooou!  
  
**Mash:**   
Wh-What?  
Have we met before?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Didn't we fight in that massive cavern before?  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
...Indeed.  
You are very perceptive, Fujimaru.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
That was a different aspect of myself, but still the same person.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
Your perceptiveness deserves a compliment. You show much promise. However...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't remember you. I mean those breasts...  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
(Her eyes are saying, “I will kill you if you finish that sentence.”)  
  
**Fou:**   
Fo...Fou...  
  
---  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
Unlike my armor, my patience is wearing thin. Especially when it comes to humiliation.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
You ruffians have witnessed a king's face. Since it has come to that, a fight cannot be avoided.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
I shall forgive your disrespect if you can survive and prove your bravery to me. If you can't, your soul will be mine.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
I am the King of Storms, the Wild Hunt itself! All those who witness my face shall become my servant.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
My limbs, my offerings... Cry as you gather under me. Be as crimson as velvet, fit to decorate my hooves.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
This tower here is my castle. Here I go, human! Resist your fate with all of your might!  
  
**Mash:**   
Lancer Alter is attacking us after saying all those cool lines!  
  
**Mash:**   
Master, your orders, please!  
You too, Shiki! Be prepared!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Ah, yes, thank you, you saved me!  
She almost gave me a heart attack!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
What the hell is she doing on a horse in an apartment! That's creepier than any ghosts in this place!  
  
**--BATTLE-**  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
...Insolent fool. The eyes that can see death, huh? To think my servants will be disposed of so easily.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
If she's with you then you can win. I have no more reasons to stop you.  
  
**Mash:**   
Master, Lancer Alter has lowered her spear.  
  
**Mash:**   
Unlike the other Servants,  
maybe she still hasn't mutated?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Of course she hasn't. I mean, she's just not cut out for it.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
How should I put this... The heart that's not afraid to go all out? The courage to pursue desires? Kind of like the class president?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
No matter how strong she becomes,  
she never seems to turn into a cruel queen.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Unless you pour ale into the Holy Grail and have her drink it, she will never become a villain.  
  
**Mash:**   
That's very much like her.  
But why is she blocking our way?  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
...Hmm. I can't let people without light tread into the darkness.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
I am here to filter the people who can't resist against the grudge in this place.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
But with that woman around,  
any immortal will face death.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
That's why I will allow you to proceed. Besides...  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
Even with a light, it's common to be eaten by beasts.  
I will enjoy watching how far you can go.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wow, what a scary laugh...  
She looks like a cruel queen to me... Cruel enough...  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
You talk too much, mage. Small talk is strictly prohibited. Instead of speaking, keep moving!  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ouch, she scolded me... She's like a class president alright. Now for the necessary questions.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Heroic Spirit of the Holy Spear. Why are you here? Did Mephisto trick you into coming, too?  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
I don't know about that.  
I came of my own free will.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
...This is the tower that gathers grudges.  
It is the cenotaph that imprisons death.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
Originally it should've been drowned in the darkness of history. But someone dug it up, and tried to convert it to a Singularity.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Someone... It's probably the same person who's incinerated humanity. But you said they tried, did they fail?  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
...This is what you will find out from your investigation. Indeed, the King's plan ended in miscalculation.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
That's probably because he sent the wrong man for the job. As a result, this place did not turn into a Singularity.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
Instead, it became a tower that attracts and imprisons Servants, turning them into demons.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
There are many types of death that come here. Someday, it will become the Singularity called “Hell.”  
  
**Mephisto:**   
So this is the gate of Hell, right? That means I am most suitable to be your guide!  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
Now, even if a Hell wasn't created here, one already exists. Adding one or two more holes to it wouldn't be a problem. However...  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
If you can't overlook that fact, then do whatever you see fit.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
This place has no effect on the incineration of humanity. The mutation of the Servants is the result of their own doing.  
  
**Mash:**   
...That's what she thinks...  
What should we do, Senpai?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course, we will go up.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We can't abandon our Servants.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Roger!  
I will go with you, Master!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...Even if it won't cause any harm to you, you'll still intervene? You sure are a curious one.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Or are you just nosy?  
Chaldea is more laid-back than I thought.  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
That's not it. It is my duty as a king.  
An inferior being like you wouldn't understand.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Don't be ridiculous. Even inferior civilians have their path! Especially, when it's related to our own territory.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Oh well... We've already defeated the large chested woman, so let's go ahead Fujimaru.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
If we keep looking at those things, it'll mess up our sense of scale! More than enough is too much, you know?  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
Heh. No one who has more than enough says that. I will accept it as sour grapes.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Okay, okay. Ah, how about that Room No. 4? That is your room, right? Can we go inside?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
You clean it up everyday, right?  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
Eh&mdash;?  
  
**Lancer Alter:**   
No! Absolutely not! If you go in, you will die! What the hell are you thinking?!  
  
## Into the Woods  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm? Are you outside the apartment right now? Seems like you're in the vicinity.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru, you're supposed to investigate the building. What are you doing outsid&mdash;  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm. The reception's not good here. There's a weird magnetic fiel&mdash;and the observation has sto&mdash;  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai, we've lost contact with the Doctor!  
  
**Mash:**   
Although I don't think it's mechanical failure, since the spiritrons are unstable around here...  
  
**Mash:**   
Speaking of which, what are we doing here, Senpai? The Doctor said our range of investigation should be within the apartment building.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
No, Fujimaru's intuition is right.  
This is the spot.  
  
**Mash:**   
Shiki?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...Someone strange is here. Come out. If you want to hide, you should do something about that murderous aura.  
  
**???:**  
I don't have such bloodlust. All I have is this righteous rage.  
  
**Mash:**   
...A-A Servant?  
But... I can't see him... I can't see him at all, Master!  
  
**Mash:**   
He's right in front of me, but all that's there is pure darkness...  
  
**Mash:**   
He's a little different than the remnants of Servants - Shadow Servants!  
  
**Mash:**   
Also, not Saber... Lancer... Archer... He doesn't belong to any of the seven classes!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is he a Ruler then!?  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
Mediation is the furthest thing from what I do. I'll take that as you picking a fight with me.  
  
**???:**  
Who are you all, anyway?  
Why would you walk around killing ghosts?  
  
**???:**  
They were unrewarded in life,  
and their regrets keep them away from death.  
  
**???:**  
The defeated who were abandoned by life, and left behind by death. They chose emptiness over peacefulness.  
  
**???:**  
...Yes, they are nameless, formless monsters. These souls, rejected by even the other side, need peace.  
  
**???:**  
If Hell denies them, then I will create a new Hell. That's why this tower must be filled with their grudges.  
  
**???:**  
That is my faith, and why I exist.  
Oh light, do not stand in my way.  
  
**G：???:**  
&mdash;  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou, fooooooou!  
  
**Mash:**   
Fou is more excited than ever!  
That ghost doesn't seem to be an ordinary ghost!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Oh, this is not good.  
This is not good, Master Fujimaru.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
That's an Innocent Monster with super-recovery, super-stamina, and super-skills. The ultimate form of someone who absolutely hates humans.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
In the world of Magecraft, there's this thing called something-Murder that can reliably kill any primate species.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
And what we have here is a nameless weakling who seems to be reaching that state.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
A shame. My dream of seeing Master's destruction is going to end here. You know why, yes?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Because we are all going to die here.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
You're giving up awfully early, clown.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
True, we'll be done here if that's a real Monster of Gaia, but... he's just a defective Monster of Alaya.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
If our opponent is a ghost who's fallen into madness after death, we'll just have to fight with the same amount of madness.  
  
**Mash:**   
Shiki? Huh? What's going on?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Nice to meet you, Mash.  
Good evening, Fujimaru.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I was trying my best not to come out, but given who we're fighting, I had no choice.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
If you'd like, please use me for a little bit.  
  
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes, thank you very muc&mdash;  
Wait, that's not it!  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai, Shiki's acting weird! The fact that she all of a sudden changed clothes is not the problem...  
  
**Mash:**   
...It's that she's so graceful, flowers themselves bloom in shame. She is the embodiment of pure beauty.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Oh my. That's what surprises you?  
It's refreshing seeing you acting like a girl.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...Really, it's a bit of a shame.  
You aren't cut out for battle, Mash.  
  
**G：???:**  
&mdash;  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...Humph. You ruined the mood.  
I was starting to feel so sad and warm, too...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
It's the fault of the land here that a ghost like this grew so strong.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I just remembered.  
Is this where that mage died?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Shiki... Behind you!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I know.  
Now let's finish this!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This happened before.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Yes. I don't remember it,  
but if you do...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
&mdash;Hehe. Then it must be fate.  
It's strange, but it makes me very happy.  
  
---  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
You said you wanted to create a Hell here. But that's Lord Enma's jurisdiction.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Even Hell doesn't welcome an amplifier for hateful screams... Your possible dream... Let it disappear into the rift of this world.  
  
**--BATTLE-**  
  
**Mash:**   
Enemy ghost eliminated!  
We did it! Thank you very much Shi...ki?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Oww... I tripped on a tree root. That was lame of me...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Hmm? Oh, you took care of it while I was screwing around. Thanks, Fujimaru, Mash.  
  
**Mash:**   
No, um... That was you, actually.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's okay. Let's not say anything, Mash.  
  
**Mash:**   
...You're right. She seems to have her reasons.  
  
**Mash:**   
...But that kimono was so beautiful. I wish I could've asked her more questions.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Shiki, you're a magical girl?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Magical girl? What are you talking about? I'm too old to be a “girl” anyway.  
  
---  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Oh, what is it, Fou? You want praise, too? ...Wait, what's that? A key?  
  
**Mash:**   
Seems like it was hidden here.  
Good work, Fou. (Pat, pat)  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Oh my! It seems Shiki wants to touch his fur, too! Go ahead and touch my cape, then!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
My cape is an exquisite item made from 100% devil hair!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Come on, touch it!  
It's gorgeous!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...Fine.  
I guess it'll have to do. Let me touch it.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Oh no! Mephy's in danger!  
You just tried to sever my cuticles, didn't you!?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Oh, sorry.  
I couldn't help myself. That long hair was annoying me.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
You're doing it all wrong! You use scissors to cut hair! Your knife would shave my entire head bald!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I try very hard to be a dandy gentleman! I'll defend my hair to the death!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
!!!  
It's a fashion statement!?  
  
## 5th Floor, Room No.4  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
...The Spiritron density's highest on this floor. Looks like we're at the center of this apartment.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
We've defeated dozens of ghosts so far, but this response is far bigger than any of them.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
The core that created this fake Singularity... The soul, or Spirit Origin if you will, of this area.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
And it's close.  
Be careful, Fujimaru.  
  
**Mash:**   
Understood.  
...We're almost at the end of the hallway.  
  
**Mash:**   
That room seems to be the last one...  
Shiki, are you picking up anything.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Listen, the only thing I'm picking up is cold shivers. I can't detect magical energy like Fujimaru.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
It's more like intuition for me.  
That, and how much death there is.  
  
**Mash:**   
Whether there's death, huh?  
  
**Mash:**   
You haven't talked about it,  
but what does it feel like to see death?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
It's creepy, basically. I told you before, what I see is a thing's lifespan.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...Everything has a seam.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Those seams usually look like lines.  
Run a knife down them and that part will “die.”  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
If you have time, you can ask a mage you know for the more detailed theory.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
In my case, I happened to know this weird mage. She told me all kinds of stuff I didn't want to know.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...Well, I'll probably never see her again. But maybe you have someone who knows her?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
I don't know. Chaldea's got a lot of funds, but we're basically isolated in the mountains.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyway, were you born with those eyes? Have you been seeing that scary view since you were born?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I was born with them, but they didn't awaken until I got into an accident.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I basically died once.  
When I woke up, the whole world had changed.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...Tch. Why are we talking about me, anyway?  
Look, we're here. This is the center of the building.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Hehehe! At last we're here!  
Yes, yes, this is it! This is it!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I remember this place!  
I was first summoned here!  
  
**Mash:**   
...So there's something here that's creating this fake Singularity, right?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Of course!  
It wouldn't make sense if there wasn't!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Who could it be? I'm so excited! I'm so nervous, everyone! Aren't you?  
  
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Yes.  
It's not appropriate to say this, but I'm interested.  
  
**Mash:**   
Thanks to you, I'm not as nervous now, Mephisto.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're a pro at livening things up, Mephisto.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It was a little bit noisy though.  
  
---  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Hehehe! Of course! I'm talking as much as usual for your sake, Fujimaru!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
That means he's just acting like his normal self!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
So you won't change your ways for anything, huh? You really do seem to be having fun, though.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Of course I am.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I'm with a Master who'll hang out with a devil like me, even if they do think I'm a little weird!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
How could this not be fun!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
This is so fun! I'm so happy! It's really like a dream come true!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...Yeah.  
You're being honest for once, huh Scissors?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Okay. Let's go inside.  
Are you ready, Fujimaru?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
What is this room!? There's no boundary lines!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's like Scáthach's Land of Shadows!  
If we don't stop this thing&mdash;  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
Welcome, everyone!  
Have you been satisfied so far?  
  
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Huh?  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
Of course we have!  
Hello, me! Thanks for watching the Boundary!  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou!  
  
**Mash:**   
Another set of Mephistos!?  
Even though we got rid of the evil one!?  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
What are you saying, lady Mash?  
I'll ask you not to underestimate me.  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
I am a devil!  
I've only got a single good heart within me&mdash;  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
But I've got far more than one or two hearts of evil! I've got so many you couldn't count them all!  
  
**Mash:**   
That's surprisingly convincing!  
I have no come back to that, Master!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's Mephisto. What can you do?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We just have to keep punching him until he reforms.  
  
---  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
Yes, perfect!  
I wanted to see you go around defeating all the evil mes.  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
That's why I came here in the first place!  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
Come, come! Go right ahead! Behind that evil me is a Greater Ghost.  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
That's the keystone of this Bounded Field! The Great Avici Hell, which draws spirits of the dead here and turns them into a pillar!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...It's huge. How hard is it gonna be for that to die? There's so many lines I could never cut them all!  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
Hehehe! Of course it's hard!  
It's a copy-paste of over a hundred million deaths!  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
And you're going to join the other ghosts in it! But before that&mdash;  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
There's something I don't quite understand. I'm talking about you, Fujimaru.  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
Say, why are you doing all of this? This isn't your problem at all.  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
It's true that Servants were trapped here.  
But they mutated of their own will.  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
They all wanted to be that way. There was no need for you to go to considerable length to come and save them.  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
This apartment is located in a different dimension, yes. But it's only a fake Singularity. It's safe to ignore.  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
Even if humanity's foundations were restored, this place would simply sit outside the world and quietly gather hatred and pain.  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
Looking at this sort of hell is my job, which is why I'm here working.  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
But why are you getting involved?  
No one asked you. And this isn't revenge.  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
There's nothing to be gained for you by solving this problem!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
&mdash;  
  
**Mash:**   
Well...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Everyone looks like they're suffering.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A hobby. Just like you.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Right! It doesn't matter what we gain! It felt like we needed to solve this!  
  
**Mash:**   
That's the kind of person Senpai is! Someone who can't look away from pain and sadness.  
  
**Mash:**   
...I still remember Senpai holding my hand that day when I was scared in the Command Room...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Everyone looks like they're suffering, huh? And I guess “everyone” includes the ghosts.  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
&mdash;SIGH. Then I guess I'll have no choice but to kill you.  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
I am a devil. It's no fun if someone does something just because they want to.  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
I can't tempt them with anything. Which means I can't trade with them!  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
And in the face of someone like that, you know... I would have no choice but to truly submit!  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
And if I was loyal like that, I wouldn't be a devil anymore, would I?  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
I am here as myself.  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
As long as I'm needed as the devil Mephisto Pheles... It would be rude to my wonderful Master not to do my job!  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
Ooh, that's me for you!  
A devil more devilish than any devil!  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
But as the me on Master's side, this is a problem. I don't think I can beat that Greater Ghost.  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
The evil devil me wants to be defeated by my Master. The good devil me just wants to survive and doesn't care about anyone else.  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
What is this? Mixing both me together would make me look like the strongest, wouldn't it!?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Idiot. Just shut up and work with us.  
It's the only way you'll survive.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Let's do it, Mash, Scissors.  
Fujimaru's answer persuaded me.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I'd been wondering the whole time, too.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Fujimaru has a place to call home.  
Why get involved in someone else's hell?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
But I guess I know the answer now.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
This one is the same kind of idiot as Mikiya! So there's no sense in thinking about it!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Idiots never listen to you, after all!  
They just make everyone's lives difficult!  
  
**Mash:**   
Right... right! I agree, Shiki!  
That's our Master!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Then let's finish this thing!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I'm thinking that I want to go to this Chaldea of yours!  
  
**--BATTLE-**  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
The massive ghost has vanished!  
Now the fake Singularity is done for!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Bye now, lying devil.  
Time for you to head back home!  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
Ayye&mdash;yeee!  
It's so sharp!  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
So this is a death line!?  
It's so sharp, huh miss?  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
It's a clean cut! I didn't feel anything and there's no blood! But there's terror and pleasure!  
  
**Evil Mephisto:**   
Oh, I have to disappear!  
I can't take it anymore!  
  
**Mash:**   
The enemy Servant and massive ghost have been eliminated. &mdash;We won, Master.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good work, everyone.  
  
---  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
Hehe. Hehehehe!  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
Good work! Good work, huh?  
An airhead until the end, you are!  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
But that's unforgettable, unattainable, and I want to die! Good work! And farewell!  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
Though... When you're a devil like me you don't do farewells like this often!  
  
**Mash:**   
Good Mephisto!?  
W-Why are you starting to disappear?  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
Why? That's a strange question  
Killing that me means killing this me as well!  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
Listen, if you defeat an evil heart,  
the good heart isn't going to somehow survive, okay?  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
I am me because of my evil.  
And I am me because of my good.  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
You are who you are because of your strengths.  
I am who I am because of my weaknesses.  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
It's best to disappear together. That is what we are.  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
Because&mdash;if only one of us were to survive, that would be a sad thing.  
  
**Good Mephisto:**   
They say a man can't live by himself!  
Although, I am a devil!  
  
**Mash:**   
&mdash;  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...Yeah.  
Did you have fun, Scissors?  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Yes, I did! The best days of my devilish life! Um, yes. Enough that I'm going to miss it.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Anyway, I will be off!  
I'll be joining the ghosts!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, I'll see you soon, Mephisto Pheles.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll summon you soon.  
  
---  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Hehehe. Hehehehe.  
That's wrong. That's a different me. Not this me.  
  
**Mephisto:**   
I'm not human.  
In fact, I was never human at all&mdash;  
  
**Mephisto:**   
So I don't remember what happened yesterday, and I probably won't remember you!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
That's what a devil is! Either they destroy the one they contract with, or that one will destroy them!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Nothing remains. For if it did, it would weigh on me. I wouldn't be able to have fun deceiving you, Master!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Goodbye, everyone&mdash;  
The devil Mephisto Pheles will be leaving now!  
  
**Mephisto:**   
Splendid, splendid work, Fujimaru!  
You have done well to awaken from the sleep of death!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
...  
  
**Mash:**   
...Heroic Spirit Mephisto Pheles is gone.  
It's over, Shiki, Senpai.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Over?  
Well, I guess it is.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Once that massive ghost is gone, this apartment building will go back to being abandoned.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
When the time comes, there'll be nothing left. Like what Scissors said, that's life.  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes. It is a little lonely, though.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Okay. Let's head back to this Chaldea place, Fujimaru.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
No, should I call you Master?  
That's the rule for Servants, right?  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? You're coming too?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
What, am I not welcome? I've helped you this far.  
...Not that it was my main goal.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I was troubled too.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I thought I'd wake up if I found the cause, but it's not happening. Instead, I feel more alert than ever.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
This place is going to disappear soon.  
So Chaldea's the only place I can go.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
If I work for you as a Servant,  
then you can give me lodgings, food, and clothing, right?  
  
**Mash:**   
It's true...We can't just leave her.  
Senpai?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Welcome to Chaldea.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thanks for coming, Ryougi.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Right!  
Thanks for working with us, Shiki!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Thanks.  
Okay, let's get going.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
If you need ghosts, zombies, or anything else weird taken out, I'm the one. Use me as you like.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Thanks, Fujimaru.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I won't go as far as Scissors,  
but I'll follow you to the gates of Hell.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Damn... Another weirdo, huh?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
But it's good that Chaldea will be livelier.  
I'll get her a room ready quickly.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru, good work. I can see the fake Singularity response beginning to weaken.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
The massive ghost maintaining it vanished.  
That apartment building will vanish soon.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Servants who were trapped will come back when the building disappears.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
If you forgot anything, take care of it.  
Chaldea always needs more resources.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
But don't spend too much time there!  
I'll be waiting for you in the Command Room!  
  
## 6th Floor, Room No.1  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
 Excuse the intrusion!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
 Good morning!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Although we resolved the incident, it seems there are still some Servants trapped inside the building.  
  
**Mash:**   
So we continued our search and rescue efforts,  
but... but...  
  
**Fran:**   
Uuuu... Uuuuuuu!  
Uuu! Uuuu, uuuu, uuuu!  
  
**Mash:**   
That's too bright! Too bright and too intense!  
  
**Mash:**   
I don't know what you're so excited about, but try to calm down a little, Fran!  
  
**Lu Bu:**   
  
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)  
  
**Mash:**   
Wah! Even General Lu?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Doctor, translate!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huuhhhh?  
I can do something like that?  
  
**Mash:**   
Doctor, I can give it a try!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
 Mash, translate!  
  
**Mash:**   
O-okay, I'll try!  
  
---  
  
**Fran:**   
...Uuuu... Te...sla...  
Uuuuuu!  
  
**Mash:**   
Umm, Tesla?  
That same Tesla that recently joined Chaldea?  
  
**Fran:**   
Uuuu!  
  
**Mash:**   
Um...  
  
**Fran:**   
Uuuu?  
Uu?  
  
**Fran:**   
...Uuuuu...  
  
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Invigorating. Absolutely invigorating, and most comfortable! Reading a book under the gleam of electric light... How dazzling!  
  
**Nikola Tesla:**   
My unstoppable intelligence is essentially skyrocketing at an eel-lectrifying rate! All because of electricity!  
  
**Nikola Tesla:**   
...What, you didn't get that? I mentioned eels because, well, they're a god-like fish that can generate electricity... Well, never mind.  
  
**Nikola Tesla:**   
In any case, let's try increasing the brightness even further. This is all 500W can produce. How would it be if we doubled that?  
  
**Nikola Tesla:**   
It's evident that my intelligence will likely reach divine levels, and soon I won't even have to read anymore!  
  
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Hahahahaha! Now then, allow me to show you&mdash;  
  
**Nikola Tesla:**   
System Keraunos!  
  
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Hrmm? A power outage? Well, that's problematic. But really, what a genius I am...  
  
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I can learn a lesson even from a situation like this! That lesson being&mdash; It's important to conserve electricity!  
  
**Fran:**   
Uuuuuuu&mdash;!?  
  
**Fran:**   
Naaaaaaaaaaooooooooo  
oooooooooo!  
  
**Mash:**   
She's angry that Tesla uses up all of the electricity...  
  
**Mash:**   
She says she's also decided to start wasting electricity. Ah, I see...  
  
**Fran:**   
Uu&mdash;!  
Uuu! Uu! Uuau!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's getting harder to see in here.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's so bright!  
  
---  
  
**Lu Bu:**   
![berserk1](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)&ndash;!  
  
**Mash:**   
Lu Bu says...  
Um...  
  
**Mash:**   
“I lent her a hand, because she looks like my daughter.”  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh, I guess he's not actually angry.  
  
**Lu Bu:**   
![berserk2](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)&mdash;!  
  
**Mash:**   
Wah?!  
  
**Mash:**   
“There is no parent that wouldn't get angry watching their daughter cry” is what he said! S-Sorry!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I see. So the complaints we've been getting lately ordering us to do something about the frequent power outages is due to this.  
  
**Mash:**   
Shiki? What are you looking at?  
Is that...a notepad?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
In any case, let's take care of this. We'll talk afterward.  
  
**Fran:**   
Uuuuuuuaaaaaa&mdash;!  
  
**--BATTLE-**  
  
**Fran:**   
Fuuuu...uuu&ndash;!  
  
**Mash:**   
Don't worry Fran, we will give Tesla an earful later...  
  
**Fran:**   
Uu...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
 We should have Electricity Conservation Day at Chaldea.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We should give the professor a taser as a present.  
  
---  
  
**Fran:**   
Uu!  
Uu♪  
  
**Mash:**   
And just like that, she's mellowed out again!  
  
**Lu Bu:**   
...  
  
**Mash:**   
Whew... The room is finally dark again. My eyes are still seeing stars from all that light...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
This may be a little sudden, but can I say something?  
  
**Mash:**   
Sure, Doctor.  
What's the matter?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hold on, wait!  
Fran is...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
She's saying, “In order to conserve electricity, I'm unplugging any piece of equipment of unknown function that I find.”  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ahhh, wait a second! Please don't pull the plug on that one!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
At least let me shut it down properly... Ah.  
  
**Mash:**   
...It was unfortunate, wasn't it?  
  
**Fou:**   
Fu, aauu.  
  
**Mash:**   
By the way, Shiki...  
What was that memo earlier?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Oh, this? This is the request I got. It says, “Please resolve the cause of the power outages,” so...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
All right, that takes care of that one. Next up is “Please evict the bad tenant who refuses to pay rent.”  
  
**Mash:**   
Um... I hope I'm guessing wrong, but are these possibly...complaints from all the neighbors here?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Oh, didn't I mention that?  
Based on the information I have...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...they're complaints requesting the removal of Servants who are living in this apartment building illegally.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
That's why I've been chasing out Servants. Here, look. This building is owned by the Ryougi Family, you see.  
  
**Mash:**   
Shiki, you're a landlord?!  
And this is basically&mdash;  
  
**H：Ryougi Shiki:**   
Yes. I came here on behalf of my family to collect everyone's rent.  
  
**H：Ryougi Shiki:**   
In that case, let's switch gears from here on out, Mash, Fujimaru.  
  
**Mash:**   
I understand! Now that you mentioned it, you do dress like a landlord huh, Shiki?  
  
## 6th Floor, Room No.4  
  
**Mary:**   
Ahh. So you've finally come. I was getting tired of waiting.  
  
**Mary:**   
Are you from Silver Saucer?  
Or Othello Pizza?  
  
**Mary:**   
Well, either is fine. As always, leave the loot at the door and get out. I'll spare your life, at least.  
  
**Mash:**   
The kitchen is stuffed full of empty food cartons... There are empty pizza boxes stacked up in a tower...  
  
**Mash:**   
This is unmistakably the apartment of a rundown corporate worker! It's a weary corporate worker's apartment, Senpai!  
  
**Anne:**   
Yeees? Is someone calling for me?  
  
**Anne:**   
...Oh? You're not the mail order delivery man, are you? Call him, will you?  
  
**Anne:**   
Please hurry and deliver my Top 100 High-Seas Adventure Novels set. I'm so beyond bored. We just keep getting food deliveries.  
  
**Anne:**   
Oh, and of course, you won't charge us for this, right? As you can see, we haven't got a penny to our name♪  
  
**Mash:**   
Even you're living this slothful life, Anne?!  
Listen, you two! Where has your pride as pirates gone?!  
  
**Mash:**   
Where are the girls who smiled, saying that they didn't seek the Holy Grail for treasure, but for treasure maps?  
  
**Mary:**   
I suppose you could say we tossed them into the sea of the internet... All because that black-haired bastard suggested we try it out...  
  
**Anne:**   
Yes... It's just so useful... And vast... And stimulating... And also comforting...  
  
**Anne & Mary:**   
Before we knew it, we had sunk down into this lifestyle! But it's all right, because we're pirates!  
  
**Anne & Mary:**   
The deliveryman threatened us for payment with a musket, so we sliced up the invoice with our cutlasses!  
  
**Anne & Mary:**   
That's the pirate way! That's our new pride as pirates!  
  
**Anne & Mary:**   
Mash! Master!  
You can't grow up to become like us, okay?!  
  
**Mash:**   
This is awful!  
That black-haired person is in for some serious trouble.  
  
## 7th Floor, Room No.1  
  
**Leonidas:**   
Raaaarrgh&mdash;!  
Raaaaaargh&mdash;!  
  
**Fou:**   
Fooou?!  
  
**Mash:**   
It's Leonidas this time?!  
But that can't be!  
  
**Mash:**   
The Servants we've met so far in this apartment building have all, undoubtedly, had dangerous sides to them.  
  
**Mash:**   
But Leonidas shouldn't have any kind of dark side like that! I mean... I mean!  
  
**Mash:**   
Leonidas never hated others nor lost sight of himself. He always protected the rear. He is the Guardian of the Thermopylae...  
  
**Mash:**   
I respect him! He was ranked as the best shield-holding Heroic Spirit in Chaldea this season!  
  
**Mash:**   
There are no bad people among the shield-holding Heroic Spirits!  
  
**Leonidas:**   
Raaaaaaargh!  
Die! Die&mdash;!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash, I understand how you feel, but calm down! No matter how you look at him, he's clearly been altered somehow!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
There's no way that mule-headed, pardon, I mean, that earnest, steady King Leonidas would run around swinging his sword and shouting, “Die!”  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Like the other Servants we've met here, his darkness has been drawn out by this apartment complex!  
  
**Mash:**   
Doctor! Get out!  
Leonidas doesn't have a dark side!  
  
**Mash:**   
If he did, there's no way he could have inspired 300 soldiers to stand up against an army of over 100,000 enemies!  
  
**Mash:**   
He's a very solemn man, and the Guardian of Thermopylae! The valorous and indomitable King Leonidas harbors no evil nor fear in his heart!  
  
**Leonidas:**   
Aaaauughh, I'm scared of ghosts&mdash;!  
I'm scared&mdash;! I'm scared&mdash;!  
  
**Leonidas:**   
I've failed. I came here to rescue my comrades and became trapped in this hell! Now I'm so frightened I can't take a single step outside this room!  
  
**Leonidas:**   
I can face any physical enemy, be it dragon, or dog-like man! But not ghosts! For some reason, I just can't handle ghosts!  
  
**Leonidas:**   
And yet, I slash and slash, but there are ghosts and more ghosts! Are they without number?! What?! New ghosts?!  
  
**Leonidas:**   
They take the forms of my Master and Lady Mash!  
  
**Leonidas:**   
Curse you! How dare you strike me where I am weak?! What fearsome wit you have, Ghost!  
  
**Leonidas:**   
Arrrgh, how my blood boils at this outrage! So reprehensible, it makes the very hair upon my head smolder!  
  
**Leonidas:**   
Raaarrgh! Aid me, valorous men of Sparta!  
Here I come! Thermopylae Enomoti...waaaahh!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
I apologize, Mash. Just as you said, he hasn't been mutated. He's just bad with ghosts, it seems. Our innocent, little King Leonidas.  
  
**Mash:**   
...Right.  
It's a sad business, being a Heroic Spirit, Doctor...  
  
## 7th Floor, Room No.4  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Oh, new guests?  
Don't be shy. Come in. I'm not going to eat you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I've seen this...in Ikebukuro!  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou.  
  
**Mash:**   
I know what you're trying to say, Senpai, but that's not the same thing. Also, I heard rappers are a thing of the past!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I've seen him in a commercial!  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Oh? You know of my work, kid!?  
Then I definitely hafta treat you nice!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Still... I can't believe we're seeing Cú Chulainn here, Senpai.  
  
**Mash:**   
Like Leonidas, I don't think he's a Heroic Spirit that should be here in this apartment.  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Mm? What, you know my True Name?  
Then there is no need to hide my face either.  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
There. I was suffocating under that hood.  
Also far too formal when I am gambling.  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
So sit, honored guests.  
Which game do you desire?  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Cards? Dice? Roulette?  
Or a rousing game of backgammon?  
  
**Mash:**   
...Gambling... D-don't tell me...  
  
**Mash:**   
Shiki! What's the complaint from the neighborhood residents!?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
“It's noisy with zombies milling around after midnight.  
They appear to be bawling and with no clothes on,” it says.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Well, typical apartment gambling.  
No problem. That's a matter that requires an arrest.  
  
**Mash:**   
Cú Chulainn, don't tell me you're...  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I'm afraid so. I had too much free time, so my hobby became extreme and I began running a casino☆  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I mean, I am Caster class, after all. When I hold this staff, manipulating the dice is just too easy...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's illegal gambling! You're using your precious Druid abilities to load some dice!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This is like in Ikebukuro...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He looked so cool in the commercial...  
  
---  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Ah... Oh, that? To be honest, that was the cause...  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
It is not as if I settled here of my own volition. I got into a quarrel with my mentor.  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I can't leave just yet. When I told her, “Act your age,” I was hit with the full force of her fury.  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
I tell you, I haven't mixed it up with my mentor like that since I was her disciple in the Land of Shadows!  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
There was also Fergus, Ferdia, and I believe 20 others.  
My mentor announced it out of the blue. As a final test.  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
“All of you, slay me right now. If you cannot, you will die.  
For I am going to slaughter the lot of you.”  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
That's what she said. I suppose it was to weed out the weaker warriors, but I wish she hadn't been that serious.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Tell me about it. I hate her Stun.  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Oh, you've fought her before somewhere?! What a misfortune!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So, did you win then?  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
If we hadn't, neither Uncle Fergus, Ferdia nor I would have been around to become Heroic Spirits.  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
It took all of us.  
Normally, she would have beaten us.  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
But the thing is, afterwards...  
She easily wiped us out...  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Don't tell anyone I told you this, understand?  
That woman hides one side of her true character.  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
“You have done well. You fools have finally become half-fledged warriors. But... I still have one stage of transformation left.”  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
That's what she said before sending us flying.  
I'm telling you, we were like scraps of paper.  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
...And this time was like a reenactment of that.  
She laid waste to my Wicker Man.  
  
---  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Long story short, I lost to my mentor and was imprisoned here.  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
She told me to think about what I did for a while. Treating me like the monkey in that story...  
  
**Mash:**   
You mean China's famous story of the Five Elements Mountain, with the Monkey King?  
  
**Mash:**   
I sympathize with your situation,  
Cú Chulainn, but I think you're also to blame.  
  
**Mash:**   
You should never casually bring up a woman's age. Especially if she cares about what people think of her.  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
That is a fine warning!  
One that'll stick, as it was given by a true beauty!  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
What do you say we set aside the gambling and turn to another pursuit? My bedroom door is wide open to young beauties!  
  
**Fou:**   
Kyuu, fouuu!  
  
**???:**  
Mm. My thoughts exactly, Fou. “A lazy warrior should have it cut off and cauterized by yon pike.”  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Yikes!  
  
**Mash:**   
Y-you're Mistress Scáthach!?  
  
**???:**  
I am not the strongest, most beautiful warrior of Celtic legend, but only a nameless Kunoichi who skulks in the darkness.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, this is Japan. I suppose it's to be expected. Then, you are welcome here. We'll cooperate with you however we can.  
  
**???:**  
I am grateful. Die, Cú Chulainn!  
Die two or three times a day!  
  
**Cú Chulainn:**   
What!? Why!? Who are you!?  
There is no Cú Chulainn here!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? That was a disguise!  
  
---  
  
## 8th Floor, Room No.1  
  
**Mash:**   
T-This is... I wouldn't even call this strange anymore, Senpai.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, let's go home.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Huh? I thought I just saw something.  
  
---  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
This isn't even a room to begin with.  
This is like it's from a totally different world.  
  
**Nobunaga:**   
I am impressed you have found your way here, my elite soldiers! I am The Demon King of the Sixth Heaven!  
  
**Mash:**   
Nobunaga!? Or, more importantly, this room...  
&mdash;Is this even a room!?  
  
**Nobunaga:**   
So you've noticed... Mas... No, Boobie Servant!  
  
**Mash:**   
My name is Mash Kyrielight! I shouldn't have to remind you!  
  
**Nobunaga:**   
Long story short, basically because of my curse, even this beautiful one bedroom apartment...  
  
**Nobunaga:**   
...that's close to the station, has cheap rent, looks like a fashionable place for a noble to live in...  
  
**Nobunaga:**   
...would turn into a different dimension like that Flame-something City.  
  
**Mash:**   
Nobunaga's curse... I guess her unfulfilled dream and early death at Honnoji has turned into a form of grudge and...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It can't be helped...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The whole thing was burned to the ground...  
  
---  
  
**Nobunaga:**   
Yes, I didn't even get worker's comp for that...  
But, that's not really important.  
  
**Mash:**   
I guess we can agree that this is not important...  
Oh, please continue.  
  
**Nobbu:**   
What infuriates me...is Okita! Yes, Okita! I will cut that girl down! She was supposed to make me look better!  
  
**Nobbu:**   
“Oh my, cute Okita here has gathered a whole lot of Friend Points today.”  
  
**Nobbu:**   
“Speaking of Friend Points, how many do you have Nob... Oh...”  
  
**Nobbu:**   
She will pick a fight with me like that! Besides, during GUDAGUDA Honnoji,  
  
**Nobbu:**   
all of you people were praising me left and right like “Nobbu so cute! Nobbu is the best! Nobbuuuuuu!”  
  
**Nobbu:**   
Now what? The event is finished so you're done with me? You only need Okita now?  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes! She was a great help to both Senpai and myself! Although I do feel bad for Mistress Scáthach a little bit.  
  
**Nobbu:**   
Et tu, Mash? Fine, in that case I will wait no longer!  
  
**Nobbu:**   
I have turned this apartment into a different dimension, and thus creating a new event by Nobbu, to Nobbu, for Nobbu!  
  
**Nobbu:**   
The new event will be titled “the Garden of Nobbu”! Wahahahahahahaha, prepare yourselves!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...So, who the heck is this?  
  
**Nobbu:**   
Curse you! We have never met before! I am the noobie Heroic Spirit Nobbu! Nice to meet you!  
  
**--BATTLE-**  
  
**Nobbu:**   
...Heh, compare to everything under heaven, a man's life of fifty years is nothing but a vain dream like this event.  
  
**Nobbu:**   
I, the obsessed Demon King, will make my exit... Farewell, Mas... I mean, Boobie Servant.  
  
**Mash:**   
Enough of that, I said!  
  
**Nobbu:**   
Do your best to gather them points...  
Don't forget to exchange the Ascension materials...  
  
**Nobbu:**   
Otherwise you'll get stuck on an awkward level... Well... I suppose...that's...inevitable...  
  
**Mash:**   
Nobunaga...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
So who the hell was that?  
A newbie sandwich board advertiser?  
  
**Okita:**   
Heh... I took down many outlaws today with my famous Sandanzuki. OKITA-SAN DAISHOURI♪  
  
**Okita:**   
Ah, I picked up some ice cream at the convenience store on the way back. What kind do you want, Nobbu?  
  
**Nobbu:**   
Green tea!  
  
**Mash:**   
Huh!?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Strawberry.  
  
**Mash:**   
You too!?  
  
## 8th Floor, Room No.4  
  
**Heroine X:**   
I'm the last tenant? I see!  
But I got a chance to appear, so I'm not complaining!  
  
**Heroine X:**   
What's that!? Is it a bird? Is it a plane?  
No, it's a Saber!  
  
**Heroine X:**   
That's right, I'm the Saber who races across the glistening etheric universe!  
  
**Heroine X:**   
The ever-popular Heroine X has once again made an emergency landing! Everyone, do you have enough Hearts&mdash;!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...We're almost done, Mash.  
  
**Mash:**   
...Right. Between her and Nobunaga, it seems time and space really are warped on this floor...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Huh? Ms. Ryougi?  
  
**Mash:**   
I know. Shiki has disappeared.  
  
---  
  
**Heroine X:**   
Mmm! Following a highly concentrated Saber signal has led me to a new Saber!  
  
**Heroine X:**   
I have nothing against you personally, but I have a quota. A quota of Sabers to fight!  
  
**Heroine X:**   
Ah, no, my mistake. That's actually karma. It's my karma. That's cool. I'm a character ruled by fate.  
  
**Mash:**   
U-Um, X? I like how lively you are, always hyper with that tension of yours but...  
  
**Mash:**   
But I don't think we have a Saber class here.  
Shiki is Assassin class&mdash;  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Come now, what are you two doing?  
You'd better get ready for a fight.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
A being from outer space&mdash; Oh my, that's so rare. Let's see what she can do before I get tired of her.  
  
**Heroine X:**   
Huh? Who's this in a kimono with a Japanese sword? She's so serious and menacing...  
  
**Heroine X:**   
I have a feeling she will ignore all rules of the Cosmo Dimension (comedy characters don't die) and straight up kill me...  
  
**Heroine X:**   
All right, I apologize. I had the wrong person!  
Can you just let me go home?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
My! You're not only courageous, but refined.  
This makes me want to play with you even more.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Would you do me the favor of a battle, traveler? Despite my appearance, I'm good at slashing the sign of a cross.  
  
**Heroine X:**   
All right, emergency warp failed!  
Do I only have myself to blame for this!?  
  
**Heroine X:**   
In that case, I'll do it!  
I'll show you the power of Altrium!  
  
**--BATTLE-**  
  
**Heroine X:**   
I can't believe this... Now that I look closely, this Saber here also emits Altrium...  
  
**Heroine X:**   
But I didn't lose, okay!?  
Unless I lose to a blonde Saber, it doesn't count!  
  
**Heroine X:**   
Then the next time we meet, it shall be as friends! Please serve me traditional New Year's dishes then!  
  
**Mash:**   
Heroine X has successfully retreated.  
  
**Mash:**   
I just wish she hadn't crash-landed her spaceship into the apartment, Senpai.  
  
**G：Ryougi Shiki:**   
I'm disappointed. My one chance to slash an opponent from the stars. Next time, I'll start by cutting off that strain of hair on her head.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's basically telling X to die.  
  
**G：Ryougi Shiki:**   
Yes. That is what I meant.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So is Shiki going to grow one as well?  
  
**G：Ryougi Shiki:**   
Really? In that case... I guess it wouldn't be a good idea to cut that off, right?  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? What's going on?  
I was just taking a little bathroom break. What'd I miss?  
  
**Mash:**   
Heroine X, whom we've talked about before, was here, Doctor.  
  
**Mash:**   
Shiki's personality changed and... Huh?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Owww... I stubbed my toe on the corner of this drawer...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Mm? What, the last room is empty? Then I guess our investigation is finished, Fujimaru.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Good work. Thanks to you, my work here is done.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
All of the Servants who had grievances have been removed, so you can search the building at your leisure.  
  
**Mash:**   
You heard her. Good job helping to remove the Servants, Senpai.  
  
**Mash:**   
We still have time, so why don't we search this building a little more?  
  
## The Boundary of Dawn  
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai, there's a door. We didn't see one before when we were here.  
  
**Mash:**   
An emergency exit... It appears to be a door leading to the roof. Come to think of it...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Fou found a strange key, right? I see. So finally we get to meet the mastermind behind all this.  
  
**Mash:**   
...I knew it. Mephisto only became known as such after the construction of this apartment building.  
  
**Mash:**   
Although Mephisto brought the Servants here,  
he had nothing to do with their so-called mutations.  
  
**Mash:**   
So&mdash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Oh. Then that black-shrouded guy should be there.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well, why don't we go interrupt his so-called work?  
  
---  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
That's the spirit, Master!  
That's how a leader needs to act.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Let's use the key.  
Who knows what's going to come out of here.  
  
**Mash:**   
The sky feels close&mdash; You wouldn't be able to tell just from looking at the building.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
It's well constructed. It reminds me of the roof on the Fujou Building.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...It'll be dawn soon. Hey, you in black over there. Did your so-called “work” end?  
  
**???:**  
As if it would end. My grudge shall never fade away, ever.  
  
**???:**  
I suppose this tower will disappear.  
It will return to nothingness by your hands.  
  
**???:**  
But my work is not done yet. The island of despair. The tower of incarceration. The castle of treasures.  
  
**???:**  
Until I remember it all, I shall never give up.  
  
**Mash:**   
Master, prepare for battle!  
I have confirmed the presence of an enemy Servant.  
  
**Mash:**   
That is a Heroic Spirit who should not exist in this world!  
  
**???:**  
&mdash;Keh.  
Hahahahahahahahahaha!  
  
**???:**  
A Heroic Spirit who should not exist in this world, you say! You should have your tongue burned out for such lies, Demi-Servant!  
  
**???:**  
Eventually you will know Heroic Spirits and spirits of the dead are the same thing. We are all curses fallen into the shadow of this world.  
  
**Mash:**   
Is that... The massive ghost from before!?  
So there was another one!  
  
**???:**  
No, we simply did not disappear. Curses don't disappear.  
  
**???:**  
This is a system of curses that is already complete. This is the debt to humanity that the King of Mages has thrust upon me.  
  
**???:**  
As long as others exist, there will be both resentment and killing. The hatred of those sacrificed are my nourishment.  
  
**???:**  
This is eternal. A miserable hell that goes on forever.  
  
**???:**  
The pious would likely worship me as a god of the greatest depths&mdash; An indestructible phenomenon immune to death.  
  
**Mash:**   
...It has far more magical energy than last time, Master! It really does...seem to increase its resentment every time you defeat it.  
  
**Mash:**   
If it keeps increasing at this rate&mdash;  
we will not be able to kill that monster&mdash;  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
&mdash;We can kill it.  
If it's alive, we will kill it.  
  
**???:**  
&mdash;Oh, really? Are you capable of destroying an indestructible phenomenon?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Even if something exists for millions of years, it's only the false impression of eternal youth that humans project on it.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
But all things possess the seed of destruction. There is nothing in the universe that is immutable for eternity.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Get lost, vengeful demon.  
No matter how long or great a life is&mdash;  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
As long as it has an end, I won't hesitate to kill even a god!  
  
**???:**  
Hah!  
Very well then. Show me, blasphemer!  
  
**???:**  
See if you can deny the evil in human beings!  
Prove that there is nothing that can exist for eternity!  
  
**--BATTLE-**  
  
**Mash:**   
The giant enemy ghost has disappeared!  
All that's left is that Servant... Ah.  
  
**Mash:**   
The Servant is fleeing!  
But, in the direction of&mdash;!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
The edge of the roof...does he intend to get away by jumping off!? Not a smart way to escape!  
  
**Mash:**   
Shiki!? If you charge with that momentum, both of you will...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Do you intend to kill him even if you end up plummeting to your own death? No, you have to stop now!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Spiritron reaction shows that the Servant is not actually there!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's just a shadow! Ryougi, you're the only one that's going to fall!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
With your Mystic Eyes, you might be able to kill the enemy's true body even if it's a shadow. But&mdash;  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
If you chase him, you're going to die too!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
You finally made it to Chaldea, and now you want to die with someone whose face you don't even know!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ryougi, stop!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Stay, Shiki!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh dear...She just barely stopped in time. You called out just in the nick of time, Fujimaru.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
...Hmph. I can't ignore the Master's orders. You're a lucky man.  
  
**???:**  
...You're not going to pursue me?  
  
**???:**  
If you were ready to put your life on the line, I would have shown no hesitation in accepting my fate.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
I know. I had a feeling you were that kind of guy.  
  
**???:**  
Ugh!  
  
**Mash:**   
A throwing knife!  
Shiki, were you hiding another knife!?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Yeah. In my sash. Women know a thing or two about concealed weapons.  
  
**???:**  
Ugh... So those eyes of yours... They'll even “kill” a shadow reflected on the water's surface.  
  
**???:**  
You perceive even inanimate things as living. Even phantoms are not immune to death. It seems my work ends here.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Spiritron reaction is fading...  
No, wait! The dark Servant!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Why did you create this kind of place!?  
Who asked you to do this!?  
  
**???:**  
It's obvious. Surely you understand.  
It's the one that you regard as your enemy.  
  
**???:**  
He boasted that this tower could become a new Singularity. However&mdash;  
  
**???:**  
My goal differs from his.  
  
**???:**  
My life is fueled by my thirst for vengeance.  
He differs from me on a fundamental level.  
  
**???:**  
Why should I lend a hand to someone who holds no grudge? That's why I rejected his offer.  
  
**???:**  
True to my nature, I gave other Servants the opportunity to take revenge.  
  
**???:**  
“Oh Tiger, howl with all the fury of a tiger.  
The time has come to devour your prey.”  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
He held no grudge... What does that mean? I'm confused... Well then, what is the point of incinerating mankind's history?  
  
**???:**  
Why don't you find the answer yourselves?  
I have no interest in the matter.  
  
**Mash:**   
...Master.  
The enemy Servant will disappear.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Please, just tell me who you are!  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
I'm not obligated to say anything.  
  
**???:**  
...Hmph. But, if you insist...  
The only thing I have to say is this.  
  
**???:**  
“Attendre et espérer...” Wait and hope.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
...It is finally over. The mastermind who was gathering all the ghosts is finally gone.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
This apartment will return to its incinerated history... The long night will finally end.  
  
**Mash:**   
That's good news, but...  
We still have no idea who that Servant was.  
  
**Mash:**   
He made it sound like he was our enemy...  
I wonder if we will have to fight again someday?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Who knows? One victory might be all that's needed for that type of guy. He might turn out to be an  unexpectedly trustworthy ally.  
  
**Mash:**   
Really?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
That's right. Mash, do you know why human beings take revenge on others?  
  
**Mash:**   
N-No. I can't quite recall at the moment the motivation behind the act of revenge...  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
It's simple. A human being holds a grudge when they have been betrayed by someone they love. If the other person is someone they don't care about, they would be indifferent.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
So... Maybe that guy in black actually loves humanity on a fundamental level?  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
The one born from hatred speaks of love,  
and the one born from love speaks of hatred.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
That's the type of guy he is, I'm sure.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes. Perhaps we'll encounter him again someday. For now, let's hope that we have solved this case once and for all.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm glad we were able to solve the case!  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou!  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Yeah. The investigation did take a lot of legwork. Your perseverance exceeded my expectations.  
  
**Ryougi Shiki:**   
Come to my house if you lose your job as a Master. We...have a detective, so we'll hire you as an assistant.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Dr. Roman, don't tell me it's you!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm, I don't know about that. If I can remote control someone from here, I think I can be a lot more useful to you guys.  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyway, good work, everyone. You were all able to persevere and continue the search until the end.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
There's nothing left to do now, and the distortion in the coordinates should eventually disappear.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'll be waiting for all of you in Chaldea.  
The Case of Ogawa Heim has come to a close!
