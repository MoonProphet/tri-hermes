# Chocolate Lady's Commotion  
  
## Prologue: Chocolate Flavored Great Escape  
   
&ndash;Sweet, melting, and bitter.  
&ndash;I guess chocolate is the flavor of love.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Mas&ndash;  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
&ndash;ter   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Today is Valentine's Day, Master.  
Kiyohime, unworthy me, has made chocolate.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
To be precise, I “became” chocolate rather than made it.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
If I can become a dragon by holding on to my feelings for a thousand years, becoming a chocolate is rather simple.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Come!  
I will be the personification of that cheesy tagline!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I will melt in your mouth&ndash;  
but definitely not...in...your...hand☆  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
By the way, if I transform my entire body in chocolate,  
I would be roughly 240,000 calories♪  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You can cut me into pieces and eat me up later if you want to.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That would be a crime!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What is this, a dream?  
  
  
---  
   
**???:**  
Well, well, I wonder what kind of nightmare you witnessed?  
  
   
**???:**  
Perhaps something like “The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind?”  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, Ms. K...  
   
**???:**  
Oh, I see.  
It is almost Valentine's Day.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can't remember...  
   
**???:**  
A nightmare so terrible you couldn't even remember, I see.  
  
   
**???:**  
But, if it's a nightmare that can even torture our Master,  
I have no doubt its content is related to Ms. K.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...That aside... Hello, my Master!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I, Shakespeare, the most renowned literary writer in the world, have come to destroy your golden slumber!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Why? You may ask.  
No reason, I am simply here to wake you up.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
From you? That's rare.  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I am sure you'd think that way. After all, Lady Mash is the usually the one to wake you up.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Unfortunately, as you may be aware, she's battling with chocolate at the moment.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where's Mash?  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Well, well, have you forgotten, Master?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
All of the female Servants, including her, are spending all their time on chocolate.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Some of them... Like Lady Artemis, for example, is making the chocolate for their true love.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Lady Mata Hari, Lady Antoinette, and Lady Boudica seem to be making chocolate for everybody.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I guess you could call those types of chocolate, friendship chocolate.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Also, although it's only my own speculation, I have an eerie feeling about what they might get in return on White Day, except Lady Boudica.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I mean, the majority of male Servants probably never received a chocolate in their life, and glare at the world with eyes that look like the Tibetan Fox.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Well, there are also Servants who don't care much about this kind of occasion, but that's that.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
“It (Jealousy) is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on.”  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...That's the saying, no?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Would they be happy to get one from me?  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Ohhh, Master's handmade chocolate!  
That would make any Servant happy!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Servants are emotional entities. If they get chocolate from you, you can expect them to work extra hard.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
In that case, let's go join the ladies and make some chocolate with them!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Hmm, someone appears to be running around the halls.  
I urge you to exercise care, Master.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wh-What's going on?  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Wh-What's happening?  
An attack on Chaldea?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
They seem to have run into the simulator room.  
Shall we pursue them?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes!  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Understood!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Well, well, Master! I shall be rooting for you, so please go finish this quickly!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Hmm, that was some good exercise, wasn't it Master?  
However, what is this Servant?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
It looks like a Shadow Servant, but with a much paler color...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
More than anything&ndash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This...smells like chocolate...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This... sweet fragrance...  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Yes, that's it!  
I know what they are now&ndash;  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Where? Where is it?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...Oh? The adorable, flustered thing over there is...  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Oh my, Master. Say, did you happen to see a chocolate sprinting around here?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...What did you say?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
A chocolate I said. I am not sure what happened but...  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
...the chocolate I melted in a bain-marie​ started to fuse together, took human form, and all of a sudden ran away.  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
It sure is mysterious, isn't it?  
What should we do, Master?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Oh... Chocolate...  
ran...away...you say!?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
In other words, let's call the entities we've just met “Choco-Servants!”  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Now what do I do... I put some a secret spell on it that allows it to turn into a jewel.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's way too magical...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What kind of alchemist are you?  
  
  
---  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Hehehe, if you pour enough love into your chocolate,  
it's only natural for it to do that.  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Please be sure to remember that because it's very important, Master♪  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
This has turned into an extremely fascinating event, Master!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
But please rest assured, Master.  
I thought something like this might happen!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Prepare for the impossible!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I have called upon some Servants with unusual senses of smell to track down those chocolates.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Let's use their scarily keen senses of smell derived from their unpopulari... I mean jealousy, and take back those chocolates!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're behind this aren't you!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I know what your final Ascension looks like...  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Hahahaha, you sure like to jest, Master!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...If I were behind this commotion, I would surely make the chocolate escape with more drama, more tragedy!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Therefore, I promise I am only acting out of the kindness in my heart.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Ah, I can see distrust in my Master's eyes. Heh heh, I guess my legacy can be both good and evil at times!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ahhh, heaters and blankets are the best on a cold day like this... Good, it feels so good...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I know I have a lot to do, but snuggling in this blanket next to a heater somehow makes me feel like everything will be all right.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Truly, this just feels too good...  
No wonder humanity has fallen...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Pardon me for interrupting your self-degenerating fantasy, but you really have to stop being useless when we need you.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ouch, that hurts! That brought me back to reality! Can you stop with the kind of insults that cuts you to the core?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, what? Shakespeare?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Rayshift preparation?  
Chocolate? Escape? Oh, hold on a moment.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, wait a minute. What's going on?  
Eh, eh, eh&ndash;!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
At least let me fulfill my role as the exposition guy&ndash;!  
  
   
## Section 1: Chocolate Domination  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
NORMIES EXPLODE!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
ARGH!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What was that?  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
An extraordinary comedian.  
No wonder he rampaged across Okeanos.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
B-Blackbeard?  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Hahaha, don't worry, Master.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
There's an example of someone who you think might be powerful, but he's actually just another sandbag for you to practice your new moves on.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Either way, he's no threat to us.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
What? I am! I am a serious threat!  
By the way, what was that just now, Master?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I almost became some shining particles and disappeared along with some touching BGM!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
ALL OF AMERICA WAS SHOOK!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Rest assured, Lord Blackbeard.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
You are like a minor character who randomly dies off in the background during a touching scene in some war flick.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
You are but a candle that will go out at any moment, so there's no time for BGM.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
That's mean!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
But, blowing someone up without warning!  
I see you are fit to be a pirate!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Yes, it's only natural for a pirate to ambush someone!  
But it pisses me off when it's done to me!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
IT PISSES   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
ME OFF   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Now that you have intentionally pissed me off,  
you'll learn the extent of my wrath!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
What are you saying, Lord Blackbeard?  
That explosion was not by me or Master.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
So then, who on Earth would dare to blow up Blackbeard?!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Don't tell me one of ya good-for-nothings is trying to kill me and take my spot!  
  
   
**Underling:**   
It's not us, Captain!  
Also, no one could replace ya.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
That is correct, Lord Blackbeard!  
How can you suspect us without proof?!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Y-You...are absolutely right.  
I am sorry... Well, Mista Mephisto...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...Wait, hold on a minute.  
Why are you riding on my boat?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Huh? Well you said “explode” out loud like that, so it's only fair for a explosive Servant like me blow you up, right?  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
I mean, even if you'd told me not to do it,  
it's a clown's job to go ahead and do it anyway, no?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
AARRGH! So you were the one!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
By the way, Lord Blackbeard.  
Are you hiding any chocolate?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
You seem to give off a cacao-like smell.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Chocolate...you say?  
N-No way, I have no idea what are you talking about!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I insist that I am innocent!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay, guilty. You have no right to remain silent.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okay, arrest him. No need for a lawyer.  
  
  
---  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Shit! I have no rights, you say!  
But, I haven't done anything&ndash;!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
In that case, I can only prove my innocence through sheer strength! Brute force = Freedom! That's the way of the Voyager of the Storm!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Oh, did someone mention a fight?  
Then please allow me to participate, too.  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
What? “Don't come?” “Don't do it?”  
The more you say that to me the more I want to join!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Hee hee hee hee hee!  
But, having Master as my opponent is so very painful!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
In any case, Valentine's Day is a day no normies should have! Especially in a Far East city called Harajuku!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
I, Mephistopheles, shall partake in this annual event of getting rid of normies! Oh this is so much fun!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
UGH!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
BLACKBEEEARD!  
  
  
---  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Somehow, I am not feeling the motivation in that call, Master! D-Damn... I-I can't be defeated here, not yet...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
M-Mista!  
Now is the time for us to rely on you!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Please rain down punishment on this normie of a Master!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Huh, so you are calling Hektor to help you like you did in the Main Chapter? But if anything, that guy is actually pretty popular...  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Chocolate is tyranny.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
WHO THE HECK DID YOU CALL?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okay, this is no joke right now!  
  
  
---  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
WAH HAH HAH! YES!  
Valentine's Day is the ultimate tyranny!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Mista Spartacus is most motivated on this day!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Pour our love into chocolate?  
The most important day for any girl?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
WHAT A LOAD OF HORSE SHIT! A BIG STEAMING PILE OF SHIT! IT'S TYRANNY! TYRANNY I SAY!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You've totally made it worse.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You already turn people off, and now...  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
These kinds of people are the ones that break down on Valentine's Day. This is truly entertaining!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
It goes something like this,  
“I will be brief: your noble son is mad.”  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
You know, just the thought of putting love or hate into desserts is wrong! Don't you think so, Master?!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's not a bad way to show people your affection.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There's no right or wrong in expressing your emotions.  
  
  
---  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
RIGHTEOUSNESS BEAAAAAAAM!?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Ugh... As expected of my Master,  
I can't even think of a comeback...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
While I, Blackbeard, am lucky to be summoned by Master, this is where our opinions differ.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
And so, Mista Spartacus!  
This Master here is a tyrant! An oppressor!  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Then I shall rebel against such tyranny.  
Master, I will be the one to protect those chocolates!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Let me help too!  
Other Servants, besides me, are strong, you know!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Spartacus:**   
I've failed... (ka-thud)  
Master, please keep the tyranny moderate...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
MISTA NO-TYRANNY&mdash;!  
My ambition has been crushed...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I was about to mold the Choco-Servants into Mash-chan,  
Euryale-chan, Atalante-chan, Artemis-chan...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Mata Hari-chan, Boudica-chan, Kiyohi...  
maybe not her, that idea scares me.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I was going to have all kinds of fun with them...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Th-That's... Terrible!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Drake, get this guy!  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Hmmm... Master, Master!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I counted the Choco-Servants here, it seems we're still missing a few.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
It seems there are others who took chocolates during this whole commotion!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Now this is getting even more interesting!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You are having too much fun with this!  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Of course I am! I am good with writing tragedies, but comedies like this that can help the audience relax are the best.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you really NOT the mastermind?  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...Of course not!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I have nothing to hide, Master.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
So please stop questioning me like that just because I put a “...” in front of my answer.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
For I am super innocent.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Hehehehehe. Don't think you've won here. Soon you will realize I, Blackbeard, am the most powerful of the Four Kings...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
For I will come back and annoy you till you choke!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks for that discouraging remark!  
  
  
---  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Now I will take my leave!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
In the future, I will show up like a ghost in the sky and give you encouraging words!  
  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Well in that case, here, take this bomb. Hehe.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Oh Mista Mephisto.  
Thank you for the gif...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...  
...I don't need this!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Yooooooooo!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Chocolate is...tyranny...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Master, it seems with the blue sky in the background, anybody can look encouraging.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I wonder...  
  
  
---  
   
## Section 2: Mother, Drama, and Chocolate  
   
**Emiya:**   
...  
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Anything you want to say?  
  
  
---  
   
**Emiya:**   
Wait, hold on, Master.  
I know how you feel, but please listen to me.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Due to my special nature, I am familiar with modern events such as Valentine's Day.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Therefore, shouldn't you view my actions as a way to remove any elements that might cause you trouble?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
That's why they call you the most overprotective Servant in Chaldea. We understand your motives now, but can you share the details with us?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I object to that overprotective statement...  
But fine, I'll ignore that for now.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Master. The people trying to send you chocolates are not normal humans.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
That's right&ndash; They are Servants, heroes of the past! They are a group of people abnormal in all kinds of ways.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Capability, mentality, skill, and berserk level, they are the best in almost everything.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
There's no way they would simply make some chocolate, send it to you, and just end it there.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I am certain. Something bad will happen to you.  
Without a doubt, it'll be GG for you!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
To stop my Master from walking into a minefield, it's obviously my duty as a Servant&mdash;  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
No, my duty as a friend who has a heart. I understand the consequences greatly. I had lady issues, too!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
As I thought, you're an overprotective Servant.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Hmm. My words alone are not enough to convince you?  
I thought as much, so I brought over a special guest.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Hmm, a guest, you say? A guest who has gone through multiple lady troubles... That can only be...  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Chocolate is dangerous, Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're... T-Too convincing!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Ahh yes, I believe you...

**Shakespeare:**   
I know right?  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
That's very good!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
I didn't think too much and accepted some chocolate during a certain Holy Grail War! Then an intense confrontation unfolded right in front of me!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
I could have stopped it if it was just a fistfight.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
But there's no way I could stop two people from stabbing each other with words while smiling.  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
What awaited me was endless stomach ulcers...  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Chocolate is dangerous, Master.  
It will mislead people!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Thanks, beautiful, young warrior.  
I really appreciate your life lesson.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Well, meditate on the wisdom of pioneers like this and be patient.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Master. Don't forget that the future of mankind depends on you.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But, everyone gets sulky without chocolate, right?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I feel like it's better to receive some.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Oh boy. It seems we can't convince you.  
In that case, we will stop you with brute force.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Kill one to save a hundred&mdash; I hate that idea,  
but I will believe it to be the absolute justice in this case!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
That's right, unknown Archer!  
For an Archer Class we sure do think alike!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Master! Even if I, Diarmuid, must point my blade at the one I serve&ndash;  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
I will spill blood for the sake of my Master!  
That is the sure way to reduce casualties!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Hahahahaha! I guess that's what happens!  
All right, let's do it Master!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Emiya:**   
Ugh, I guess this is the end...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Your idea is noble but tainted by evil thoughts.  
I believe that's why you lost.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I don't remember having those evil thoughts&ndash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What do you mean?  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
If Lord Emiya feels like it, he can effortlessly make a chocolate.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
In the event that Master does not receive chocolate from anyone... Since Master would look bad if that happened...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
He was going to say “You might not want one from your guardian, but here” and then give you a chocolate.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
That was the kind of beautiful ending he was going for.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The feeling of not receiving anything,  
I... I understand that feeling all too well...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I made this chocolate using leftover ingredients, but I thought it would be better than nothing...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mom's chocolate...  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
It's the last insurance on Valentine's Day.  
Well, in Master's case, there is Ms. K.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yay! Chocolate!  
   
**Emiya:**   
I see, it makes me happy that you like it...  
But I guess that's just me being nosy...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...By the way, Lord Emiya.  
Do you know that Red Saber over there?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Red Saber?  
I don't remember calling her here&ndash;  
  
   
**???:**  
IT'S ME!  
  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Caesar:**   
IT'S ME!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...I think you have transcended the joke and became the stereotype. ...Red Saber?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
As usual, is this part of your scheme?  
Just how convenient can you get?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I had no choice, nom nom.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Chocolate is the treasure of calories, nom.  
When you say calories, it can only be me, nom.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Well, there is a possibility that Altera will show up, but right now she's busy making chocolate...  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
...while mumbling “Chocolate is civilization... Wait... Is it?”  
So I left her alone.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
If I try to deceiv... I mean persuade her, she'll fire beams at me! No questions asked!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I guess power is justice...  
   
**Caesar:**   
NO MORE VIOLENCE! Shouldn't we make that into a slogan and post it everywhere in Chaldea?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's the best approach...  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
The pen is mightier than the sword but the sword is quicker than the pen.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Unless you can see that... Remember, beams, no questions asked.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Caesar:**   
Well, although it feels like I am just a pawn in the hands of the mastermind, it doesn't matter since chocolate is delicious. It's fine!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The mastermind!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Caesar:**   
That's right, the mastermind!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
You see, even without relying on someone great like me, I'm sure you can tell there's a Servant that appeared recently...  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
...that will make you think “Can't we just blame everything on this guy?”  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...Ah yes. That guy.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
The kind that would make you say “It's for the best...” with a sorrowful expression.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
That one that feels like “That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.”  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Now go, go chase that person down!  
I am going to stay here and enjoy more cocoa.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Hmm, sweet. This is good poison.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No more chocolate!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Any more calories will be dangerous for you!  
  
  
---  
   
**Caesar:**   
Nom nom nom nom nom...  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I know, I know, but&ndash;  
Can't stop, won't stop!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Well, Emiya! Diarmuid!  
Let's show them the power of the Three Knights Class!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Hold on. Are you dragging me in?  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
As I've said, chocolate is dangerous, Master!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Caesar:**   
All right, all right! I've lost!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
...But, I've burnt up all of the calories in those chocolates with this fight, right?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
A Servant's physique doesn't change, you know...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Even if by some skill you may change your physique,  
this amount of exercise won't do a thing.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
A healthy diet can be adopted only after leading a regimented life, getting proper exercise, and appropriate food.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Hmm, now that we're at it.  
Let me fix that unhealthy body of yours.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Er, hold on.  
Why are you grabbing my hand?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Fuyuki Citizens' Marathon Flame Course,  
I will have you join me as well! Ready... BOOM!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Boom! Did you just say “Boom?” Just how forceful can you be? I don't even have time to comment!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
But, please wait! Physical labor does not fit my image...  
Oh, I can feel the burn! My fat is burning!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Ow, this hurts!  
Help me, Diarmuid! At least ready the chariot!  
  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Friendship between two men... How wonderful!  
Please let me join you as well!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
You too, Diarmuid!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A witty remark would do now...  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
They will be fine. Lord Caesar's true quality comes out after he dies. At least that's the way I've written about him.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...Are we still missing some chocolates? Aren't you curious about the “mastermind” Lord Caesar mentioned?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
However, haste makes waste.  
Let's call it a day!  
  
   
## Section 3: That is Also Me  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Ah, how can this be? It's sad, but all of this is part of my plan&mdash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I knew that.  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
As expected of my Master...  
I am impressed that you noticed.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Ah, yes.  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
As expected of my Master... That calmness is fit for someone who will save the world.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
We're here... Lord Caesar incites people with his words,  
Lord Hohenheim changes people with his attitude.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Please be careful, Master.  
Mages are like an author's deadline.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
If you believe without thinking, you will pay for it later.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
A deadline of Friday EOD means it's okay by Monday morning. Depending on the situation, you can even turn it in by Monday night!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see, you can't trust him!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Aren't you embarrassed for saying that?  
  
  
---  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
&ndash;Wait, wait a minute.  
Please listen to me first.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
What is chocolate anyway, Master?  
That's right, it's a snack made from cocoa beans.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
With its abundant sugar, chocolate is sweet and the calories and fat are also overpowering.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...Currently, there are countless female Servants in Chaldea.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
They give away chocolates, and if Master eats all of them, it wouldn't be good for Master's health.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
However, simply destroying the chocolates won't do&ndash;  
They will simply make more on the spot.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Besides, if I do that, they'll kill me.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I know right...  
  
  
---  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
However, Holy Chocolate War, where people fight over chocolates... I can't let that happen either.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
The world must be forever peaceful and serene.  
That's when I finally came up with my idea.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
That's right, all I need to do is to eliminate chocolate as an ingredient.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Indeed!  
How exceedingly logical of you!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This is a little bit extreme, right?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Isn't this way of thinking a bit dangerous?  
  
  
---  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
A mage like me even agonizes over the question if I should use spells like the ones you see in fairytales.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...Well, I thought it would be good to fulfill a girl's wish in the process.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A girl?  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Sorry, I talk too much.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Therefore, I don't regret anything.  
I'll do the same thing over and over again.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Whose wish did you grant?  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
I cannot reveal that.  
Revealing a girl's secret is the act of an evil man.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
It's incredibly convincing when you say that, you know!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
&ndash;Now, I think we have reached a mutual understanding... That our opinions will reach an agreement.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
So there is only one thing to do.  
With this magical sword of Paracelsus&ndash;  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
I will persuade (brainwash) you.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did you just say brainwash?  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
That's sad... I think you might've misheard.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What was that in the parentheses?  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Are you saying that's my true intention?  
I wonder what you mean by that?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
In any case, cooking is just mixing ingredients.  
If it's mixing stuff, nothing beats alchemy.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
I have my own opinion regarding chocolate making.  
I will prove the justice in my plan through this fight!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...I've lost...  
However... I'm sad...  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
When I think about how Master would walk the path of carnage...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll be all right. No problem.  
  
  
---  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...And... My heart aches just thinking about how you have to eat that idol's chocolate...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ah.  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Master... You were so preoccupied on chasing chocolates, you forgot about that, right?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
No matter what this idol makes, negative adjustment will happen and turn her creation into a mysterious substance...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
No... Before all of that.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Even if the majority of the Servants possess knowledge of chocolate, for most of them this is their first time cooking.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...It would be best to ask Lady Da Vinci for some stomach medicine beforehand.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
In case you need this... Please drink it... It's made from ancient spirit grass. If it's your stomach, it should protect it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you!  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
But... You'll lose your sense of taste...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If it's my stomach?  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
It won't protect... Your tongue...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Farewell then, Master. At the very least, please don't rob little girls of their dreams&ndash;  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Little girls' dreams, you say?  
The most fragile yet sturdy thing in this world.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Yearning for eternity and peace, it is a world where violence and barbarism are alien.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...Nonetheless, I'm fully aware it's a unrefined existence.  
Therefore we must go destroy that dream!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Having fun?  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Of course!  
The commotion this time is a tale fit to relax people.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I will do my best to fulfill my role as your buddy!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
However, Paracelsus disappeared without telling us anything about the girl, we could really use some hints.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...Huh?  
Please take a look at this, Master.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
This is...a doll, isn't it?  
Also a gigantic candy and a picture book.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...A picture book?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That means&ndash;  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
We will reveal the culprit...  
After this commercial break!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Tomorrow!  
  
  
---  
   
## Section 4: Dark, Sweet, and Evil  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Happy Halloween!?  
  
  
---  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Well, Hello, Master!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Sorry.  
It's a bit of a mess.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
But this was the most wonderfully decorated room for a tea party with the Choco-Servants...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Oh, you brought out some nostalgic decorations, didn't you?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Yes, the shining ones are always the better ones!  
Right, Uncle Shakespeare?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
The moment you hear “Uncle” from a little child, there's this sweetness and an “Oh no, I'm old!” feeling, right Master?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Well, well, anyways.  
Would you please give those Choco-Servants back to us?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Why?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
They are lifeforms based off the Valentine chocolates made by the female Servants.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
If they don't go back, the ladies won't be able to finish making their chocolates.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
No way, you can't take them!  
They will enjoy a tea party here with me.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
There are many kinds of people in Chaldea but there's nobody that will enjoy a tea party with me like this!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Jack stumbles around and disappears during the tea parties and Andersen just writes bad endings!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I even asked the Red Person to secure this wonderful tea for me...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Yes, that's right! I've tried really hard!  
I won't give them to you.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
By the way, can you reserve this room?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
It's all right.  
I think that you can just sleep with Mash, Master.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Oh...Master.  
I am at my wits' end.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
The love of a child is completely different than that of romance. A type of emotion that's different at its core.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
So what shall we do?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I want the chocolate back.  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Hmm... No, no way.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
If you insist, then I will have you join me at this tea party.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll join your tea party so...  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Oh, really?  
If you say so Master...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Okay, I will think about it if you join my tea party.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Let's begin the tea party, then.  
What's important is the pastries, tea, and picture books.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
We will eat pastries and read those books while partaking elegantly in tea&ndash;!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
M-Master, I do write stories with happy endings from time to time, but...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
A fairytale world like this sure makes me want to write a bad ending.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Stop it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No way.  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Ah, Master, it's dangerous.  
I really want to write that ending now!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Hey, my right hand, settle down!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...Oh, being an adult sure is tough.  
Even so, why do we have to become adults?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
You would be so much happier if you could just eat snacks and drink tea along with these chocolates.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oh no, something is...  
  
  
---  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Once you're at Alice's tea party, just go ahead and leave your names behind like everyone else.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Hmmm... Eternity might be too difficult.  
So at least just for the duration of Valentine's!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The chocolate...  
  
  
---  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Hehehe. I have no choice.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
If I do this, the chocolates won't get eaten, and I can enjoy the tea party.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
It's a happy ending for everyone!  
This so fun! Wonderful!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Shakespeare!  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...Oooh, you can call my name even as you're starting to forget yours!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Aren't you the best Master of this era!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A bad ending...  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Oh, you called me!  
No one writes bad endings better than me!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...If I say that, a certain boy with a blue hair might get offended, but that's that.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Shakespeare, here I go! Well, although I was drinking tea next to you until a moment ago...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Hey, don't get up all of a sudden!  
You'll spill the tea!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Oh, my apologies.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Well, not only me, but you Master Fujimaru will be in a tight spot if Valentine's is left unsettled.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Listen well, Master. Let me tell you what this looks like to a bystander if you keep enjoying this tea party.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
“From today until the end of Valentine's Day,  
I will be spending all my time with Alice only!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Not only that, I am not telling any of the other ladies about it!”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, you're the worst.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They're going to kill me for sure!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm playing with fire here!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I see you're motivated now, Master!  
Yes. It always comes down to violence.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
It's sad but inevitable. Just like water always flows to lower ground, and birds always fly towards the sky.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Yes. Inevitability.  
Every part of a bad ending is created by inevitability.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
If things stay the same, not only will Master, but even the little girl here will face a bad ending.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wh-What does that mean?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She'll have a bad ending, too?  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Heh heh, I will tell you everything when the battle is over. Let's save everyone, Master!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Ugh, so you want to fight!  
What a bad person... Fine! I don't care anymore.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Master and the uncle who only writes difficult stories, you will all be the Decapitating Bunny's prey!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
That's mean, so mean!  
Flicking my forehead actually hurts!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Now this is the end.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
FINE! But I am still not giving you the Choco-Servants!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Heh, heh, now I, Shakespeare shall tell you the cruel reality!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
You know, little girl.  
Tea parties are fun.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
If you have them together with sugar-packed tea, sugar-packed pastries, and sugar-packed chocolate...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
It will envelope you in a sweet sugary joyfulness.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Unfortunately&ndash;we must not be allowed to enjoy this forever.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Even if the most beautiful time of the year can be kept,  
there's a price to pay for enjoying anything for eternity.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
“When sorrows come, they come not in single spies, but in battalions.” That's just how it is.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Wh-What do you mean?  
Stop saying stuff that I can't understa... Ouch!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
&ndash;That's right. As the price to pay for all those sweet pastries and tea, you'll&mdash;  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...get cavities.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Nooooo!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I hear that cavities hurt like hell before dental technology was established!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
It's painful. It hurts!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
H-H-Hell... No way, that's terrible.  
B-But you know? I am a Servant!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Why yes. If you'd been eating normal candy, there's no way you'd get cavities...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
However, what if a Servant has been eating candy made from another Servant's power? What do you think will happen then?  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I-It's just your imagination. My tooth doesn't hurt at all.  
It doesn't tingle at all, it doesn't sting at all.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Tea doesn't stain my teeth when I drink it!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's so sad... So very sad.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think that's enough.  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Time for the finishing blow!  
Summon Chaldea's number one dentist!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Eh, eh, eh!?  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
YEAH!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Huh!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's a dentist!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Reasonable, I suppose?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fergus:**   
So, where's my patient?  
Ohhh, is this adorable young lady my patient?  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Come, open your mouth wide...  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Raise your hand if it hurts, OK?  
(Doesn't say it won't hurt.)  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Eeeeeeeek.  
That smile looks so scary!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Relax, young lady. With this Caladbog, AKA dental drill, any cavities will be...  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
SMASHED IN ONE SHOT!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Nooo&mdash;!  
Help, Tooth Fairy&mdash;!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Phew, it's fixed now.  
You can go home, Lord Fergus.  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Hmm. I feel guilty about threatening an innocent girl, but I can't let bad things go.  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
I will happily take on the part of the villain if my Great Spin of Heaven and Earth can be useful, HAH, HAH, HAH!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
See, I prevented a bad ending, right?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But the girl seems pretty traumatized.  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I was bluffing about 50% of the time, but it seemed to work out after all!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
After this, we will have retrieved most of the chocolates.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
We're still short on some, but you can recover those at your leisure.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Now people can get back to making their chocolates.  
I am sure the ladies (and some men) among the Servants will be happy.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Master can have an easy mind now and receive those chocolates.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I can have an ease of mind now that I have the idea necessary for the manuscript of my Valentine Anthology.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Manuscript?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Anthology?  
  
  
---  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Don't worry about it, Master!  
Servants have to enjoy themselves even during off time.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Come now, you have no time to waste on someone like me.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Master... Numerous chocolates are waiting for you!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Hehehe. Indeed this is&ndash;  
“To be or not to be, that is the question.”  
  
   
## Before the Sun Melts Away the Chocolate  
   
**Narration:**   
With all these feelings of gratitude, here is a special gift on this special day.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Even if it's not special for that person, even if it's only natural for that person.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I don't mind if this feeling of mine is one sided,  
and will never be returned.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
For I will put my whole heart and soul into this brown pastry. I hope it will be accepted.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;Now that I have completed my chocolate.  
Without any trouble that is.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I am happy that Senpai is getting a lot of chocolates.  
I am a little worried if mine will get acknowledged.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Perhaps the wrapping was too plain?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, Fou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you for the encouragement, Fou.  
I will go hand it to Senpai now.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I dropped a letter in the mail already, so Senpai should be there.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai?  
Are you there, Senpai?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Strange.  
No response.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Let's look for the exit record first...  
No exit record.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In that case, could it be!  
This is just like Christmas&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Since this is an emergency, HAH!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm charging in!  
Back me up, Fou!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
FouFou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai... I mean, Master!  
Are you okay?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Huh?  
I am sure I entered Senpai's room, but...  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Hehehe, welcome my dear.  
I welcome your rough arrival, Mash.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Just as “I” planned, Demi-servant.  
But, it's too bad.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
We were supposed to have our “loser sister” punish you if you were even a minute late.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
...I'm grateful from the bottom of my heart that you arrived right on time, Mash...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wh-what's the meaning of this?  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
I guess you don't know?  
Valentine's Day is an important event for women&mdash;  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
The same goes for you.  
So you wouldn't appreciate it if it's too simple, right?  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
A special event is necessary for a special day like this.That's why&mdash;  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Right! That's why we will hype it up for everybody!  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Only by giving the chocolate after overcoming several trials, can the bond between a Master and Servant get stronger.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
I believe the term is Misattribution of Arousal?  
It's very important to balance the tsun and dere.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
Ah, yes... Of course, my big sisters.  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
And I am really sorry, Mash.  
Those two are like that... I am sorry.  
  
   
**Stheno/Euryale:**   
I can hear you, you know? Medusa!  
I can hear you, Medusa!  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
Sorry, I am sorry, my big sisters!  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
Well... Again I am sorry for all the trouble but, please defeat us and move onward!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see. That is how it is?  
...Understood. I will accept this trial!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A special trial befits a special occasion like this...  
I accept the justification behind those words!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And&mdash; Today is the only day I can express my gratitude to Senpai!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Stheno/Euryale:**   
Nooo waaaay!  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
...What a powerful strike! An attack from the heart, 100 times more powerful than anything from my sisters!  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
We were totally defeated, Mash.  
You did a really great job.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-Thank you very much!  
You hang in there too, Medusa!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All right... Who's waiting for us at the next trial?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. I prepared myself knowing in a situation like this, there will always be second and third trials!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You know what happens twice will surely happen a third time!  
  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Jack:**   
Hey, it's Mash.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
J-Jack?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
It's a trial, please give me chocolate!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, but this is...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Please, please, please, please, please!  
Please, please, please, please, please!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou is trembling at the intense begging...  
Honestly, I'm scared too!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But, there's no way I'm handing over this chocolate!  
If you want one, go find the Doctor, Jack!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Whaaat, that's mean.  
In that case&mdash; Trick or Dead!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That event was three months ago! You need to understand that the year has begun already, please!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jack:**   
Waaahhh, that's mean, Mash!  
We just wanted some candy!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'll give you something sweet later, ok?  
So please let me through, Jack...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Really? In that case, you passed!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Thank you.  
As for the sweet, is sesame bun okay?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Er... That's the kind of stuff you eat when you're old,  
Yuck...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I feel like the Doctor just passed out from that comment, but maybe it's just my imagination.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou Fou.  
  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
&ndash;This is a trial!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh... I knew something was coming but... of course it's Kiyohime!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes, it is I, Kiyohime, who comically throws flame at events that deal with love.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Although I am really not that comical! Platonic love, seriousness, and suspense are what I was known for!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
Fou...rror?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou wanted to say “Aren't you missing horror there?”  
But let's leave that aside.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I will face your trial with everything I have.  
Let's go&mdash;  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Well, wait a little there, Mash.  
...Mash, what do you think about our Master.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I respect Senpai more than anyone!  
I take pride in being their Servant!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Not like that.  
I mean be more straightforward.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Don't you want to be bonded to that person with love and romance?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
?  
What do you mean by that?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...I see. There are no lies in those words.  
But that's that and this is this.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
My flame will be the conclusion of this trial.  
Prepare to receive it!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood.  
I will protect this chocolate!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
&ndash;Ohh, I lost.  
Is the chocolate safe?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Onward then.  
That person is waiting for you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you very much, Kiyohime!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai, Senpai, Senpai!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Inhale... Exhale...)  
...ahem, ahem.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning!  
It's Valentine's Day, Senpai!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, well...sorry for shouting.  
I don't quite understand my feelings...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-Anyway, I heard today is the day we transform our feelings of gratitude into chocolate and give them away.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's why, here you go. It's not much, but it would make me happy if it nourishes you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? Why am I armed, you ask?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well... Da Vinci taught me a lot of stuff beforehand, so...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So I turned into my Servant form to psyche myself up for this...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-Anyway, thank you for the Valentine this year.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I put all my heartfelt gratitude in this... I'm looking forward to our time together in the future, Master!
