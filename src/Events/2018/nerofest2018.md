# Nerofest 2018   
  
## Commence! The 2nd Nero Fest!  
   
**Nero:**   
What is a festival?  
  
   
**Nero:**   
It is a party that brings joy to all people, regardless of the era or place!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
The same can be said for my festival! It can already be considered a spectacle that both Rome and Chaldea are known for!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
“But that's not the true meaning of a festival,” you say? Umu, I shall leave that distinction to the scholarly Servants.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
The dazzling Nero Fest!  
A joint production between Rome and Chaldea!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Let the festivities begin!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
As it is a martial arts tournament held at the Colosseum, many Servants are going to enjoy this.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Hehehe. I am not familiar with mana and the like, but I can feel it! The joy is in the air!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
A festival of power, modeled after the one once held at Olympia! The people shall praise the courage of warriors!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Highly trained bodies! A competitive display of skill!  
What could be more beautiful, more noble!?  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Like admiring a blooming rose, mankind loves to look upon their wonderous possibilities.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
That's what this Olympic festival, held in my Rome, is all about!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Rome!  
   
**Nero:**   
Rome! Indeed!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
All hail Her Majesty!  
   
**Nero:**   
Hehehe. Your applause is making me blush.  
  
   
  
   
**Nero:**   
Yes, I shall permit it!  
Enjoy this glorious festival!  
  
   
**A：Cú Chulainn:**   
What is it, Master?  
  
   
**A：Cú Chulainn:**   
You're going to participate in this festival thing, right? It's a great way to let off some steam. Let's have fun.  
  
   
**A：Cú Chulainn:**   
Will we end up as friends or foes?  
...Even I don't know.  
  
   
**B：Cú Chulainn:**   
Either way, let's have fun going at it.  
Right, spearless me?  
  
   
**A：Cú Chulainn:**   
Yeah. You know, hearing that from the spear-wielding version of me kind of pisses me off...  
  
   
**C：Cú Chulainn:**   
Hahah. If it bothers you, I can lend you one, elderly me.  
This thing was made real quick. I can replace it.  
  
   
**A：Cú Chulainn:**   
Oh, wasn't this handmade by your last Master or something? I can't take it.  
  
   
**D：Cú Chulainn:**   
(Sigh) This is all so stupid.  
  
   
**D：Cú Chulainn:**   
Are you guys really me?  
Who cares if you have a spear or not?  
  
   
**D：Cú Chulainn:**   
If two people fight, the strong one wins and the weak one dies. There's nothing else to it. So shut up.  
  
   
**All Three:**   
Um... (He's seriously going to try and murder his opponents.)  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Leave it to us. We are on stand-by for medical treatment. Even if someone gets the wrong idea and goes out of control...  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
I shall save all my patients. I will not allow any deaths.  
I shall save them, yes.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
There may be casualties, but no one will die.  
Rest assured.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Wait, wait! You're saying the word “casualties”!  
That includes deaths!  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Yes, I'll be very, very careful about cleanliness in the first aid area. We need to be very cautious about disinfecting and sterilizing.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Don't worry. I'm here. I'll be a little diligent about disinfecting and sterilizing.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Listen to me! Listen to what I'm saying!  
  
   
**Iri:**   
Martha and Nightingale are truly good friends.  
Even their jokes are in perfect harmony.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh, Iri. I'm counting on your healing powers.  
...Wait, I don't think she was joking back there!  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Healing powers?  
Could you possibly be...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Yeah, it's her healing spells.  
It's quite different than my power and your techniques.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...a doctor with surgical experience?  
  
   
**Iri:**   
Huh? A doctor?  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
That's reassuring. Then yes. We can more than double our efficiency when amputating the limbs of the wounded.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Wait, wait, wait, wait!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Normally, when a Servant manifests, it doesn't need food to sustain itself...  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Even so, you get hungry if you move. Even if it's only a feeling, it's important to pay attention.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Feeling good and feeling down are both made up of half-physical, half-mental states.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
With all this moving around at the festival, won't there be an influx of hungry Servants?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Yeah. If that's the case, leave the kitchen and cafeteria to us, Master.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
We'll keep it running 24 hours a day.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Feel free to get hungry anytime!  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
I don't like the idea of helping that woman's festival, but I'll do it for you. Hehe. What a weird feeling.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Master, we have a favor to ask.  
We'd like to have Servants who aren't busy serve tables.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It would help if you could tell them in advance.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
And...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
If you could get rid of that Servant who's been hanging around the cafeteria for a while now...  
  
   
**Altria Alter:**   
...What? Why are you looking at me, Archer?  
  
   
**Altria Alter:**   
I just followed you here in search of snacks.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
“Just”? That's no excuse. Sheesh.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Good timing, Fujimaru!  
How do you turn off the simulator?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Um, actually I...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I got lost. Where am I?  
Why am I walking through the desert again?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
(Sob, sob) I'm beyond lost... I'm not gonna make it in time for the festival at this rate!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Waaahh! I wanna have fun, too! Fun, I say!  
I wanna play, play, and play some more!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Calm down! You're the one who woke me up early this morning, saying you wanted to come!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
You were the one who activated this simulator thing.  
Which means you must have set a turn-off time, right?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
(Sob) A turn-off... time?  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Uh-oh. That's the face and voice she uses when things are bad. Master, turn off the simulator!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
It's a festival, right? Then I want to participate too.  
Is that all right?  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
Your Highness, that's...  
It might not be what you think it is.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
This tournament is a clash of myths, a battle of supernatural blades in the Colosseum.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
Medical Servants may be standing by, but it's still dangerous.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
Your Highness, I suggest you simply dedicate yourself to watching from the sidelines.  
  
   
**Amadeus:**   
Who cares, d'Eon?  
Let her do what she wants.  
  
   
**Amadeus:**   
She'll dance beautifully, no matter where she is.  
I'll write the perfect sonata to go along with it!  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
No, but...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
How wonderful. You're going to write me a sonata?  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
...Then I shall do whatever it takes to assure the queen's safety. I will eliminate all who would hurt her.  
  
   
**Amadeus:**   
I see, I see. That's quite a funny joke.  
Weren't you one of Robespierre's dogs?  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
No, I...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Come on, no fighting. It's a festival.  
We have to have fun. Right?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I met all of you at one time or another during my life...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
We met at different times but now we're here together.  
That's something very special.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
And I think it's wonderful.  
It's like a once-in-a-century festival!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
So you see? It's a waste to argue. Let's have fun, okay?  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
Right, Your Highness.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Then let's say it together!  
Ready, set... Vive la France!  
  
   
**All Three:**   
Vive la France!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oui. Well done!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
So this festival is based on the same event as the modern Olympics.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
None of them actually existed in my era...  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
But even so, I'm honestly looking forward to participating in this.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Let's both do our best, okay?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Fat chance!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Why!? Why should I spend time at a festival with you?  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Don't say that. She's just looking after you.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
It's partially the will of God, but at the same time, she just wants to be like a good parent to you.  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Parent? W-Who are you calling my parent!?  
I-I don't remember you giving birth to me, stupid!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I-I don't remember giving birth to you either!  
But you're still Jeanne d'Arc!  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Which means you were created from the same Spirit Origin that is the basis for my form.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Nnngh, nnngh, don't say it!  
I'll burn you alive! I mean it!  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Hahah. Now, now. Calm down.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Humph.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Flames of vengeance have taken human form as an Avenger, yet she's able to mess around with them. That's impressive, in a way.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Master, did you know?  
That Jeanne d'Arc is not Jeanne d'Arc.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
How could a forgery like her exist? Her hatred and rage have turned her whole body to flame.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
And yet, look at her...  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
...  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
No, I'm sure you understand.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Do as you will. If you truly desire it, even if this is a farce, I shall lend you my power.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
The Count of Monte Cristo will obey you.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
For instance, I would be more than willing to exterminate that squirming Caster over there.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Ooh! Ooh! How could this be!?  
A second Jeanne, born of my desires...  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
...is standing next to the one and only Jeanne, and happily talking to her!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
This was unexpected! Oooh! Oooh!  
How COOL can this get?  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
You there! You, who is concerned about her just as I am.  
Come with me.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
And let us watch over the holy maidens together!  
Come, come!  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Humph. He was being so stupid I decided to take a break.  
  
   
**Edmond Dantès:**   
Heh. Servants who've gone mad can be such a hassle to deal with.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Absolutely not. It's out of the question.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I was indeed a general as well as a Roman soldier.  
But that was a long time ago. Now I'm just a Saber.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Ah, yes! I am a Saber!  
Unfortunately for me, I was summoned as a Servant.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I work in place of my lord. I am truly a slave.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I thought that compared to the Greeks or other civilizations, Rome's slave system was civilized.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Yet it's no different.  
I do not like it one bit.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
You tell me... to fight... Moon Goddess?  
Diana... I...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Nero... Child of my beloved sister...  
At the festival that bears your name, I will...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
RAAARRGGH! FARMING!  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
I WILL FARM MEDALS!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Relax, relax. Sheesh.  
You want Nero's medals more than anybody.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
No, Caesar. Let him.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Gather them as you will, Caligula.  
I see that's the shape of your heart's desire.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
If you think that way, let it be so.  
If wanting something means fighting, then you must fight.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
It is the same with you, Fujimaru. If you need more Ascension materials, then struggle, and fight.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Rome will accept your battle. I'll allow it.  
Desire, seek, love, and fight as you will.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
These are also noble acts, and they are also Rome.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
However, be careful that you do not become a glutton.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
I wouldn't mind going to the kitchen.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Yes. When it comes to handling root vegetables, I am quite skilled within the Round Table. I am second only to Percival.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Just say the word, Master, and I'll be happy to demonstrate my skills.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Calm down, Lord Gawain.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
We will do all we can to serve our Master.  
Even if what we do isn't what we're best at.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
And even if we are split into enemies and allies.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Indeed. That is perhaps the true task of a knight.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
That's right. Forget about the root vegetables.  
Do you understand?  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Master, may I ask you a question?  
Did Mash say anything about me?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I am... No, I must be... the most sinful person here...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
The many sins performed by my other self may not be clearly carved into my Spirit Origin, but even so...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Sins do not disappear.  
Thus, I must still be sinful.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
A fighting tournament...  
I know I shall shed much blood there too.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
This makes me...sad... (Strum)  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
No, it is I who am the greatest sinner.  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
I never wished for it, but as a result of my actions,  
I spread death and sorrow throughout the world.  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
And in the end... I killed her...  
  
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
I killed many in the name of my creed.  
  
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
What did I seek, what did I throw away, and what did I gain? Those days are long gone now, but...  
  
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
...No, this isn't the place to speak of such things.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Hey, hey. We finally made it out of the simulator and somehow walked straight into some kind of confessional tournament.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Looks like they're quite the bunch of sinners.  
Not that I'm one to talk.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I'm beyond words... I'm getting sad too...  
Yep, I have to do something about this.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Good begets good, which creates a cycle of ease.  
Evil begets evil, and creates suffering.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Good actions lead to good rewards.  
Evil actions lead to evil consequences!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
This is indeed the principle of karma!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Confess to me the evil deeds that lie in your past!  
I'll hear you out!  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Oh there you are, Master.  
Is it true that you met Mr. Holmes?  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Actually, when I was alive I also...  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Wait. I'd like to talk more, but they're calling me from the infirmary.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
You might be surprised, but I know a thing or two about medicine and pharmaceuticals. I hope I'll be able to help you and your Servants.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
See you later!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yo, you came to the festival too, Master? Hey, was there some scrawny weakling walking around here?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Well, whatever. Fran, let's go.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, Fran?  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uuh.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Are you done charging?  
Don't run out of juice on me, alright?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
We need to show people who the strongest electric-type Servant is. A festival is as good a chance as any.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I was faster last time, but...  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuuh.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...Nothing happened, you know?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Oro? I got fried to a crisp, you say?  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I don't know what you're talking about.  
Anyway, Master! It's a Servant tournament!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Whoever wins will have all the heroines fall in love with them! This is the perfect chance to build a harem!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Come with me and we'll win the tournament, and maybe “accidentally” run into some female Servants in the shower room!  
  
   
**Anne:**   
He's as energized as always, but he's definitely fried to a crisp.  
  
   
**Mary:**   
...He was annoying some little girl a minute ago.  
One with a horn. She had bangs covering her eyes too.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
What are you talking about? I have absolutely no idea!  
  
   
**Edison:**   
How sad! What a sad case of electrocution!  
This is where I, DC Detective Edison, come in!  
  
   
**Edison:**   
I sense a whiff of evil AC about this case!  
I must solve it quickly!  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Hah! I'm laughing so hard my muscly sides are about to split! AC is the true light that illuminates the darkness.  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
So I'll be the one who uncovers the truth!  
Me, AC Detective Nikola Tesla!  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I shall hunt down the foolish lightning that burnt the pirate to a crisp! Don't worry! Electricity knows all!  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Don't move, Edison! You're a suspect in this electrocution case, and I'm going to interrogate you.  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I shall find the proof as fast as lightning!  
  
   
**Edison:**   
Get out of here with that “as fast as lightning” nonsense! You trying to be clever!? ...Hang on, that was actually pretty good! Ugh!  
  
   
**Edison:**   
But I will be the one to solve the case with lightning-quick speed! On your knees, Tesla!  
My inventions have more patents than yours!  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
...!  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Are you still talking about sheer numbers?  
...Unfortunate, but not at all surprising, Mr. Lion-Head.  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
It seems you're unaware that more accurate reviews have been going around in recent times.  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Hahaha! Everyone's starting to learn that I, Nikola Tesla, am the true genius that surpassed Edison!  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
In recent years, I've been in more movies than you have!  
  
   
**Edison:**   
Shocking! Don't tell me that in fiction you've been making electro-transportation and replication machines!  
  
   
**Edison:**   
I'm so jealous!  
  
   
**Edison:**   
Excuse me. There was an AC bug there.  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
My apologies. There was a DC cat there.  
  
   
**Edison:**   
...  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
...  
  
   
**Edison:**   
All right. War then?  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Of course. It's war.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Stop! What are you men doing?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
You're both too old for this! Grow up!  
  
   
**Gentleman & Lion:**   
Gwah! You're...!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
First you fight at the barbecue, and now here!  
Do you geniuses ever learn?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
No matter how old you are, you're still childish.  
...Not like that bothers me, but still...  
  
   
**Edison:**   
R-Right.  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
...Right.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
What is the big idea, going on a rampage in front of all these people?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
I remember telling you that you should go to the festival if you had the energy to fight.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...Wait, is this my fault?  
  
   
**Edison:**   
N-No, it's not! Not at all!  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Indeed! We just lit a fuse, that's all!  
  
   
**Edison:**   
That's right... This is Chaldea, not the Colosseum.  
  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
We used the electrocution case as an excuse to do what we wanted. And we caused problems for Chaldea's staff as well.  
  
   
**Gentleman & Lion:**   
We're deeply sorry...  
  
   
**Helena:**   
As long as you understand.  
And make sure you apologize to everyone too.  
  
   
**Gentleman & Lion:**   
Yes, ma'am...  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
I want to...go. I'm...strong. Even I know.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Hmm, you do? But we're already on a nice, cool, peaceful island.  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
There's no need to fight here.  
Or are you bored?  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
A “simulator,” was it? This illusionary island made by Roman and Da Vinci.  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
No... Not at all. It's fun...here...  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
But...I want to...test...my strength!  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Aww, once you decide something, you never change your mind. Well, boys will be boys...  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Fine. Go on ahead and join the festival.  
But...  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Listen. You're strong, but don't push yourself too hard, okay?  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Okay. Thank you...Euryale.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
...Hmmm.  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
What do you call something like that?  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
Oh Euryale, do you realize what you are making my face look like right now?  
  
   
**Medusa:**   
(You're looking wonderful too, Sister!)  
  
   
**Stheno:**   
...Come here for a second, will you, Medusa?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Why, if it isn't Master.  
Leave.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
All this stuff about the festival of Olympia, the Colosseum... It's completely geared towards muscleheads.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
There's nothing for us to do. Fight Assassins?  
I don't care. Use a Berserker or something!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
It's an awful shame, Master, but this time I hereby gratefully refuse.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
If there was something interesting that could inspire me, things might be different...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
But this time, it's only muscle! Muscle! Muscle! It's a celebration of muscle in this resurgent Olympic festival.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I believe we should stay indoors and focus on our writing. I hope you understand.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I'm here too. Let me join in, scribblers!  
I came! I saw! I slept!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
He looks so relaxed while the sofa creaks under his weight. What a splendid picture of degeneration!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
He's just like a writer before a deadline!  
Oh, indeed he is.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
He's a legitimate writer. He is the author of Commentaries on the Gallic Wars, after all.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Oh. A war chronicle. Excellent.  
How about we have a different author for each country?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
A shared world series? Interesting. While they're having their festival out there, let's have some fun ourselves.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
All right, time to get started&mdash;  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Zzzzzz...!!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
He's asleep already!?  
And snoring away majestically, no less!  
  
   
**Karna:**   
I heard Emperor Nero's declaration.  
Though I am not quite sure I understood it entirely.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Master, I want to make a vow to you here.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Without obsessing over victory or defeat, I will show you a fight worthy of being in this tournament.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...I did not expect to receive a chance such as this. I am grateful to you, and I am grateful for this good fortune.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
If you say that you will give your all to this festival and its battles, I will fight as well.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
As your enemy, I had the opportunity to slay you three times...  
  
   
**Karna:**   
I don't know the details myself, but the battles for the festival supposedly use the simulator.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
What? Is that so?  
  
   
**Karna:**   
You can test your strength this way without taking anyone's life. Modern technology never ceases to amaze me.  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Thinking back, it was the same with Jinako's game. It uses the movements of electrons to create a pseudo-intelligence...  
  
   
**Karna:**   
...that made noises and moved images. Even the legendary scenes in our memories could appear as virtual reality.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
A game...?  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
No. No, that's somehow different.  
Don't change the subject, Karna!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
How trivial.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Such a trivial...trifling matter.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Indeed. This is nonsense.  
It's worthless to even speak of the reasons.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Seems like we're on the same page, Sun King.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Of course, Golden King.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Right, right. That's exactly right. Why bother imitating an ancient Roman festival? It's laughable!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
The great pharaoh has appeared. Thus, when it comes to reviving old things, it should be left to us!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Or perhaps... yes, if there was an older, nobler king...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
No, even then that's questionable. When it comes to ancient kings, nothing compares to a pharaoh, no?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
It's very simple. It's obvious who the strongest is here.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
You're exactly right.  
Indeed, it's clear which Heroic Spirit is the strongest.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Just like how the sun shines brightly in the sky, the fact speaks for itself. It's foolish to even question it.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Heh. Your words are too grand.  
You're embarrassing me.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Oh please. I'm the one who's feeling embarrassed.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
(Feeling very nervous)  
  
   
**Medb:**   
“Nero Fest”? Hah!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
I didn't get a single scene during the summer swimsuit event! Cú was there, but I wasn't!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
I had a part in the... what was it? Magical Girl event? But I don't remember it, and supposedly Cú was even more tiny!  
  
   
**Medb:**   
And now I learn I'm making an appearance, but there's no Cú! What is going on?  
  
   
**Medb:**   
It's all men I'm not interested in! And it pisses me off even more because everyone else looks so happy! I'm gonna cry!  
  
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
You can't let yourself get so depressed.  
Good luck and good fortune are drawn to smiles.  
  
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
And it's not all bad. You met me.  
  
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
Not to brag, but I'm strong. If you join with me, winning the tournament won't be a drea&mdash;  
  
   
**Medb:**   
(Sigh) I wonder if there are any beefy warriors around...  
At this point, even Master would do...  
  
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
Hmm, she doesn't even see me!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Ooh, she's fuming. She's mad! Oh my.  An angry Queen Medb is great too.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Don't talk like you know.  
You're only looking at her body anyway.  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
No, no. That's not true. I mean, it's partially true.  
But I can love more than a girl's body, you know.  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
It's one thing to see her as a scheming and dominating queen, but it's nice to see she can be just a girl sometimes.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Humph. Is that so?  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Of course. Sometimes she's scary, but other times she can be a dame.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I see. Your easygoing nature can occasionally be a shortcoming.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Anyway, setting aside her usual debauchery, I'm quite excited about this festival.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
There are so many heroes here. I assume there are some who surpass me. Heheh. Heheheheh...  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
(Gulp)  
(She is ready to kick some butt...)  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Ooh! So that's the Colosseum?  
It's pretty golden and gorgeous!  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
I see. So it is. It's finally time to show the true power of the Minamoto clan.  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Are you ready, Kintoki? Remember the perilous time when you pursued the Earth Spider into the dark otherworld...  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
...or when you battled that giant one as big as a divine insect.  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
There is no need to hold back.  
Show me and Master your power!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Haha! What are you talking about, Boss Raikou?  
That's just the spirit heading into war!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
It's just a festival, so there's no need to go all out...  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
No. That won't do. That won't do at all, Kintoki.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
You speak the truth, my ancestor!  
I shall take the heads of all our enemies!  
  
   
**Benkei:**   
If Lord Ushiwaka says so, I shall do the same!  
I'll rip the head off one enemy after another!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Guys, that ain't what we're here for!  
No murders and no decapitations!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
No killing! No death! Yes, Olympia!  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
No, that won't do at all! If we're going to do this, we must be thorough! Otherwise we'll lose, Kintoki!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
We do not! Why are you so riled up, Raikou?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
...Hehe. Looks like everyone's here.  
Goodness me, too much time on their hands...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Perhaps the lineup is better than expected...  
Yes, very well. Let's play with them.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Leave it to me, Shuten! No matter how many of these human heroes there are, it makes no difference!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Or rather, the more there are, the more my flames will burn in excitement. The festival of Olympia will be child's play.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I'm told they use a flame in that festival.  
If they do, then I shall add it to my Sougenbi!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
The Olympic flame, was it?  
I don't think they've got any of that here.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Oh, and Ibaraki. If you want to come up with evil plans,  
I don't think it's a good idea to say them in front of Master.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Hmm. I see. I'm not sure what to do then.  
Hmm...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I'll call off my evil plan!  
But for now, I'm staying with you, Shuten!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Do what you want. More importantly, are we...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Are we on your side, Master?  
Or are we enemies?  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
...If we're enemies, my bad! Heheh.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Everyone's really excited in their own way!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is going to be a fun festival, Senpai.  
I can't wait!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go get a bunch of medals!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's make it a fun festival.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai! We'll have lots of fun!
