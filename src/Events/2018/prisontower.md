# Vengeful Demon's Wail at the Prison Tower  
  
## 1st Door: The Dark Haired Demon  
   
**B：???:**  
&mdash;Have you ever envied someone?  
  
   
**B：???:**  
Have you ever faced someone with the talent, opportunity, and riches that you lacked, and knelt down before them in defeat?  
  
   
**B：???:**  
This world is rife with inequality, and so we shed our tears as we ruminate on the sanctity of fairness. Have you experienced that?  
  
   
**B：???:**  
Do not answer. There is no need for you to.  
  
   
**B：???:**  
Peer inside your heart. Do not turn your eyes from what you see. For that is what every heart holds. None can escape it.  
  
   
**B：???:**  
It is what leads us to covet and begrudge one another, then shed tears of regret.  
  
   
**B：???:**  
The sin of envy.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, is something the matter?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why do you ask?  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, it's just... You suddenly stopped walking and broke off in mid-speech.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You just kept standing there in silence, so I thought maybe something was worrying you...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Good morning, Mash.  
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning.  
I mean&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, were you doing your special move, the REM REM Trance? As in, sleeping while standing?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I was wondering if that was the case since you suddenly stopped walking and broke off mid-speech...  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Your expression sort of looked vacant too.  
Are you not feeling well?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I haven't noticed anything.  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, okay... Just in case, let's go get you a medical check-up.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Just daydreaming?  
   
**Mash:**   
It's possible. Let's get you checked out in case it was caused by magecraft.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
First, let's get you to your room, Senpai.  
I'll call the Doctor over&mdash;  
  
   
**B：???:**  
Welcome to the Prison Tower on the Isle of Despair, Senpai!  
  
   
**B：???:**  
Sinner by the name of Fujimaru! This is a place beyond love and hate, thus any soul may be imprisoned here!  
  
   
**B：???:**  
You are no exception.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I'm in Chaldea.  
   
**B：???:**  
Chaldea? No. You are certainly not.  
Ha, ha, ha, your beloved little friend is not here.  
  
   
**B：???:**  
And neither is that meddlesome Doctor, nor that pervert who is so pleased with his own body's modification. You are the only one here.  
  
   
**B：???:**  
...Though, of course, I am here too.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Who are you?  
   
**B：???:**  
A Heroic Spirit who does not belong in this world.  
To borrow a phrase from your adorable friend.  
  
   
**B：???:**  
A name comes to mind, does it not?  
Or have you already forgotten?  
  
   
**B：???:**  
That is fine. Forget it all. Only a vengeful soul would seek to carve all things indelible upon itself.  
  
   
  
   
**B：???:**  
Oh, that's right&mdash; Did you find that First Tower fun? No, it's all right. Don't speak. I don't actually wish to hear your opinions.  
  
   
**B：???:**  
It was but an automatic reflex of hospitality. Like an involuntary reply to someone calling out your name.  
  
   
**B：???:**  
The Second Tower welcomes you.  
Do enjoy it to its fullest extent.  
  
   
**Unknown Spirit:**   
Uu...uuuuuuuuu...  
Uuuuuu...  
  
   
**B：???:**  
See, they are all coming out to greet you. It seems they don't find the warm pulse of your soul likable.  
  
   
**B：???:**  
It may not be like the First Tower, but a large number of dead souls have congregated here as well.  
  
   
**B：???:**  
They seem severely agitated, don't they?  
They're resentful. And envious.  
  
   
**B：???:**  
Of you! You, who stands in this room and yet still lives!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They're going to attack me?!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...That's totally unreasonable!  
   
  
   
**B：???:**  
Haha, calm yourself, Master.  
There are so many things you still need to know.  
  
   
**B：???:**  
For instance, where, exactly, are you right now?  
And who am I?  
  
   
**B：???:**  
That said, most of the information that awaits you will be quite trivial, but...you can at least learn one thing of importance.  
  
   
**B：???:**  
For instance... Yes, the ugliness of you humans&mdash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
With just one blow...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Just exactly who are you!? Where am I!?  
   
  
   
**B：???:**  
This is Hell. Namely, the Château d'If, the prison tower that lies beyond love and hate.  
  
   
**B：???:**  
And I...  
  
   
**B：???:**  
...am a Heroic Spirit. A part of a tale that you should know quite well. I am one piece of the curse that has laid its shadow upon this world.  
  
   
**B：???:**  
I, born of sadness and given form through my unending resentment, rage, and hatred as an Extra Class...  
  
   
**B：???:**  
Yes&mdash; You can refer to me as Avenger.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
For so long as I live&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Survive this, and you shall learn a great deal of things, though they may be twisted. This is a place for that.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
However, I am under no obligation to spend time teaching you how to obtain them.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I have no intention of becoming your very own Abbé Faria. I shall have your soul battered and tossed about until I am sated.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Abbé Faria?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hmmph.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...First of all, I've never even heard of an Avenger class.  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Haha! I told you it was an Extra Class, didn't I?  
Of course you've never heard of it.  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
However, I shall teach you the absolute minimum of things you need to know, briefly that is.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
First, your soul has been imprisoned.  
To escape, you must pass the seven Halls of Judgment.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Your voice shall not reach Chaldea, nor shall its voice reach you.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
If you're defeated and killed in the Halls of Judgment, you die. If you do nothing and seven days have passed, you also die.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
That is all.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why are you doing this?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What about Mash? And Chaldea?  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Ha, ha! Who can say?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
This Château d'If is very different than the one that existed in history.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
It bears some similarity to the Singularities you have seen, but again, it's something else.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
This is a hunting ground.  
A type created by the King of Mages.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hunting ground for what?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The Grand Caster?!  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Who can say?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Now then, the first Hall of Judgment awaits. The first stage to mount in order to survive the Seven Nights.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Seven Lords are waiting for you.  
Every single one of them is itching to kill you.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Behold this! Savor this!  
First up is the Phantom of the Opera!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Seeking a beautiful voice and detesting all things ugly,  
he is a monster of Envy who has come to kill you!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Christine...  
Christine, Christine, Christine!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
I shall sing to you in your sleep...with all the love in my heart.  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Ahh, but tonight, a new star stands upon the stage!  
Ahh, who are you? You are not Christine!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Here, my soul and my voice are bound up as one!  
Which is to say...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He's attacking me now?!  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Of course he is!  
I already told you he was a monster that would kill you!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Could it be due to a Mental Corruption skill?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
No, not at all! Hahaha! Try listening for a change!  
He has dominion over this room, and is here to kill you!  
  
   
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Look not upon my face! Look not! Look not!  
You are not Christine, so I cannot bear it!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Whoever you may be,  
I... I...cannot let you live.  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Oh, Christine! My love!  
Oh, Christine! My masterpiece!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Let me dig my nails into a voice the equal of yours! Let me rip apart a throat the equal of yours and see it gush red!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
How I want... And want... And want... I am inconsolable tonight.  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
...Oh, how I envy all people, near and far!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Take a good look, Master. This is man. This is a caricature of the human beings your world is overrun with!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Fight. Kill. You don't have time to hesitate. Because&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
It makes no difference whether you believe me or not. There'll be no reasoning with him. He will kill you!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hahaha! Look! Just look! He can barely contain how badly he wants to add your throat to his collection!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Sing! Sing, my angel! Tonight, there's no song better than your dying scream!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
What will you do? Only defend yourself?  
Or will you fight?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I'll defend myself.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...I'll fight.  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Then take my hand! We will show this black-haired masked demon a true dance of death!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Avenger:**   
How fragile! How fragile! You poor thing, all you can become is naught but an ugly monster!  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Château d'If is not the place for your soul!  
You are far too pitiful to be a murderer!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
From the end of time... I see a light...  
Does it open...an emotionless hole in my heart?  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Oh, my heart... Where are you?  
Oh, my love... Where are you?  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Christine... I offer my heart to you...  
Christine... I offer my love...to you...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're singing of love, huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What a sad song...  
   
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Are you certain? Listen carefully.  
That is the other song that black-haired murderer sings.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
My vengeful strike has shattered his Spirit Core and he has little time left, but his song will last till the very end.  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Christine... My love... I love you, but... Christine... I simply cannot endure...  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Noble Christine... The people who live with you... Beloved Christine... Everything in your world...  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
The people who spend time with you... The world where the morning sun rises... I... I...  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
&mdash;Sometimes... I envy them... And it drives me mad&mdash;  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Hahaha! Hahahahahaha!  
Hahahahahahaha!  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Phantom of the Opera, I have witnessed your envy.  
I have killed you, and I shall carry your ugliness in my heart and move onward!  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Be proud in hell.  
For you are a true human.  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
...Please, be careful.  
Fujimaru, my Christine.  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
There is only one who will protect you in this twisted Château d'If.  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
And that one may not necessarily be good.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What do you mean?  
   
**Phantom:**   
I'm sorry, Christine, my love.  
I can say no more.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Weren't you just killed?  
   
**Phantom:**   
I was indeed slain in the Hall of Judgment.  
But what died was my ultimate ugliness.  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
However, we never...  
  
   
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Hahahahahah! So this is what it's like to fight with a Master!  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
I commend you on the brilliant moves you made.  
It may be a temporary contract, but you are a true Master!  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
You mastered the use of a Heroic Spirit you'd only just met! Me! An Extra Class, an Avenger, no less!  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Now, on to the second Hall of Judgment!  
Six more Lords await!  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Roar like a tiger.  
For you are allowed to do everything.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Hold it.  
   
**Avenger:**   
...Hmm?  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Oh? Are you scared to go with me?  
Are you uncertain you're walking the right path?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can I really get out of here?  
   
**Avenger:**   
...Heh.  
  
   
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Very well. I have but one thing to say in answer to your doubts.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
“Attendre et espérer.” Wait and hope.  
  
   
## 2nd Door: The Devil of Purgatory  
   
**Mash:**   
The Château d'If?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It was a prison tower that existed in France, in the Bay of Marseille. It was a fortress built in the 16th century.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It was primarily used to hold political and ideological offenders.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But the prison was closed at the end of the 19th century, and now it's just a historical site.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It became world-famous after Dumas wrote his novel&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;Can you hear me, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I was just in Chaldea now.  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I guess you should properly recognize the reality.  
  
   
Haha. Listen. You're still in Chaldea right now.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Of course you are, your body is still there.  
Have you not noticed?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Huh? Where's Mash?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Your pretty little friend is still in Chaldea.  
And so is your body.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hah. I love the shocked look on your face!  
That's right, your body is still in Chaldea!  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
What is trapped here is your soul.  
I said that before, didn't I?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I know it's hard to wrap your head around the concept. The flow of time and the concept of space are different between here and there.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
These seven days may only be a single day in Chaldea.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'd hate if it was the other way around.  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Humph. It makes no real difference.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Could it be seven years in Chaldea?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
It's very possible.  
Hah, your expression just changed, Master.  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
If you want to stop the separation of your soul and body, it's simple. You must pass through the remaining six Halls of Judgment.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But we're back in that cell.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Do I have to start over?  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
The concept of space is different here.  
Oh, I said this already.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
We always start here, but our destination will be different.  
  
   
Let's go. The second judgment awaits you.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...Oh, that reminds me.  
Feel free to lay on that bed there if you want.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Wait for a hand to reach out from somewhere to save you, and long for a miracle.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
That's the simplest solution.  
The rest will be taken care of automatically.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...What happens if I do that?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Your soul rots, and you'll never wake up in Chaldea again. That's all.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...No, I'll pass.  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...Humph. Then let's go.  
  
   
**C：Woman's Voice:**   
...Someone...  
  
   
**C：Woman's Voice:**   
Someone...  
Oh...Is there no one there?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Mmm&mdash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I heard a woman's voice!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I heard something!  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
What's that look?  
You seem as if you want to help her.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Is that your sense of justice?  
  
   
Hahaha. You don't seem very concerned for yourself!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Or do you just not understand the situation? Very well. Go help the voice, but...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Stay on your guard.  
Or you'll die.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;There they are. Is that it?  
  
   
**C：Woman:**   
...Help me...  
  
   
**C：Woman:**   
I woke up here...  
...alone in the darkness...  
  
   
**C：Woman:**   
Where...am I?  
It's so dark... I'm so scared...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you okay?  
   
**C：Woman:**   
Thank you.  
I just found myself here...  
  
   
**C：Woman:**   
This place is so dark, and so sad...  
I don't know why it feels this way...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you the second Lord?  
   
**C：Woman:**   
What? I don't understand. I just found myself here...  
  
   
**C：Woman:**   
It's so dark and cold...  
Like a scream was frozen and hanged in the air...  
  
   
**C：Woman:**   
Am I...dead?  
Have I gone to hell?  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Woman. Do you have a name?  
  
   
**C：Woman:**   
I... I...  
No, I don't know. I'm sorry.  
  
   
**C：Woman:**   
I don't know why I'm here, or where I am.  
And oh...my name!  
  
   
**C：Woman:**   
I can't remember my name.  
Um... I was looking for something important...  
  
   
**C：Woman:**   
...I think I was...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hmmph. A woman whose name and memories were stolen? Interesting. Call yourself Mercédès, then.  
  
   
**C：Woman:**   
...Mercédès...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
It was the name of a woman dear to a man who was robbed of his name, and everything he had, at the Château d'If.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's a good name.  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A man who was robbed of everything?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hmmph. You'll learn someday.  
That is, if you pass through all the Halls of Judgment.  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Now, Master. Fool, who would save this tainted world. What will you do with Mercédès?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I will leave it to your judgment.  
Leave her here, or put her in a cell.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
I-I don't want to be alone...  
It feels like something bad is staring at me...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Shut up.  
The choice isn't yours to make.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'd feel bad leaving her here.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...I'll take her with me.  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Fine.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
No matter who this woman is,  
it doesn't change what you must do.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
You... You would save me, even though you don't know who I am?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
...Thank you.  
May the blessings of God be upon you.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hmmph.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wait, and hope.  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Heh. Indeed. Indeed! No matter what happens, that is the only thing allowed by you humans!  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;Have you ever felt lust?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
That is my question for you in the second Hall of Judgment, Master.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Have you ever longed to touch the body of another human being, with a properly developed personality?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Have you ever driven reason and wisdom from your mind and given in to mad, bestial urges?  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Of course I have!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Great Spin of Heaven and Earth! That's the way of the world! Of course, I do it all the time!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
How can you be a warrior or a hero without bestial lust? If you say what I do is a sin, very well! Hahaha!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Then I stand here as the greatest of sinners! I am the leader of the Red Branch Knights, and former King of Ulster!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
AND I MOSTLY LOVE WOMEN!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He's spun so much he doesn't care anymore!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mostly?  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Look into his heart. Do not avert your eyes.  
It is something all humans have, and none can escape it.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
That which seeks others, which shakes, which leads to sordid tears.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
The sin of lust&mdash;  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Who are you calling sordid!? I eat when I want to eat, and bed someone when I want to bed them!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
That is the true way of mankind!  
That is the greatest pleasure in life!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Hahahaha! And of course, now is one of those times!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
You there, woman! I can tell! You're one who's worthy of respect, and difficult to bed!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
I find you quite attractive!  
Especially those protruding breasts!  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
M-Me?  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
I was scared I'd have to drink and sleep alone here in this moldy prison, but my night's looking up already!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
YOU WILL BE MINE!  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
And you, Fujimaru, and the new Servant!  
  
   
You're, you know. Whatever. I don't need you.  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
You're in the way. I'll kill you.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Huh?  
   
**Fergus:**   
I said I'll kill you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're kidding, right Fergus?  
   
**Fergus:**   
No, I'm not. I'm a Celt.  
I've decided I'm going to kill you for real.  
  
   
  
   
**Fergus:**   
This is a self-evident principle. The law of survival.  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
You're trying to kidnap my woman, aren't you? I can tell. Yes, I can tell. You're trying...  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
...TO STEAL MY WOMAN! AND! IT! AIN'T! HAPPENING!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
My sword lies in both heaven and earth, and my power spins in the heavens! Great Spin of Heaven and Earth!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He's gone crazy!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Mutation!  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Oh, I see.  
You're unaware of the Vision of Tnugdalus.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
What did you think that was?  
It's not Fergus, warrior of the Ulsters.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
It was what was seen by the medieval knight Tnugdalus, who fell into another world and came to know fear.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
In the fourth torture chamber of purgatory, created by the glory of the Almighty, lies a guard lifting up the jaw of a beast like a burning hill&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
It is the Devil of Purgatory!  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
The legend of Purgatory from medieval Europe, and the suffering of the soul... For some reason, I know them...  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Once the Almighty captured those pious heroes who offered their worship to a foreign god!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Of course, that's likely an interpretation brought by the passage of time, but this is the Château d'If! The prison of despair!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
If it's a place that has once proven that God shall not save everyone...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...Then it's only natural the unworthy would gather here!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
GIVE ME THAT WOMAN!  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Aah!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Now what will you do, Master?  
Give this woman you don't know to the lusty hero?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Or, despite not even knowing her name&mdash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Avenger! Lend me your strength!  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Very well! Let us see if the vengeful tiger's fangs can defeat the bestial demon of Purgatory!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Senpai? Senpai?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, are you sure you're not sick?  
You don't look good.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, do you understand me?  
Do you remember what we were talking about?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Château d'If.  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm glad. Your consciousness is intact.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What was it again?  
   
**Mash:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I knew it. Your mind isn't fully here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Your eyes go out of focus as we talk and you keep mumbling&mdash;  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'll call the Doctor. He didn't see anything in that brief physical yesterday...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...but I think you need a full medical checkup.  
It must be all those Rayshifts...  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Hey, excuse me, Master.  
Oh, you're here too, Miss Mash&mdash;Wait, what's going on here?  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
You don't look good. You're pale.  
Actually, you're as white as a ghost!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fergus, good timing!  
Can you help me with Senpai?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's probably better to take Senpai directly to the medical room than wait for the Doctor...  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Of course. I had a feeling something might be bad.  
Looks like I was right.  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
But I don't think that medical-whatsits are gonna help much. No point in worrying about it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No point?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;Well done. You have cleared the second Hall of Judgment.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
The Devil of Purgatory was defeated, and met his end. Now we proceed to the third hall.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
U-Um...  
What am I supposed to do now?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go together.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I won't leave you here.  
   
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Thank you... I don't even remember my name, but I'll do my best to be helpful.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Do you have the strength to spare for a woman like this?  
  
   
Haha. I'll admit that you have a generous spirit.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
That's right. It's too early for despair.  
You should just keep walking forward.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
If you despair and think you cannot fight anymore, tell me. I'll kill you, without waiting for the seven days to pass.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
But if you wish to continue&mdash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
“Wait, and hope,” right?  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;Hahaha! That's right, my temporary Master!  
  
   
## 3rd Door: Monster of R'lyeh  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All vitals look fine. I'm not seeing any issues with the magical circuit either.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But this certainly isn't normal.  
Fujimaru, can you hear me?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...No response.  
The eyes seem to be looking at us...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...but the mind isn't here, and we're not getting any response from our answers. Even if the eyes are open, that's all that is.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I've been with you all the time these past three days... I should've realized something was wrong from the start.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I do see occasional magical circuit activity.  
That might be our hint.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Da Vinci and I will keep doing a detailed diagnosis and analysis.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fergus seemed to know something, right?  
  
   
But he wouldn't answer my questions.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Me neither. He said there was nothing we could do from here...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai&mdash;  
Wake up, Senpai!  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
How are you feeling?  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Oh, please keep lying down.  
There's no need to force yourself out of bed.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
You seemed to be having a bad dream so I spoke to you. I apologize for scaring you.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I was dreaming.  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
About your memories?  
You haven't lost yours like I lost mine.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
The reason you can be so courageous...  
Is probably because of your memories.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
I... I could never be like you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think I saw Chaldea...  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
That's where you belong, isn't it?  
Chaldea...  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
I've never heard that name.  
But it's important to you, isn't it?  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
When you say the name, I can see the nobility in your eyes.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
I'm so...jealous.  
I'm sure you know what you must do in life.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
But I... I don't even know who I am.  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
How does it feel to have a woman care for you?  
It's not a bad thing, is it?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You're probably the first to turn a woman into a maid at the Château d'If, Master.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You do like to sleep, though.  
You were out for an entire day.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good morning.  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
There is no morning or night here. It is completely isolated from the outside world, so it's meaningless.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hello, my temporary Master.  
I have a question for your addled head.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wait. Was I out that long?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
The soul seeks rest of its own volition.  
You may not always be this way, but today you are.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
How does it feel to wake up, my temporary Master?  
I have a question for your addled head.  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;Have you ever been slothful?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Have you ever known what you must do, but instead of exerting effort, given in to the temptation of rest?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Have you ever acted, not as a gear in the machine of society, but as one who seeks only their own pleasure?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Oh, there is no need to answer.  
That's what you're doing right now.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
...That's going too far, Avenger.  
Fujimaru is too exhausted to get up...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Oh I'm sure. The connection between soul and body is becoming unstable.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You're spending less and less time with your mind in Chaldea, correct?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Do as you please. You can sleep here, or you can stand and face the third judgment.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Whatever it is, you must choose.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I'll get up.  
   
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Fujimaru!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Haha, yes. That's perfect! As long as your soul continues, I shall witness its end!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I am not going to slow my pace down. If you don't wish to be left behind, try your best to keep up.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Focus on the existence of your magic circuits. You are human. You can only gain power through reason.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Weave the magical energy from your body at Chaldea like you've done so far, to fuel your spells.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Fight. Kill.  
Just as you've done on your way here.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Silence.)  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...Haha. Did that anger you? Forgive me.  
These words and actions are the way of an Avenger!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
We gather malicious intent just by existing.  
You cannot escape hating us.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You hate. Kill. Grind down. And then forget. Even though it is precisely that infinite cruelty which creates avengers of darkness.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Was it okay to leave Mercédès?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Let her wait in the cell.  
The Hall of Judgment that awaits is yours alone.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
To be precise, yes, this is your Château d'If.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Your trapped soul forces fragments of the souls you've formed relationships with to come here, across time and space.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Yes. You've forged a relationship with that woman.  
Or perhaps you will in the future.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Don't think too much about it.  
Just keep killing the enemies you see.  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...I would hope you'd understand by now...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...but the third judgment will pit you against the avatar of Sloth.  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
&mdash;Oh Lord!  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
Was it you who has brought me to this stage? Very well then! I shall perform, be it tragedy or comedy!  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
But be warned. All of my performances shall be blasphemous!  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
Shining one, tremble before my blasphemy!  
Holy one, let my mockery bring you to down to earth!  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
Oh! Ooh! Blessings be upon this place!  
My heart is pounding like never before!  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
I shall offer up to God the ultimate COOL!  
Yes, perhaps the soul of a hope-filled hero!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How is that sloth?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He looks ready to go to me!  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hahahaha! What?  
That is the greatest sloth imaginable!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
He has forgotten his purity as a knight, and even what it was his Saint stood for!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
He let his soul rot, and fall!  
His is the lowest state of humanity!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
He is a manifestation of the worst that humanity can become!  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
Your words honor me!  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
Yes! Yes! And so my comedy shall make a mockery of the Lord!  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
You, dark laughing man who doubts in the Lord, to hell you shall go! Along with that holy light!  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
A soul filled with hope, refusing to give up hope that they will someday return, even in an eternal prison! How wonderful!  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
No, no. It's never going to happen.  
No matter how much hope you have, you will end here.  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
Did you know?  
The soul can feel pain.  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
If I break the fingers of your soul, sever its limbs, slice open its belly, stir its intestines and rip out its eyes&mdash;  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
You will fall into despair immediately!  
Faster than a shooting star in the night sky!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll pass.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's crazy!  
   
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
Noble soul who would save the world!  
I shall send you to the pits of hell!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Kill! Kill! Kill!  
He knows how to devour your soul!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
...Hmm. That's not good, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
You're not responding to even Lady Mash or the Doctor's calls? Your soul must have wondered off to some abyss indeed.  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
I'm sorry. It seems a fragment of me has caused you problems...  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
What a strange state you are in.  
I cannot save you.  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
But don't worry. As far as I know, the light of your soul is without peer.  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
You will someday return here, as long as that light does not go out.  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
...Of course, at my level, I have no way of knowing everything on your mind.  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
But even so...  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
May the blessing of my Holy Maiden be with you.  
  
   
## 4th Door: God Doesn't Speak  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
&mdash;Oh, good. You're awake.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
You can hear me, right Fujimaru? I can tell.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
There's something I want to tell you.  
It's a record from a long time ago, a tale of vengeance...  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
A story of emotions that never faded, even if everyone forgot about them.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
It is the story of a man.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
...Good morning, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
I'm sorry I'm whispering.  
  
   
You see, this morning... I'm not sure if it's morning, though...  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Avenger seems rather angry about something.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
So... You should probably try to not aggravate him.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He's always angry.  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Is he? He doesn't seem that way to me.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Usually he looks like he's having fun.  
But today...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is he that mad?  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
He usually seems to be having fun.  
  
   
...Huh? Is that wrong?  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
It's not obvious, but he does seem to be enjoying himself...  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
But things are different today.  
He seems very upset...  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...You're awake.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
We're going to the fourth Judgment. Don't fall behind.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...You're right.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's gloomier than usual?  
   
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Yes, that's right.  
Oh, and please take care today.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
I'll be praying that you come back safe, and don't get hurt.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...I'll say this before we start.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
What you will kill this time, in the fourth Hall of Judgment, is the avatar of Wrath.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Wrath. Anger. Fury.  
I define these as the strongest feelings.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
It can be a private rage that exists only within oneself, or an open rage against the entire world.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Righteous rage draws people more than anything. Sometimes they even praise the tragedies it brings.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
A splendid vengeance, they call it.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
It doesn't matter who you are, or where you are.  
All humans love stories of revenge.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
And!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
That bastard refuses to admit this! She denies anger, the most pure emotion!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Even placed in the role of the fourth lord, she still speaks of salvation and forgiveness!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Unforgivable. Unforgivable!  
False salvation makes me want to vomit.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do you like wrath that much?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Don't ask something so stupid. Let's go.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
“That bastard”?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Indeed! That bastard! People may forgive, and God may forgive, but I will not!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You! You will fight her in the next Hall of Judgment!  
You can use me in the next battle all you want.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I shall gladly aide you!  
It will be an honor to rip her apart!  
  
   
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
...You're here, then. Enemy of the righteous, who would lead the lost soul to further abyss.  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
The other me was inflicted with madness, but I am Gilles de Rais, the knight who stands with the holy banner!  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
My blade of righteousness shall condemn you!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Saber Gilles de Rais!?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
He's slightly different than the last one.  
That bastard must have dragged him here.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Right behind that knight.  
Behold.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The fourth Lord...  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
No. The fourth Lord is standing behind him. Look.  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Look! There she is! Bearer of the holy banner! She who foolishly calls herself a mediator, who speaks of God's blessing!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Servant Ruler!  
I know your true name&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Cursed Jeanne d'Arc! The woman who willingly came to the prison tower to stand in my way!  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
...Avenger.  
Yes, your words are true.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
I have come here to stop you.  
As one who was once a leader, I stand in your way.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Holy Maiden Jeanne!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She's the avatar of Wrath?  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
That's right! Jeanne d'Arc is the avatar of Wrath!  
You should know this by now!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
She believed in humanity, believed in God, and was betrayed and burned at the stake!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
An eternal flame must burn within her heart.  
No, that flame should be her core!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You should know sadness! You should be black flames of anger, hatred, and rage!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You! You are the one most worthy of the fourth judgment!  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
No, Avenger.  
I never felt wrath.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
I will not judge Fujimaru.  
I lack the right, and the will.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
Even if I did not manifest here properly... it matters not.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...What?  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
It is you, Avenger.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
Poor, raging soul who is destined to hate the world and humanity forever.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
I will save you. Just as the holy banner still shines within the Château d'If.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
SHUT UP!  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
Jeanne, please stand back! My blade belongs to you and God, and now is the time to wield it!  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
Gilles!  
No, he needs my&mdash;  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
That dark presence! That black hatred! In this prison tower, even the salvation of the Lord cannot reach his soul!  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
Oh Holy Maiden, that is not the soul you think it is!  
A soul gone mad must be judged by the blade!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hahahahaha! That's right! I am an Avenger, from beyond the horizon of love and hatred!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Everyone says that is what I must be.  
They tell me to hate, to kill, to bury all my foes!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
And so that is what I shall be! I shall exact my vengeance on the world, as you wish me to!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
My beloved Haydée isn't here, nor is the noble Abbé Faria. So even God cannot save my soul!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Haydée? Abbé Faria?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You too! My temporary Master, you won't save me either!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You cannot! These black flames shall never disappear!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Haha! Hahahaha!  
Hahahahahahaha!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Say it in a way I can understand!  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Yes, you're right!  
I'm saying I'll kill the fourth lord for you!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I shall tear her banner of hope in two!  
Her light, her holiness, they mean nothing to me!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
That which is noble! That which is holy!  
It's all equally worthless!  
  
   
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
...I have no choice.  
I cannot stop you with words.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
I will fight.  
Gilles, lend me your power!  
  
   
**Gilles de Rais:**   
As you wish! Oh Holy Maiden, may victory go with you and the banner of the Lord's light!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hahahaha! Come! Come!  
I always wondered what God thought of me!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Listen, Master! No matter what she says, she is a lord of the Hall of Judgment!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Thus, you must fight, and win!  
If you want to survive&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;Kill that Holy Maiden!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
...It's the story of a man.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
The man was a sailor in Marseille.  
A happy man betrothed to a beautiful woman.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
But the man fell victim to a cruel trap.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
He was falsely convicted...  
And sentenced for the crime of treason.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
No one came to his aid.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
He was denounced in secret,  
betrayed by an old friend.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
Even the judge became his enemy out of greed.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
And the man...was sent to a prison tower in the bay of Marseille.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
Yes. The prison tower. The island of despair.  
The Château d'If, from which no one returns alive.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
He was trapped inside a living hell,  
his days and years stolen from him.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
Sometimes the man wished that he might starve to death, so great was his despair.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
And then...  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
There was someone to give him a bit of guidance.  
An ancient wise man imprisoned there, Abbé Faria.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
The Abbé brought him hope. He was a tiny light shining at the bottom of the darkness.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
The man learned much from the Abbé,  
and when the priest died he escaped.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
He took the place of the Abbé's corpse in its bag, and escaped from the prison.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
By the time he made it out... fourteen years had passed.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
With the treasure of Monte Cristo, he began his revenge.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
He enacted revenge upon those who had forgotten him for fourteen years. On the cruel world which had allowed his betrayal.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
The man took the life of those who had sent him to that hell one by one...  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
...Yes, it is a very cruel, brutal story.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
But the people loved it. They applauded him for bringing righteous wrath against evil.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
He called himself the Count of Monte Cristo.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
The one man to return alive from the living hell made by man and society.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
The man who abandoned pity, ethics, and everything good in the human heart, and chose revenge.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
He... He is the world's most well-known seeker of vengeance.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
His name is&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Haha! Hahahahahahaha!  
A mere fragment of a soul!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...You cannot extinguish the flames of my vengeance! Behold! Your knight has fallen in battle!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
And now it's your turn!  
Jeanne, you false saint!  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
...I admit it.  
This battle is yours.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
But I won't give up.  
I will stop you. All of your plans&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
She's gone! Haha!  
There's nowhere to run! Someday I will kill you!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
This is the Château d'If!  
None can ever return alive!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Haha! Hahaha!  
HAHAHAHAHAHA!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who are you, Avenger?  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...Why are you asking this now?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I am the one who guides your soul.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I didn't tell you where we're going, did I? Oh, it's not to the Lord whom that Saint and her knight worship.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I will only take you to one place... A place beyond the horizon of love and hatred.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Whether you give up or not, your soul is going there.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
When that happens, will you return alive? Or...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Will you be trapped forever, despair, go mad, and die?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Look forward to it.  
I know. That is what I should have said.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;Wait. And hope.  
  
   
## 5th Door: Heartless Moonlight  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
...I'm sorry?  
You asked where Avenger went?  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Um, he just left. He said something about scouting outside.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
He should be back soon.  
He said there's no need to follow him.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Outside always seems the same.  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Does it?  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
No, I never leave this cell...  
But it's strange.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
The hallway beyond these bars never changes.  
It always just goes one way.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
But at the end of it, there's always a different Lord in the Hall of Judgment, they say.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
...Avenger says that the hallway, and the Hall of Judgment, change each day.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
You're getting further each day.  
Deeper and deeper in.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
This cell moves deeper, along with you.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
That's what Avenger said.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Avenger's actually a nice guy.  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
...You're right.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
He may be rough with his words,  
but he doesn't seem to dislike you.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
In fact...  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
No, never mind.  
Perhaps I'm imagining it.  
  
   
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
...You're fighting every day, aren't you?  
With the Lords in the Hall of Judgment.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
The day you saved me, it was like something out of a myth.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
The way you fought that monster who called itself Fergus...  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
It was like an ancient hero. It didn't seem real.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Avenger said that the souls gathered here were trapped by something.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Even Heroic Spirits... Powerful souls greater than humans...  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
I'm nothing like that.  
I couldn't be a Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
But I... I'm here in Château d'If as well...  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
I am a trapped soul. Perhaps I was chosen as the avatar of some sin, too.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's probably the work of the King of Mages.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It might just be bad luck.  
   
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Thank you, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
I wonder if anyone can truly exist without sin.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Anger, envy... The degrees may vary, but they're both the workings of a functional mind.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
If they are sins, who but God could judge them?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Have you awakened, my temporary Master?  
Then stand.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Let us go. The fifth Lord awaits you.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
...Lost one.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
To be lost and uncertain is man's destiny.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
But perhaps it's not quite right for me to speak of what life should be.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Hmmph. I see surprise in your eyes. My madness is a gift of the lunar goddess, and sometimes it is lost.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
It doesn't happen normally, but this is the pit of hell. Even the goddess' eyes cannot see you here.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
...But without madness, I cannot touch my beloved child. It is upsetting.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
I manifest as a Berserker class.  
I am not allowed to speak without madness.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Only here, as your body and soul separate ever further, can I speak to you.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Oh, Nero&mdash; Beloved child, the living image of my sister Agrippina.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Please, please... Enjoy some happiness, no matter how small.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
I shall take with me madness and rage.  
May the path you tread be filled with roses of blessing.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
...I'm sorry. I should be speaking to you, but instead my lips speak of my beloved niece.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Nero's great, huh?)  
   
**Caligula:**   
...I can see your thoughts in your eyes.  
Yes. Yes, you're very right.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(I understand.)  
   
**Caligula:**   
Yes. ...Yes.  
  
   
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, kyau, kyaaau!  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Oh, beautiful beast! Will you guide me?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Yes, there is little time.  
I must speak to you, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
&mdash;Have you ever tried to devour everything?  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Have you ever eaten and eaten and been unfulfilled, as if you were a starving man?  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Have you consumed and consumed, making yourself a slave to the hunger of the soul?  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
I have.  
  
   
Or was that all I was?  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
I ate. I consumed. I filled my unloved body with my desires.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
The sin of Gluttony.  
The malignant tumor of Rome.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
...My life may have been evil.  
Indeed, I'm sure that's what later generations said.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
The moon goddess may have toyed with me, or perhaps I was born evil.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
But my soul was carved into history as a Heroic Spirit, not an Anti-Hero. And that...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
I must believe that somewhere in my heart, some tiny bit of love was left.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
And thus&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I'll tell you who this Lord really is...  
He is the avatar of Gluttony.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
An avatar of evil, who devours all the pleasures of the world and still seeks more.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Thus, he should be a very simple opponent.  
No need for complexities like last time.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
There's no need to think at all.  
You will win, if you stay true to yourself.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...Kill. All you have to do is kill.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
...Gggggaaahhaaaaaaahhh...  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Wooaaahh...  
Ooooh...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
ROOOAAARRRH!  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
I will... kill... kill!  
Oh... Oh goddess... Forgive my deeds!  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
My deeds are... fate!  
I will...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
DEVOUR EVERYTHING!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Caligula!  
   
**Caligula:**   
...OOHHHHHH...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Where is Nero...  
Oh, please... Please, just let her...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
ROOAAARHH!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I just met you...  
   
**Caligula:**   
???  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
What are you? Would you stop me? I am... Emperor...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
I will eat! I can't even taste it anymore! But I will eat!  
I don't even know why anymore, but...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
The goddess Diana has allowed it all!  
  
   
My deeds...are...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
...I will simply...obey... fate!  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hahaha! It seems he has failed to calm himself!  
He will not stop until he devours your soul!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Feel free to keep talking to him.  
If you want to die here, go right ahead.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You can stop going forward whenever you like. You can always give up.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
But your soul...doesn't seem to want to give up!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Look, here he comes!  
If you don't want to die, then move!  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
ROOAAARRRHHHH!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
If you want to survive...  
Kill! All that stands in your way is your enemy!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Caligula:**   
&mdash;And thus...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Because I believe in that tiny remnant of love. Because I should be an Anti-Hero, but am a Heroic Spirit...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
I put some tiny bit of feeling into my mad screams.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
It's so small...  
But this is how I resist my cursed fate.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
...Fujimaru.  
Even I can do this.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
So one who knows love cannot fall.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
I believe in you, child who keeps going forward.  
  
   
## 6th Door: Vengeance is Mine...  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
The sixth judgment. The sixth Lord&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You will see for yourself that human desire has no limits.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I've never seen a man more greedy than he.  
It is astonishing.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Even the man who tried to offer his own daughter for wealth, money, and riches comes nowhere near him.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
His greed is for the world itself.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You sound like you're having fun.  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...Fun, you say?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hmmph. That's how I look to you?  
Then I must have very wicked tastes.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
First there was sorrow and tears. Then pain and suffering. Then he arrived to a great wish that could be called greed.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
It was never achieved, but his vengeance was the purest and noblest in the world.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You would say I find that&mdash;fun.  
  
   
But I do not deny it. I have given up all that is good in me.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
What is left must be like a demon.  
One who mocks the noble wishes of man.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Haha. Hahaha. Fascinating!  
Indeed, you may be right.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you like him(?)?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hmmph. Yes. I've never thought about it, but perhaps I do.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
He sought an answer. If there was no true righteous man in the world, he said...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Or perhaps you could say he believed in nobility, and in human good, and thus denied a world where evil reigned?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
We will never know. Though, perhaps someone like you could understand him.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Yes, he is the man who tried to do good for the entire world.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
He's very like you.  
He tried to save the world.  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Either way&mdash;  
I have a certain respect for him.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
His boldness. His nobility. His greed!  
They are worthy of acclaim!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
And thus...and thus...  
With the greatest respect...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
My black flames shall destroy them all. My flames burn brightest against righteousness and noble wishes.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Be prepared, Master. You...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You must crush this Greed that would devour the world. Kill, or be killed.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
To put it simply, yes&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
He is a tough foe. Let your guard down, and you will die.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
...You're here then, Avenger.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
Last time I was defeated, but this time I've made my decision. I will defeat you, and stop you.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
I believe now that this is the way to guide you.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
No, no, no!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Yes, I won't let you escape. I'll kill you someday.  
But not now! You're interrupting me, Holy Maiden!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Your timing is almost as bad as Caderousse!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why are you so mad at her?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...You don't like Jeanne?  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
It's because of who I am!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
If she refuses to admit the existence of wrath, it's the same as denying my existence!  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
Keep raging, Avenger.  
Rage is, as you say&mdash;  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
Not easily dispersed. I can understand that.  
I've seen it many times.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
Your anger will burn brightly, like straw set to flame.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
Until it burns the one who rages, and much of what surrounds him, to cinders.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
But...even if there is rage in your heart...  
You can still wish for forgiveness and salvation.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Shut up! You would speak to me of forgiveness and salvation?  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
Yes, because&mdash;  
You have experienced it once for yourself, right?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Haha...hah...! Hahahahahaha!  
BWAHAHAHAHA!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
“That” is not me!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Do not speak of my vengeance, woman!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
My black flames seek not salvation!  
My rage brings no forgiveness!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
“Tyger, tyger, burning bright. For if you travel to the horizon beyond love and hatred.”  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I am the Count of Monte Cristo! An eternal avenger!  
A wicked shadow carved into mankind's history!  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
He truly is the Avenger of Château d'If.  
The man who returned to Paris and had his revenge...  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
His true name is Edmond Dantès.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
In his bloody revenge, he also called himself...  
The Count of Monte Cristo&mdash;  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
It must be the same name as the hope given to him by the Abbé, the treasure of Monte Cristo.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
But...  
His deeds brought only despair.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
Even beyond the horizon of love and hatred, his rage continued to burn bright.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
The Count of Monte Cristo.  
It is the name of a devil born only to seek revenge.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I understand now, Holy Maiden.  
You and I can never get along!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
So I'll kill you here! I shall show you the true form of my resentment and grudge!  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
!!!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Some feelings cannot be shared by mere words.  
Holy Maiden, you should know this well.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
...I know. I know.  
But I just can't give up.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
&mdash;And that is why God still loves you, I'm sure.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;I've been waiting for you, other Ruler!  
Avatar of Greed!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I see. What a wonderful idea!  
Meet an exception with an exception!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
One Avenger and two Rulers.  
Interesting. Truly interesting.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Servant Ruler!  
Amakusa Shirou Tokisada!  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
&mdash;Hello, Avenger.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
In a different place, we might have had a very different meeting.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
You call yourself the Christ of Vengeance.  
Words and prayers will not reach you, I'm sure.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
But I believe in you.  
More than you could know.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
???  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
If you know what a living hell is, then you should know what is truly valuable.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
You did not join in the King of Mages' plan. Therefore...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;Shut up.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
He has no hatred in him. I've no interest in a being that exists outside of love and hatred.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Don't get the wrong idea about me, Amakusa Shirou.  
I've never helped save the world.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...That's true.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Oh well. I don't like fights, but I guess this is how I shall guide you.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Jeanne d'Arc. I'll ask for your help. As a fellow Ruler, not as one placed in the Château d'If.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
&mdash;Of course, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Thank you.  
  
   
...Do you feel a little conflicted about this?  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
We can forget the past for now.  
I want to save him. As do you.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
So we must fight together, and there is no better ally I could ask for than you.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're fighting two Rulers?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
They have two, and we have one, huh?  
it does seem we're at a disadvantage, then.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
But that's wrong, Master!  
I have you, and your Servants!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
This is the Château d'If! God's light does not reach here, and he will not play favorites!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...It's like we're the bad guys!  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hahahahahaha! That's a funny joke.  
Nothing could be more ironic, Master!  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I once learned that God does not save us!  
So now I will kill you, the avatars of His salvation!  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
I don't know about that&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Let's go, Master.  
You and I are as one, now.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Here in the Château d'If, where there is no salvation, if one continues to hope, and truly wants to go home...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
They must be guided!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
And I shall be the one to guide you!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I'm going back to Chaldea!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I know that already!  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hahahahahaha!  
Yes! Yes! You roar like a tiger too!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;Kill! Steal! Take back all that is yours!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...Avenger.  
We wish to save you.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Both Jeanne d'Arc and I fought for the same reason. ...Am I right, Holy Maiden?  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
Yes... But once again I wasn't strong enough&mdash;  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Vengeance is not man's to perform.  
One does not need to refer to scripture to know this.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
This is neither a prediction nor a prophecy,  
but a statement from me to you, Avenger.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Those black flames will someday destroy you as well.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Are those your last words, Rulers?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Even God himself cannot change my state as an eternal Avenger. Do you speak, knowing that?  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
...Nothing is eternal.  
Evil, in particular.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Weak. Weak. What weakness!  
I cannot even bring myself to laugh!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Know that weakness is what trapped you here as avatars of Wrath and Greed!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
If you had manifested in your true forms, you would not have been so easily...  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
No, I won't say it. We'll meet again in another hell.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You who do not lose your nobility, even here.  
I mock your God, but I do not mock you.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You, Holy Maiden who forgives all without Wrath. And you, Saint of Greed, who stands against an evil world.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;Farewell.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
...I pray your soul...  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...finds rest, somewhere far from here.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...I've kept you waiting, my temporary Master.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Only one Hall of Judgment remains.  
Perhaps you shall return alive after all.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
If you never give up, and you keep killing and pressing on, that is.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Were we really supposed to defeat them?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;Who can say?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Their interest was in me. If they'd gotten what they wanted, what would've happened to you?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Perhaps you would've been saved.  
Perhaps you would have been trapped here forever.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
There's no way to tell now, though!  
Whichever it was, you can do nothing but believe me!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Silence)  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...Hmm. I like the look on your face.  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
We're going back to your cell.  
This time, even I'm feeling tired&mdash;  
  
   
## 7th Door: The Count of Monte Cristo  
   
**F：???:**  
...The man was saved, in the end.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
When he finally achieved his bloody revenge, he abandoned all the evil he'd built up.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
He regained once more the nobility he thought he'd lost.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
His emotions. His love&mdash; His human goodness.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
The man's name... His name, after he threw away the name of Count of Monte Cristo...  
  
   
**F：???:**  
He became Edmond Dantès. The man who regained love, even after becoming a terrible avenger.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
As he threw aside his revenge and set out on a journey, they say you could see a foreign princess at his side.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
But...  
But now he is...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Kyuu, fou...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, Fou. It's fine.  
I'm sure Senpai will wake up tomorrow.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We can't let ourselves get down.  
We must stay strong.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
When Senpai wakes up, we can't be seen feeling sad.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, kyuu!  
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I think so. We need to be ready for Senpai to come back at any time&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...Where is the woman?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hmmph. Don't look so confused.  
The woman. The one I called Mercédès.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Where'd she go while I was gone?  
There's no place to go in the Château d'If.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? She disappeared...  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You've no idea then, I guess.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The Hall of Judgment, maybe?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Yes, that's the only part of this hell that you know.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
But the prison tower you've seen is only a small part of the whole that is the Château d'If.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You have all you need, but there are many other wonderful rooms inside it.  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...Well, it doesn't matter.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Let's go. Get ready. The last Hall of Judgment has been prepared.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Kill the seventh Lord. Do not hesitate. Do not be uncertain. There is only one path, anyways.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You are very lucky.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Not only that I'm personally at your side, but that you know naught of most of the hells within this place.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Something must love you very much.  
A rain of tortures do not assault your senses.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
The screams of the imprisoned and dying do not assault your sense of hearing.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
The endless stench of death does not assault your sense of smell.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's a good thing.  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hah! You're right about that!  
You're right about that indeed.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How do you know so much about this place?  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Because of what I am. This is different in several ways from the real Château d'If...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...and in many ways its closer to what I am.  
Neverending grudge has altered its very essence.  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...Well, whatever the reason...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...the only thing that assails you is the Halls of Judgment. Not that I envy you&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
But you walk a very different path than I do.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;Hmmph.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No one's here?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Didn't you say it was prepared?  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Let me tell you an old story.  
It'll help pass the time.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...I'd love a smoke, but I suppose I'll do without.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
It's a simple old story. But some say it's the greatest tale of revenge the world has ever known.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
There once was a fool who lived by the sea.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
He was an honest man.  
He didn't know that the world was full of evil.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
That was how the man fell into a trap.  
He was falsely convicted and sent to the Château d'If...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
He spent fourteen years in that hell,  
and when he escaped alive&mdash;he became an avenger.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
He threw aside all that was good in man,  
and attained the cunning and power of a devil.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
In his wrath, the man put all he had into his revenge.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
One by one he terrified and slew all those who had sent him to that hell.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Heh...  
Oh, I can still remember their faces!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
The shock when I told them my name! The despair when the evil deeds they'd forgotten came back to haunt them!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Haha&mdash;Hahahahahahaha!  
That was true vengeance! Righteous revenge!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Was that man you, Avenger?  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hmmph. Don't be in such a hurry.  
Let your elders finish their stories.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
But that's most of what I have to say.  
The man achieved his revenge, but let the last one go.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...Some say he abandoned his wickedness.  
They say at the very end, he regained his goodness.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;That he gained love.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Why are you so mad?  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...The man did indeed stop seeking revenge.  
He probably did regain the love he lost.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
He disappeared, along with the captive princess who had loved him.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A happy ending.  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Yes, it was.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I've heard that story somewhere...  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...I'm sure you have. A wicked author wrote it all down, and it became known throughout the world.  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
The man's life became a story.  
Or perhaps the story was his life.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Whichever way it was&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
The story received unparalleled acclaim, and countless emotions turned it into a myth of revenge.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Once the man cried out for the god of vengeance, but sadly, in the end, became that god himself.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
The man's place was carved into history, in the vengeful form that existed in man's imagination.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
His soul became a Heroic Spirit, and when the King of Mages tried to incinerate time itself&mdash;  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
...It became a very unique Servant.  
An Extra Class.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
&mdash;And that's you, isn't it Avenger?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
In the end, I...  
I never did remember who I was.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
But I know you.  
I don't know why, but I know you.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mercédès?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you the seventh  
   
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Hello, Fujimaru.  
No, not you.  The one in black, I...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Move!  
I prefer not to kill women.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're kidding me!  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...Hmmph.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You went all out with Jeanne.  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
That was a Ruler. A human fortress.  
In body and soul, she's far too sturdy to be a woman.  
  
   
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
This tower is a wicked thing, and so are you, Avenger.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
You...cannot be allowed to exist in this world.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;Oh, interesting.  
Another woman uttering those same words, eh?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Mercédès. No, no, woman who has lost herself and wanders. Would you deny me? Here in the Château d'If?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You are no weak woman. You are strong.  
Your strong soul rivals even that Holy Maiden.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Show me what you really are!  
If I must not be allowed to exist...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;Then reveal yourself!  
Use your full power to kill me!  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
I still don't know...  
Why, why am I here?  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
...But there are those who will lend me strength.  
  
   
**Wraith:**   
...We will lend you strength...woman...  
  
   
**Wraith:**   
...We are wraiths who could not become Heroic Spirits...  
  
   
**Wraith:**   
...But we have never forgotten you for a moment...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
A convergence of the curses within the Château d'If?  
No. There's no hatred. No rage.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Are those fragments of the souls that admire you? Hahaha! Splendid! Even the dead love you, woman!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You must have walked quite the path in life.  
Perhaps you are a famous Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
&mdash;But a wraith without hatred is just a whisper on the wind.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Wraith:**   
Moooaann!  
Avenger! Pitiful...me!  
  
   
**Wraith:**   
This woman is our light, our one salvation.  
You must not reject&mdash;even her!  
  
   
**Wraith:**   
No salvation... No salvation!  
At least, then, die! Like a moth burning at the flame!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
...Oh, don't force yourself to move.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Stay where you are.  
Though I doubt you could move at all.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Don't let it bother you.  
I've simply done what I felt I must.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Did the wraiths help me for the reason he said...  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Because of who I was in life?  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
I am supposed to be the Lord of the seventh Hall of Judgment. One of the obstacles set to slay you.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
For some reason I lost that role, as well as my memories.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
I still can't remember.  
But...  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
I pray that the light shines down upon your path.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
Much of what he says is lies, but one thing he said remains in my heart.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
“Attendre et espérer.” Wait and hope.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
...What sad words, but what a strong wish that lives within them...  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Hahahaha!  
Die! Die! Leave nothing behind!  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Without hatred, you are weak!  
True, you had an advantage over me&mdash;  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
But your blade could not touch me, woman.  
It was far too kind.  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
So it...seems...  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
I'm not the real Mercédès, but...  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
I pray that the light shines upon your path.  
Avenger... No...  
  
   
**C：Mercédès:**   
&mdash;Edmond Dantès.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's gone...  
   
**Avenger:**   
...Heh.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Was she a Heroic Spirit too?  
   
**Avenger:**   
...Who cares!?  
  
   
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Haha. Hahahahaha!  
How hilarious! Those were her last words?  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Me, Edmond?  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
No! No! First the Holy Maiden, then her! I am not him!  
I am not Edmond Dantès&mdash;  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
That's the name of a miserable, innocent prisoner. The name of a man who was saved...  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
...by a miraculous love&mdash;  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
That is not me.  
I am an Avenger! An eternal being of vengeance!  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
The name of a human who lived and died as a man!  
How could it be worthy of me?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that your True Name?  
   
  
   
**Avenger:**   
...We're done talking.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
The Château d'If's role will end soon.  
The seven judgments have been destroyed.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
All that's left is to go outside, into the sunlight. But...  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
No human has escaped the Château d'If.  
With one exception.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
It is the same even now that a million hatreds have reformed this place. Only one may leave.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But there are two people here.  
   
**Avenger:**   
Yes. Yes, there are&mdash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I figured this was coming.  
   
**Avenger:**   
Very perceptive.  
No, I suppose it's to be expected.  
  
   
  
   
**Avenger:**   
The one who remains shall become the new Abbé Faria.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
They will end their life as one who shatters despair and guides towards hope. It's a meaningful way to end one's life.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
You, or me.  
One of us will survive and one of us will die.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
&mdash;Come, my temporary Master. Prepare yourself.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Of course, I have no intention of dying.  
I was lucky enough to come back to this world.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
I will do as I please. I'll make you a second Abbé Faria, and live.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Your story will end. It's that simple.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Let us end this. In the last act of the play, your soul shall truly die.  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
But if...  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
If you say you will continue!  
If you have not yet lost hope!  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
&mdash;Then slay me!  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
To me belongeth Vengeance! I am the avatar of Pride, the Lord of the seventh Hall of Judgment!  
  
   
**Avenger:**   
Fight me, and save the world&mdash;  
Hold nothing back!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...Heh, heh.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Amazing. I see. You've learned how I fight...  
Your time as my temporary Master was well-spent.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hahaha! This feels good!  
Indeed! I wanted to taste this once!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
To be like the one person who gave me guidance...  
The noble Abbé Faria!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I... I can be a tiny light of hope...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
To an innocent person&mdash;  
who fell into a terrible trap&mdash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Edmond Dantès...  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...So you would call me that...too?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Avenger!  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Haha! That's right!  
You understand me, Master!  
  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I shall admit it! You have done me a favor by killing me! You have guided me to victory&mdash;  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You don't understand?  
...Yes, I'm sure.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I knew naught of victory.  
Even as I found my place in history as an Avenger...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Because Edmond was saved at the end...  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I, the one who failed to taste victory and achieve his revenge, continued to exist.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
But...you, Fujimaru. I guided you to victory, and you overcame the obstacles and escaped the prison tower.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
What an ending...  
...filled with hope.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
I was without victory, and you allowed me to guide you, and earn that victory.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You're so generous&mdash;Haha, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
“We” have won! Not even the King of Mages is all-powerful!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So this was Solomon's...  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Fool. You may speak of the King of Mages, but do not use his True Name carelessly.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
That name has become a curse. Just saying it aloud is enough to place that curse on you.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
That is how you came to be in this hell.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
You stared into his eyes in London, did you not?  
That was enough for him.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
It's called the Evil Eye.  
You were given a fatal poison then.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
He didn't let you go.  
He decided that you were already finished.  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
But&mdash;Haha! Hahaha!  
This was the result! Too bad, King of Mages!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Your single whim, your single cunning trap has met its end here!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
That's what you get for choosing me, you fool!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Walk forth! Keep struggling! You have been released...from this prison of the soul!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Someday you shall save the world!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Will you disappear forever?  
   
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
...You would wish to meet me, an Avenger, once more?  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
Hahaha! HAHAHAHA!  
Then there is but one thing I can say!  
  
   
**B：Avenger:**   
“Attendre et espérer.” Wait and hope!  
  
   
**A：???:**  
...Senpai!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou, kyauu!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai!  
It looks like Senpai's awake!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If I'm not dreaming, this means...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. Looks like a full recovery.  
Really, it's amazing...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good morning, Fujimaru You were asleep a long time. Do you have a headache?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, kyau!  
Kyuu!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai. Good morning.  
...I'm glad you're back.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm so glad&mdash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm home, Mash.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes&mdash; Welcome back, Senpai.
