# Halloween Comeback! Super Ghouls'n Pumpkins - The Seed of Adventure  
  
## Prelude  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
&mdash;We've finally made it here, me.  
Are you ready for this?  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Also, is my makeup on right?  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
...Of course, me. We'll defeat the witch and take back Castle Csejte!  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
And of course my makeup's perfect! It's me we're talking about!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Yup! By the way... Why are there two of us?  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
Well, it doesn't really matter,  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
If you ask me, by splitting into two, our idol coefficient's gone up several thousand times.  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
Even my idol frenemy got a bride costume so...  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
That's right! If there are two of her, there should be two of me!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Exactly! Smart thinking, me! And now, the most important thing, without a doubt, is...  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
...my new performance...  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
“Heartbreak★Castle Csejte Heaven and Hell Dual Concert - Sweet Bloody Halloween Special: What The... It's So Sweet!”  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
...is about to begin!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Ticket sales are projected to completely sell out!  
I had to reserve some tickets for Chaldea!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
As such, I can't let the schedule get messed up, now, can I?  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
...Which is why I need to take back the castle, me!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Okay, let's go!  
Ready, set, go!  
  
   
**Both:**   
Excuse me!  
  
   
**???:**  
Who's making all that noise? It's the middle of the night! Why can't you be quiet?  
  
   
**???:**  
...Hmm. Why, if it isn't two ugly little girls!  
  
   
**???:**  
Oooh... You little shrimp aren't very fashionable at all. What a sin it is to be like you!  
  
   
**???:**  
And I am disgusted. Disgusted!  
You cling to the glories of the past...  
  
   
**???:**  
You're so focused on something that you fail to see the bigger picture!  
  
   
**???:**  
Yet I will accept that my glory must have blinded you.  
So sorry!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Huh? Oh, uh, no. But thank you.  
  
   
**???:**  
Humph! Don't get the wrong idea. It's not like I was trying to be considerate or anything when I said that!  
  
   
**???:**  
Now get back to your dank little caves, you scrawny lizards!  
  
   
**???:**  
Because, as you're quite well aware, staying out late is very bad for the skin!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Tch... She gives off such a powerful aura just by standing there...! Her idol coefficient is really high like always!  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
Jeez! I understand why I would shake in the presence of a powerful enemy, but for now, just concentrate!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
I-I know that!  
Now get ready, witch!  
  
   
**???:**  
You make me laugh! I've never gotten myself ready for anything! Because&mdash;  
  
   
**???:**  
Because my heart is free as a feather!  
I have no worries about anything!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Ugh... this self-confidence and boastful attitude...  
She reminds me of someone...!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
She's like a woman I see every single morning... when I'm checking myself in the mirror...!  
  
   
**???:**  
And, obviously, the word “witch” is inappropriate for me.  
  
   
**???:**  
“Witch” in this region refers not to an embodiment of beauty such as me, but rather to that Halloween girl next to you, right?  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
This is just a stage outfit based on the concept of a witch! I'm the mistress of this castle!  
  
   
**???:**  
Hahaha!  
Hahahahahahaha!  
  
   
**???:**  
You may not look that great, but you've got a real sense of humor! It's tasteless, low-class, and ridiculous!  
  
   
**Both:**   
WHAT DID YOU SAY!?  
  
   
**???:**  
Hahaha. If you're telling me that the job of a castle mistress entails wearing a ridiculous outfit like that, even I can't help but laugh.  
  
   
**???:**  
Actually, I'm tired from laughing so much.  
I'm going to bed.  
  
   
**???:**  
I'm the owner of this castle now. Naturally, I am also assuming direct control of these lands as well.  
  
   
**???:**  
Being a ruler is much too difficult for tryhard lizards like the two of you! Now be good little commoners and quietly take your leave!  
  
   
**???:**  
Hahaha! But I don't know if freeloading nobles like you can handle the life of a commoner!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
What...!?  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
What did you say!?  
  
   
**???:**  
Don't scream at me.  
It's like listening to surround sound.  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Shut up!  
You took my Castle Csejte without asking!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
You're not even from the right culture anyway!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
You don't match Castle Csejte at all!  
  
   
**???:**  
...? Are you so excited that you haven't even bothered to look outside?  
  
   
**???:**  
Hahaha. It's too late.  
Behold the snake that foretells the end!  
  
   
**Both:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Both:**   
Something weird's sticking out!?  
  
   
**???:**  
Oh, you're back! Good evening!  
You do know I'm actually really busy?  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
What is that!?  
Why is my castle a pyramid!?  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Actually, why is the pyramid upside down!?  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
The castle's all smooshed! All you did was stack it on top! Talk about cutting corners!  
  
   
**???:**  
Hahaha, you've got me there, little lizards!  
But I'll tell you one thing:  
  
   
**???:**  
This is remodeling!  
  
   
**???:**  
Farewell to that nasty, disgusting prison castle!  
What this era wants is simplicity!  
  
   
**???:**  
The golden ratio is the basis of beauty in this world! That's right! Just like me! Exactly like me!  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
No, it looks really out of place. I mean, this is Europe... Besides, how is that “remodeling”!?  
  
   
**???:**  
Avant-garde!  
Hakone! Art park! Museum!  
  
   
**???:**  
Anyway, this castle is under my control!  
But I understand beauty. I'm not a monster.  
  
   
**???:**  
If you insist on holding a concert, out of respect for the former owners, I will offer you a place.  
  
   
**???:**  
Yes... I know exactly where!  
How about that stable?  
  
   
**???:**  
That's rock n' roll style right there! You can jam in the same kind of place that holy man was born in!  
  
   
**???:**  
Hahaha! It's fine, it's fine. No need to thank me with words! Just bow down before me in gratitude!  
  
   
**Both:**   
Hell no!!  
  
   
**???:**  
Humph. So negotiations failed, huh?  
...How disappointing.  
  
   
**???:**  
I guess I have no choice then.  
Behold my power!  
  
   
**???:**  
...Is what I'd like to say, but fighting directly isn't elegant. It's bad for my skin, too.  
  
   
**???:**  
So I'll leave that to my stand-in.  
Fierce, ugly knight of steel, come forth!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Tristan the Tragic has arrived.  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
What...?  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
As has Lancelot the Sorrowful.  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
No way...!  
  
   
**???:**  
Now then, I have to get back to my book.  
Finish them by the time I'm done, you losers!  
  
   
**???:**  
Of course, if you fail, you're banished. I have no use for men whose only redeeming quality is their beauty.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
How sad... You're underestimating our power, aren't you?  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
I agree with Tristan. We'll have this finished before you can read the next sentence.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Now then. It's time for you to go.  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
H-Hey, time out!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
We're here to fight with that nasty woman over there!  
  
   
**???:**  
A truly good mistress has talented retainers.  
Heh... I'm so perfect.  
  
   
**???:**  
Oh, I'll give you one last bit of advice.  
  
   
**???:**  
Remember this face, for it is my consolation to you.  
  
   
**???:**  
After all, they say seeing beautiful things makes you more beautiful, right?  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
Why, you...!  
Let's do this, me!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Wah!?  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
Funyah!?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Now go. We weren't told to take your lives.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
You cannot beat us, let alone our mistress.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
You need to grow at least 10 years older, cute little girls.  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
Waah! We lost to a couple of literal homewreckers!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
W-We'll get you for this!  
You COUGAR LOVER!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
We'll be back! Real soon!  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Hahaha. I look forward to it.  
Now let's go, Lord Tristan.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...Homewreckers...  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
(He's genuinely shocked that she called him that!)  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
(Panting)  
W-We made it out okay, somehow, but...  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
What do we do, me!?  
We can't hold our concert at this rate...  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
I hate to say it, but we can't handle this on our own.  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
...Uncle Vlad is away on business...  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
And Tamamo Cat said, “Woof! I'm leaving on a journey for paws unknown!” and quit her job.  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
By the way, do you think she was lying about why she quit? Were we tricked?  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
It doesn't matter.  
No, I mean, it does matter, but...  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Waah! If only my [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] were here!  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
No sense in complaining about what we can't have.  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
Ugh! I'm so pathetic, relying on others and whatnot!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Humph. S-So what, me!?  
Do you have any good ideas?  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
N-No, but...  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Then stop complaining!  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
Wh-What!? You don't have any ideas either, do you?  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
You're stupid, so just shut up!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Argh!  
You're me, so you're stupid too!  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
I'm a Caster, which makes me one rank higher than you in intelligence!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
There is no such stat!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
...And you know what? I'm not sure it's a good idea for Caster me to be one rank lower in MP either!  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
Gah! You know that's a sore spot for me!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
What, you wanna fight!?  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
 ＆＄＃〓％＆∧§’（＆（％＆））!!!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
 ”）※＄〓〓＊｀％”～’＄’％＃!!!  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**B：Elisabeth:**   
Huh? What's this light?  
  
   
**A：Elisabeth:**   
Huh? Huh? What!?  
  
   
**Both:**   
((Wait! What happened!?))  
  
   
**Both:**   
...  
  
   
**Both:**   
WHAT IS THIS!?  
  
   
## Section 1: "The Power of Friendship"  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay, let's start the briefing!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, you seem more excited than usual.  
Did something good happen?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Anyway, let's start the briefing!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's the matter, Roman?  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What? Aren't I always like this?  
Haha, or maybe it's because I've been staying up late lately.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, sorry I haven't been able to help you out even though we're in such a tense situation.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...That's suspicious...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, what's wrong, Fujimaru?  
You're looking at me strange.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hahaha, maybe you're tired? Still, this is all to save the world, so I want you to do your best!  
  
   
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Now Fou's looking at the doctor suspiciously.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Is there something you're hiding from us?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Actually, why is the staff surrounding us right now?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Well, a minor Singularity has been detected, see...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Obviously we can't just leave it there.  
I would like you to investigate and correct it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...So like what we always do?  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes. Master and I are all ready to go.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Now I don't think anything will hinder this mission, but...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you hiding something?  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...All right. In any event, please enter the Coffins!  
Get ready to Rayshift!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor!?  
  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The briefing's over, so you need to head over there now!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wait, Doctor! You still haven't told us where we're Rayshifting to!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Oh, someone dropped some documents here.  
This won't do at all.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Um, your Rayshift destination...  
Um, how do you read this again? Uh... I think it was...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Castle Csejte.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah that's it! Got it?  
Time to head out!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor! Did you just mention that one castle name we can never just let slide!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...The nightmare returns...  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh that's right! It's almost Halloween!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It was supposed to be a cordial gathering, but last year's Death Concert is still haunting us!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, it's too dangerous! That music will destroy your psyche if you continuously listen to it!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
All right, Mash! Dismissed!  
   
**Mash:**   
Right!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I have only a bad feeling about this, so I'm going to take a voluntary leave of absence!  
  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's not going to work! All staff, scrum!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Once we save the world, I'll personally review your current salary!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's time to show them the muscle you've gained from training with Leonidas!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-That's not fair, Doctor!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fouuu!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's do it! Crouch! Bind! Set!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Force them in!  
  
   
**C：Chaldea Staff:**   
   
Yeah!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Eep!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why you...! We'll come and haunt you!  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fine! When you do, I'll welcome you with some pumpkin dishes!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So the Doctor is the final boss!?  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hey! Don't go starting rumors about me!  
  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In any event, head out!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Go, uh, keep Elisabeth company again this year!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Meaning, just go to her concert, okay? Nothing makes an idol like her sadder than an empty venue! And you shouldn't make idols cry!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Here, I'll even give you some of my glow sticks!  
Now then, commence forced Rayshift!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're here...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, the Rayshift succeeded.  
Looks like Fou is here too.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Now I'm depressed...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I didn't think we would come here again...  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Communications seem fine.  
Doctor, the Rayshift succeeded.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
However, we won't let this slide.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I kind of hope that you will... Anyway, how are things looking over there?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It looks like...a graveyard.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We can get back at the doctor later.  
Let's keep moving for now.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sorry, Master.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If I remember correctly, last year when we came here, there were ghosts all over the forest.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We're in a graveyard, but I don't see any ghosts.  
I wonder what's going on.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm. I'm getting a reaction of some kind.  
It's very close to you.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hmm... Bugs.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Completely unrelated to Halloween, but a nuisance nonetheless.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's take them out!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Phew. The battle is over. Everything has been annihilated, so it should safe.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Shall we head into town, Master? Although I'm pretty sure Servants are going to show up and get in our way...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So our reward is box seats at the concert...  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, don't be discouraged.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It'll be fine. I'll be with you!  
We are one as Master and Servant!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This sucks.  
   
**Mash:**   
Up until now you were so optimistic about everything!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It'll be fine. When we get back... Yes, when we get back we'll have Amadeus play us some music!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We can request some really soothing music to listen to...  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like you're remotivated to continue the mission. Thank goodness...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Now, let's head towards town!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou, what's wrong?  
...Could it be...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't look behind you.  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-That's right! What you don't see can't hurt you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Run!  
   
**Mash:**   
W-We're just going to start running!?  
Wait, Master! Master!  
  
   
  
   
**???:**  
Achoo!  
  
   
**???:**  
...Heh. It looks like my stealth Rayshifting worked. Hehehe... Be afraid! Be very afraid!  
  
   
**???:**  
Achoo!  
  
   
**???:**  
...It's so cold. I didn't know the mountains in the West were this cold... That's a problem... I guess I'm dressed a bit too light...?  
  
   
## Section 2: "Hero Elly Gathers Allies"  
   
**Mash:**   
...That's strange.  
The town doesn't feel like Halloween at all.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Still, it doesn't seem like it was attacked or anything either.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And all the house lights are on, but I don't see any townspeople walking around...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Actually, Mash...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes? ...Hmm? Up in the sky?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um... What!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The castle...!  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? What is it, Master?  
What about the castle?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Umm...  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Castle Csejte...! What a mess!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And on top there's a pyramid...and it's upside down!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's just sitting there, Senpai!  
Like, boom!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I checked it out. The pyramid and the castle are from different epochs.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The former is obviously older. And the fact that it's crushing the castle like that means...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's not her?  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Right. I've never heard of her having anything to do with pyramids.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So no concert!?  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru, you sound way too excited. Anyway, that pyramid must be the source of the Singularity.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
What should we do, Master?  
Head up there?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's gather intel first.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, but it might be difficult to ask the townsfolk for information...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Hmm? A tavern, you say? ...I see.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Neither of us can have alcohol, but let's go.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We should head for a tavern.  
   
**Mash:**   
I see...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
People let their guard down when there's alcohol around. They're more likely to talk... even with newcomers like us.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All right! Let's go!  
  
   
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Welcome♪  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Umm.  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
My my, such young customers.  
Welcome to Mata Hari's tavern!  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Your one-stop shop for bittersweet meetings and farewells!  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Are you seeking traveling companions?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
C-Companions?  
No, we're fine.  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Oh, is that so.  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Then perhaps that cute [♂ guy /♀ girl] with you came to find some other kind of companionship?  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
I wouldn't mind spending the night with you, you know...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, we're fine!  
Right, Senpai!? Right!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
R-Right.  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
That's too bad.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Actually, we'd like to ask about that pyramid...  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Oh yes, the pyramid.  
It fell from the sky one day. It really was sudden.  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Inside it you'll find a queen and the loyal knights who serve her.  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
They banned Halloween.  
Can you believe it?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Banned... Halloween!?  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
There was a notice from the queen.  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
“If you object to the way I rule, if you're a reckless savage that dreams of getting rich fast, come and challenge this pyramid.”  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
...So she has declared.  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
And so this town is searching for heroes to do just that&ndash;to take on Pyramid Csejte.  
  
   
**Warrior:**   
I'll do it! I'm going to get rich off the pyramid's treasure!  
  
   
**Knight:**   
Leave the defending to me, you guys!  
  
   
**Monk:**   
We need a mage! I'm a priest that only knows how to heal using mundane means!  
  
   
**Thief:**   
Heh, leave any doors and chests to me!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So many people from so many different lands... I see.  
No wonder it's so lively.  
  
   
**???:**  
...  
  
   
**Sign:**   
“Please take me home!”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Act like you don't... notice...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're going to leave nice and quiet.  
   
  
   
**???:**  
(Starry eyed)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, it's too late.  
She's noticed us. She's positively glowing!  
  
   
**???:**  
[♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]! Hey there! Heeeeeey!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
L-Let's make a run for it, Master!  
  
   
**???:**  
Wait! Hey, waaaaaiiit!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She's chasing after us!  
Also, I think I just saw a familiar face!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Maybe that was just my imagination!  
But we don't have time for that!  
  
   
**???:**  
Waaaaaiiiiit!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master! Master!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It was basic survival instinct that made us flee, but maybe we should at least listen to what she has to say!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Y-Yeah! It's bound to be one of the causes of this Singularity, after all!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry, I just couldn't help it...!  
   
**Mash:**   
Last year's Halloween must be a great source of trauma for you, Master...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash is right, but...!  
   
**Mash:**   
No, I get it. Our feet just started moving of their own accord!  
  
   
  
   
**???:**  
You made me fall over! That hurt!  
Don't leave me behiiiiiiind!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master... I hear crying... from behind us...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Goodbye, eardrums...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hello, Halloween...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Okay... Let's head back.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Fou, fou!  
  
   
**???:**  
What do you want? I have a broken heart, you know...  
Oh, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!  
  
   
**???:**  
Oh, come on! So you did hear me!  
  
   
**???:**  
I'm not happy about this at all!  
  
   
**???:**  
You made me so worried!  
You should be punished!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Is that you, Elisabeth...?  
  
   
**???:**  
Have you forgotten!?  
  
   
**???:**  
It's me, the celebrated diva, praised as a talent that only comes once every thousand years, an unbridled genius!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Elisabeth the Crimson Hero!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou-bah!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where's Lancerbeth and Casteli?  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Why the nicknames!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...They're not around anymore.  
They're alive in my heart.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
To be more specific, we fused together.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou seems to be shocked at how far removed from a Servant she's become.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A swimsuit? At this time of year?  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right. The swimsuit event is over, Elisabeth.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What? Wait, you had a swimsuit event without me!? Where was my invite!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's not fair! That's not fair at all!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Well, let's forget about that for now.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Let's not!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I want to know precisely why no one called me!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see. So dual Elisabeths were driven out of Castle Csejte by this queen.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Yeah, exactly.  
Now do you understand?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
The LanCas duo couldn't finish what they started.  
So now there's something I must do... For their sake.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In other words, once more&ndash;  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's right!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That cursed pyramid has destroyed my concert hall!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'm going to take it out and overthrow the queen within! That is the mission of the Crimson Hero Elisabeth!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So that's what's going to happen this time...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. I see. That's why there are tons of adventurers in the tavern.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Crimson Hero...  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou's trying to say something, but it's best not to translate it.  
  
   
  
   
**???:**  
There she is! Surround her!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh? What's going on?  
This is...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Elisabeth, who are these people?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
The queen's lackeys!  
Be careful! They're all pretty strong!  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
We are knights in the queen's service.  
We fight to purge Halloween.  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
Those who speak of or desire to bring back Halloween shall be exiled or sentenced to hard labor, without exception!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's terrible...!  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
And we also received a complaint that this girl over here... is, um... not wearing appropriate attire in public...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's not true! I'm quite obviously dressed as a hero! ...Wait, I am, right!?  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
(Ahem)  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
In any event, it's exile or hard labor.  
You're going to have to pick one!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I don't have to be afraid of you any longer!  
Come, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]! We're going to fight!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wait.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Can you at least tell us why Halloween was banned?  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
Because, uh... Because the queen ordered it!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Then we'd like to ask the queen why.  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
The world's most lovely queen will not hold an audience with the likes of you!  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
Sorry, but we're going to restrain you!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Like hell you are!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
If you're going to stand in the way of my concerts and everything I stand for...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...I don't care who you are.  
I'll use every ounce of my strength to defeat you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like there's no way around it.  
Let's go, Master!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
By the way... Do you keep seeing someone lurking around here?  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
W-We've failed...! Retreat! Retreat!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We sent them running, but... they were all quite skilled.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A queen adored by knights of such caliber...  
I wonder what she's like.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We'll probably need to meet her if we're going to repair the Singularity.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Now, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet], you're going to help me, right!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fujimaru has joined the party!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Th-Thank goodness...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Thank you... I'm so moved, I want to dance and sing right at this moment.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Not necessary, let's move!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Eh!? Fast much!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Whatever. Anyway...!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
The legend of the Crimson Hero Elisabeth is going to start right here! That witch needs to brace herself!  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Crimson Hero Elisabeth's Adventure has begun!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So why were you in the tavern with that sign?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh, that? All I did was say this to the owner lady:  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
“Now then! I'm looking for some strong, radiant companions! Ones who will put me in the spotlight and worship me!”  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
“I'll be on vocals. I've never been in a band before. Looking for pros on guitar, bass, and drums.”  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
When I did, she smiled and just handed the sign to me! Isn't that mean!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I guess it serves you right...  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Your Majesty, we have confirmed visitors from Chaldea. It seems they were caught in the Bounded Field that was put up.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...  
  
   
**???:**  
Ha! Oh, I am so perfect, I predicted all of this!  
I of course have countermeasures in place!  
  
   
**???:**  
With the ultimate gatekeeper on watch, my superiority cannot be challenged... Oh, it's too beautiful...  
  
   
**???:**  
I rule this land appropriately, with tolerance and ruthlessness.  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
I-If I may, Your Majesty... Will Halloween continue to be banned?  
  
   
**???:**  
Dunce! How about going to a salon and cleaning up your dull look first!  
  
   
**???:**  
It's too soon for the common fools to celebrate Halloween!  
  
   
**???:**  
Holding such a lighthearted festival when the world is in such an unstable state? Pure idiocy!  
  
   
**???:**  
Endure with patience, and keep love within your heart! Follow in my footsteps!  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
...But everyone was looking forward to Halloween...  
My children, too...  
  
   
**???:**  
Blasphemy! Backtalk is punishable by death! But, for the sake of your children, I shall give you a day off. With remuneration!  
  
   
**???:**  
Lay down your sword and return to your pitiful family at once! That is, if you value your life!  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
Er, Your Majesty?  
I, uh, I don't quite follow...  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Just go home.  
It means you have tomorrow off.  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
...Understood. Then with all due respect, I shall receive your punishment of...paid leave.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Now then, my queen.  
What would you have us do?  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Shall we take them on now so we don't have to worry about them later?  
  
   
**???:**  
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!  
You fool!  
  
   
**???:**  
If we did that, it'd be like I was afraid of them for some reason!  
  
   
**???:**  
I'm sending the knights into town.  
It'll prevent the citizens from becoming restless.  
  
   
**???:**  
As for you two... Well, there's no need for you to be deployed.  
  
   
**???:**  
I know you're planning on hitting on the local girls the second I send you there. Sorry, but things don't always go your way!  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
...No, that's not what I...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Unbelievable... She sees through our very way of life...  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
No, Lord Tristan. I really just care about the safety of the town.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...I hear there's a girl with a broken heart at one of the taverns. Apparently her man left her after losing his entire fortune on a bet the other day.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Which tavern is that? You mean that cute girl from Ash Tree Tavern on 3rd?  
  
   
**???:**  
Ohoho. Maybe you would like to wait in prison instead of your own rooms?  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Excuse us. We will remain on standby, Your Majesty.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Then we shall take our leave.  
Please get some rest, my queen.  
  
   
**???:**  
I will, of course.  
Now leave immediately!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Yes, Your Majesty.  
...Tristan?  
  
   
**???:**  
...?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
... (Snoring)  
  
   
**???:**  
...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...How sad. This intense pain is making me sad.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
You know, in a way, that was quite impressive...  
  
   
## Section 3: "May King"  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
First things first.  
We should get more people!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Are we not enough on our own...?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
No, that's not it! Mash, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet], I'm always depending on you!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
But we're up against famous knights.  
Just the three of us isn't enough!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Also, I'm a fantasy hero. They always have a wide variety of party members to support them!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
When I was an idol, I had someone on drums and taiko, woodwind, and more, all to back me up!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's a lot of percussion.  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Yes, we played to the primal beats!  
You could really feel it!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We need more cowbell...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I know... But I think there's an even more pressing issue at hand...  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Umm... So you'd like a Caster as well?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Yep, yep! And a cleric type would be good too.  
One who can use their cure magic for healing!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Healing, huh...  
  
   
**Nurse:**   
...Now then, let's begin the treatment.  
  
   
**Nurse:**   
This is to save you. You will have to endure one or two broken bones, and maybe the loss of an arm or two.  
Or three.  
  
   
**Nurse:**   
Okay, here I go!  
  
   
**Monk:**   
Hm? Healing? You don't need that yet. We can self-heal through adrenaline and endorphins alone!  
  
   
**Monk:**   
Come now, don't cry. Pull yourself together.  
You're a hero, right!?  
  
   
**Serial Killer:**   
Hmm... I don't really know what I'm doing, so I'm going to take you apart. I'll do my best!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Let's handle the healing ourselves!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good idea!  
   
**Mash:**   
Finding the right person for the job is harder than I thought... Is there anyone else who can heal?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is there no one else who could do it?  
   
**Mash:**   
Others who could... Perhaps Sanson?  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
There, I healed you.  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
To think that I would be healing people, when I used to execute people. Hehe, how ironic...  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
Yes, I have sinned...  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
Oh, Marie... Marie... Will I ever be able to forgive myself?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He'd be too burdened with guilt to even do his job...  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's no use. Nobody comes to mind.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
How about we head back to the tavern and ask there?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Uh, I'm not sure about the tavern...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I suppose you're right.  
In that case, Doctor...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
... (Yawn)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hey!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yikes! Talk about an ominous voice!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I had a rare occasion to relax, and I couldn't resist...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Don't worry, I've confirmed your location.  
What's going on?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We want to find a Servant that can join us, so we'd like you to widen the search range as much as possible.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay, roger that.  
...It's weak, but there's a signature near you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What!? Near us!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, be careful!  
Someone might be here to ambush us!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? What? Is someone here?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Show yourself!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...It's quiet. Doctor, are you sure...?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Of course I am! I'm doing my job! I really am!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But if it's that close and you can't tell, then that means&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
An Assassin, I imagine.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They haven't moved at all, so I'm guessing they don't mean you any harm.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Aaaaaahhh!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, that scream...!  
  
   
**G：Elisabeth:**   
Who set this trap here!?  
M-My leg's stuck and I can't move...!  
  
   
**G：Elisabeth:**   
Something weird's coming!  
I can't move! Save me, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go save her!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Elisabeth!  
  
   
**G：Elisabeth:**   
[♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]! My leg! It's stuck! I can't move!  
  
   
**G：Elisabeth:**   
Save meeeee!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's okay! We're coming! Master, give me your orders!  
  
   
**G：Elisabeth:**   
Save me before you do that!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry, in a second!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
The battle is over.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good work. I'm not seeing any more enemies in the surrounding area.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Except for the KO'd demi-dragon in front of you, I mean.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Okay, Doctor.  
So...  
  
   
**F：Elisabeth:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The constant flailing must've made all her blood rush to her head and knocked her out. I suppose we should get her down.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That was mean! You just left me there!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sorry, we had to prioritize the situation...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
In any event, there isn't anyone here!  
I'll turn you into a pincushion for lying to me!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's strange. Looks like they just won't come out.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's almost like they're saying, “I want nothing to do with this zero who's mistaken herself for a hero! I'm going to stay in my room!”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We'll just have to bring them out somehow...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh...  
   
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, you look like you just saw the world ending or something!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Your spiritual essence is also wavering!  
Are you okay, Fujimaru!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Wh-What's wrong, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]?  
You don't look so well.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Do you want to hear a song?  
Will you feel better if you hear me sing?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Elisabeth, that's&mdash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I...just might.  
   
  
   
**Both:**   
WH...  
  
   
**Both:**   
WHAT DID YOU SAY!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That... That can't be! Fujimaru, this is all my fault!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You must've been carrying around a heavy mental burden all this time!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'll Rayshift you back, and we can try this Singularity again later...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, pull yourself together!  
Um, well... You can do it! You can do it!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou, fou!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
[♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]... You've finally become captivated by my songs...!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Very well. This will double as my daily voice training.  
I'll sing my heart out for you!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Consider yourself lucky.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You're going to be the first ones who get to hear my songs after becoming a hero.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I wonder if a flock of wyverns will randomly come to attack!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If not, Roman soldiers will suffice.  
Honestly, anything's fine... Whoops! Guess not!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's...too late...!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
   
Hold it riiiight there!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank goodness...!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? Uh... It's the green... You know...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Robin Hood!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Yeah, that's it!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
D-Dammit! I accidentally released my No Face May King!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Fujimaru... You're reckless.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? Huh? Wait, what's going on?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master risked it all to bring the hidden Servant out...!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...I don't really get it, but this is all thanks to my song, right?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'm just glad I was able to help [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet].  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
If it's going to weigh on your conscience later, then don't bother doing it at all...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Oh!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Elisabeth?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I get it! That trap that got me a moment ago!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That was your doing, wasn't it!?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
What a pain. You have surprisingly good intuition.  
Yeah, yeah, sorry about that.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
The outskirts of town have been dangerous lately.  
Pests and werebeasts have been lurking about.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Probably because it's almost Halloween.  
The monsters are getting all excited, too.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
As a guy who roosts around these parts, I can't sleep at night without setting up some traps. I get all anxious.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Are you sure that's the werebeasts' fault? Is it not just that you need traps around to feel at ease?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
The latter, of course. A free safe haven doesn't feel right. Safety is maintained through hard work and money.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're pretty cautious.  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yep, I'm a cautious guy.  
Only the humble survive in the forest.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I'm naturally a coward. I'm scared to see my enemy's face straight on.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Is that why you take them down from the shadows?  
You're actually an Assassin, aren't you?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Werebeasts...  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yeah, beasts typically don't go near human territory. They're careful, after all.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
But they've gotten so close.  
We're in a perilous situation here.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
It does seem that it is unusually dangerous here.  
I bet that pyramid is the main culprit.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's right, Mash! Nicely done!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That pyramid is the cause of everything!  
I'm sure something can be done if we travel there!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
You think so?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
To be honest, the werebeasts started showing up way before the pyramid&mdash;  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hey, looks like someone else got caught in the trap.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
If you're going to take on the pyramid, I don't mind lending a hand. That queen's brazen attitude is just too much for me.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I was just thinking that she could use a little punishment.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you very much!  
Elisabeth, we got ourselves a scout!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Scout? You mean someone who looks for potential idols!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...But I don't feel like joining an agency yet...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What should I do...?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Considering you're a ruler, I really think you should stop daydreaming like that, you know?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Sh-Shut up. Anyway, let's take out those werebeasts!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
[♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet], Mash, Robin... Follow me!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I can't have dirty werebeasts attacking my town!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Robin, what's wrong?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Oh, nothing. Just thinking about how the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, so to speak...  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That dragon girl has no other plan but to rush in.  
We'll just have to support her, won't we?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
There you are! Hahaha. Something really did get caught!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You look stupid hanging upside down like that!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Elisabeth! You should think about what happened to you a few minutes ago!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I decided to stay positive, and keep anything that happened in the past locked away in my heart!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Well how about you examine some of those things tucked away in your heart, huh?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Yeah, I couldn't forget them even if I wanted to!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Anyway, Green! You're joining us once we take them out!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Sure. Once we get rid of all of them, there's no reason for me to stay in this forest anyway.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
This is totally going to be a pain, but I guess I have to.  
I'll join you on your Death Tour!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It's not a “Death Tour”!  
It's a curing, shiny concert tour!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Alright, the scout will now scout for us!  
You're going to keep your promise, right?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Fine. So what do we do? Barge into the pyramid now?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
No, I want one more person, I think.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A four-person party is pretty standard.  
   
**Mash:**   
I-Is it? I thought it was six...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Anyway, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet], I want a mage!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A mage!  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's right, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!  
  
   
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Huh. You're going to go scout a mage, huh...  
Well, that's fine.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I do know someone, but... um...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is there a problem?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Is it because they have gone insane, or that they build miniature gardens, or that they're fighting between AC and DC, or that they summon a flying saucer...?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...Well, those would be problems, yeah...  
It's just, she's a lot like someone we know.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A lot like who?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
(Points silently)  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Me?  
  
   
**???:**  
(Gasp!)  
I just had a feeling of impending disaster!  
  
   
**???:**  
But he who runs in the face of the enemy does not deserve the mantle of “pharaoh.”  
  
   
**???:**  
No matter what disaster it may be, I shall humbly fight it off!  
  
   
## Section 4: "PHAAARAAAOHHH"  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Hey, are we there yet?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Sure, just wait a little longer.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Robin, Robin.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um... Who is this mage you're talking about, and how is she like Elisabeth?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
They're practically one and the same.  
She's just a bit more intelligent.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
She's a bright one, but she's narrow-minded. Arrogant. Bossy. Fairly serious, but with a low boiling point.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
She jumps to conclusions and goes out of control, leading to disastrous consequences. It's all very painful to watch.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What? That's not like me at all.  
  
   
**Both:**   
It's just like you.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
(Gulp)  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
She's a pharaoh, and a queen, as well as a self-proclaimed god of the sky and the underworld.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What? Don't you think that's too much description?  
Only idols of little talent have that many traits.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Noblewoman, vampire, serial killer, bat wings, dragon horns, idol, dragon girl. Isn't that too much too?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Wait, how come all my traits sound negative!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hey, hold it. I'm detecting a powerful response...  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Who's intruding in my territory this late without an appointment? Begone, impudent ones!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
S-So sudden!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Waaaaah!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Calm down! It's an illusion.  
An illusion!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hey there, Your Majesty.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
May King, you must be mad to bring them here.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
We made a pact to protect one another's territory.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Firstly, stop calling me that. It's embarrassing.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
And secondly, what's your deal? Bringing out a scary illusion to intimidate us and whatnot?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Well, what did you expect?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
I don't know about you and the shield girl, but that woman there has a nasty aura.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Eh? Me?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Indeed. Tell me your name, impudent one.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
You're... I don't know...um, like... The fact that I feel a subtle kinship with you is ticking me off!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
This may sound sudden, but I hereby declare you my eternal rival! Got it!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Fine by me!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
For some reason, when I'm talking to you, my head starts to hurt and it's ticking me off!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
I see. So it looks like our opinions align.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Right. That's good.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...  
  
   
**Both:**   
TELL ME YOUR NAME!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
When these two start talking, I get the feeling it will never end, Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Introduce yourselves! Both of you!  
   
**C：???:**  
Huh? Oh, r-right.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
My name is !  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? Name?  
Oh, right. Name. Yes, name.  
  
   
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
My name is Nitocris.  
I am a pharaoh from a distant land.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
The god of the underworld, and the incarnation of the sky god Horus.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
And now, I study magecraft while I frolic with my phantoms in a deep cave.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
My name is Elisabeth Báthory.  
As you can see, I'm an idol.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
My specialty is idol pop, I suppose. An since I have draconic blood, naturally I also have a breath attack!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
And I'm also a distinguished noble. And these wings and horns? Cute, aren't they? Anything else?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I see. Now we understand each other well.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's right. I think so too.  
  
   
**Both:**   
   
We'll never get along!!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
No, I think you two are getting along just fine.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
How!? She's a typical spoiled Western noble girl!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
She's the type of woman I hate the most in this world! She needs to suffer more!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Th-That's my line! I hate that “Oh, look at me, I'm a queen” attitude! It makes me want to throw up! Especially since you're an old hag!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Master, is she talking about Carmilla?)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Probably...  
   
**Mash:**   
(It's very sad, isn't it...?)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They're denying each other, so yeah...  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
She's lived a complicated life, too, huh?  
  
   
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I can't take this anymore! It's time to duel!  
I'll smash your face in with my holy sword!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Fine! I'll teach you and your 80s style who's really the boss!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
That armor is just old! I can't say exactly what's old about it, but it's very old!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What? You don't even know that retro style is the new trend!? What a dummy!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
The only thing retro we need around here is Egypt!  
You moron!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
   
RAAARRGGH!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
   
HISSSSSS!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, I don't understand what's going on.  
Fou's cries are easier to follow!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What are you doing? Let's go, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]! Crimson Hero Elisabeth is going to take down the evil mage!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Follow meeeeee!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hey! Please don't take Master away!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Argh! Damn it! We've got no choice but to follow them!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
First, let's have you fight my pretty, pretty phantoms!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Bring it on! Come on, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I got it, so let go of my hand!  
   
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
We're through! Let's keep going!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
My throat's all warmed up now!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Tch, I can hear those evil sound waves all the way here.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
It's like the wails of the dead from the underworld! Honestly, it's a genre I like!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Idol pop... I guess I can't take it lightly!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What do you mean by wails of the dead!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
The motto of idol pop is “Cute, Cuter, Cutest,” you know!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
But I'm not done yet!  
...Sphinx! Come on out!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What!?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Heheh. It costs a lot to rent, but this sphinx is the true guardian of my cavern.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Pharaoh Ozymandias may not look it, but he runs a very honest business...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
“Oh, you want to borrow my army of holy beasts?  
Then the rental fee is three scarabs a week.”  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
“If you want a Marika Sphinx, add in 10 chains. Also, make sure its stomach is full when you bring it back.”  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
He gave me those very reasonable terms!  
Now, get them!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Tch! Even I can tell... That thing is really powerful!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
But don't worry, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet].  
I will win. You know why?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not a clue...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Heheh, so even my little [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] doesn't know?  
Then I'll tell you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Because you're strong?  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Close. But might doesn't always make right.  
  
   
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It's because I'm a hero. In other words, the good guy always wins!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Now do you get it, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...That's strange. My pharaoh-vision shows your original alignment as Chaotic-Evil...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Sh-Sh-Shut up! Bring it, you hag!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...That was surprisingly easy!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Th-That's strange! There's no way my guardian sphinx is this weak!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe it's not in its natural habitat?  
   
**Nitocris:**   
That's it! How foolish! I should've brought a heater!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It seemed tired.  
   
**Nitocris:**   
(GASP!) It must have been tired from its long journey from Egypt...!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
And it probably couldn't adapt to the environment either! How foolish of me!  
  
   
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Now we finally meet!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
So you made it through all my challenges, and now here you are at last.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I shall praise you for that!  
But this is the end of the line!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Why? Because I'm splendidly strong! I've been cooped up in my room perfecting my magecraft!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Unbelievable. She's bragging about being a shut-in!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Wait, are you okay?  
I really hate dark and cramped places.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Me too! But this is the underworld right now! If I want to enhance my dark pharaoh power, this is the only place!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
To be honest, the Western underworld is just too damaging.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
The Egyptian underworld is vast, comfortable, and dry... Why do you people view death as a negative thing?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Rather, why do you have to punish souls who have already lost their bodies? Does your god actually hate humans?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Listen to you. You're pretty cynical. You look pretty sporty, but you're actually just another bookworm.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Book...worm? No, I study curses, see...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I wrote messages as a pharaoh, but most of what I wrote were spells and curses...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
So you're a bass player!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
The person that works hard to set the tone of the band from behind the scenes and carve an oppressive sound into the audience!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
But the sound is usually hidden under the melody of the guitar. The guitar plays the melody, the bass lays down the rhythm...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh, it's so sad! The bassist is lonely,  
but their job is the most rock n' roll of them all!  
That's what I think!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You must've endured a lot, despite your demeanor!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I don't really know what you mean by bassist, but I appreciate your noticing that!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
And I can see you struggle a lot, too! Just look at how hard the people around you struggle!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Yes, of course!  
Wait... Was that a compliment?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Right!? Zebra stripes says some good things, despite being our enemy!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's Nitocris for you... She's just a little off...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. She has the insight to understand a situation in a single moment, but her conclusions always seem to miss the mark...  
  
   
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I accept it. That woman is a tough foe! That's why I won't use any tricks. I'll fight her head-on!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Haha, bring it on.  
If it weren't for this situation, I'm sure we'd&mdash;  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Yes, I'm sure we could've been friends...!  
But that future will never happen.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
It's sad to say it, but you're right.  
Now let's fight...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you sure you guys aren't actually getting along...?  
  
   
**Both:**   
100% SURE!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Heh... Not bad... I've run out of my hardworking phantoms...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You're not so bad yourself. Those were some amazing moves... Also, those phantoms are cute.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Especially the ones with the sheets on their heads.  
The ones that go in circles.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I feel like they could give me some useful ideas for my concert!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
So you noticed my Medjeds... I guess you're not just a harmful beast after all.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Your songs really were wonderful...  
The phantoms were all applauding...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
And so was I... It felt so good that I was inspired spiritually.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Huh?  
   
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
It's true that the pyramid has been in the back of my mind. As pharaoh, I figured I needed to “say hello”...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
But I didn't think it was right to take them on alone, so I stayed here in my little abode.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...Very well, Crimson Hero Elisabeth.  
I will help you with your concert.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Thank you. I have a feeling we will become good friends.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Panting) We've finally caught up... Huh?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
A-A handshake?  
Not a fight?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um... Master?  
What happened?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I knew they'd be friends.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...But if two troublemakers become friends, that just means an exponential increase in problems for us...  
  
   
**Both:**   
WHAT DID YOU SAY!?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Anyway, let's get going!  
Our goal is to reach Pyramid Csejte!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Our next stop takes us through the Glacier Zone!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Glaciers!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Now that I think about it, yes, it's weird to have something like that on the way to a castle...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I think it's a staple for these type of adventures.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Hm? I'm seeing one, two, three, four... five Servant responses...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There's one too many of you!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
...Humph. There's an un-candy lack of candy around here... And no, that wasn't meant to be a joke.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
What's going on, Fujimaru?  
You didn't lie to me, did you!?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I thought Halloween was supposed to be this wonderful festival where you can eat all the candy you want!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What are you doing here?  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Idiot! I've been here the whole time!  
You just failed to notice me!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How long have you been here?  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Fwahahaha! I Rayshifted here with you!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
So I wasn't seeing things...!  
Thank goodness!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? Who are you?  
I don't want a Jester joining my party!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Who are you calling a Jester!?  
I'm not some drunk Kyoto commoner!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like the next episode will still be chaotic!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
...Humph.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Hahahaha! What a boring book this is!  
Though it is killing time, I guess...  
  
   
**F：???:**  
You there! The sleeping pig!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Yes ma'am. Sleeping pig Tristan, at your service.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
I don't like that music. Play something else.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Then what about this?  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Stop it, you're driving me crazy!  
I can't read my book in peace!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I thought a more upbeat tune would be better...  
  
   
**F：???:**  
There are limits to how far you can go! Limits!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
And night has fallen. Loud noises are unrefined.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
And actually, how did you play that sound with a harp?  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Excuse me, my queen.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
What do you want? I'm going to bed. If you have something to report, tell me tomorrow&mdash;  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Pharaoh-You-Know-Who has joined the party from Chaldea.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
WH...  
  
   
**F：???:**  
   
WHAT DID YOU SAY!?  
  
   
**F：???:**  
The pharaoh aligned herself with that stupid, foolish girl who lacks even a shred of intelligence!?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
How sad! Our queen's face is twisted in sorrow...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...but even then it is still radiantly beautiful...  
  
   
**F：???:**  
With her involved, they will even break through the Lava Zone, not to mention the Glacier Zone...  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
What shall we do, my queen?  
  
   
**F：???:**  
It seems an idiot can exceed one's expectations.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
This is difficult... Humph...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
The worried look on Your Majesty's face is beautiful too&mdash;  
  
   
**F：???:**  
I'm trying to think, and there you are getting in the way. Go jump out a window.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Oh... I can fly...!  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
He really jumped...!  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
He's using sound waves to fly...  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Of course he can fly! Haven't you heard of the Tristan thrush? Anyway, Sir Lances-A-Lot-Of-Married-Women...  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Yes, Your Majesty...  
I mean, what!?  
  
   
**F：???:**  
I'm deploying those girls to the Lava Zone.  
Hold them back no matter the cost.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
Wh-What...? But those girls are far too dangerous.  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
They might get out of control.  
No, I mean they will! I'm sure of it!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Hahahaha! It'll be fine! Why?  
Because it's me doing it!  
  
   
**Lancelot:**   
(That worries me...)  
  
   
## Section 5: "It's Frozen, So Let It Go"  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
There's no need to introduce myself!  
That's right, it's me, Ibaraki!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You were in the corner hiding.  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
If you noticed me there, you should've said something! Or are you teasing me!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I didn't notice you.  
   
**Mash:**   
Sorry. I thought you were some child trying to stalk us for some sweets!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
   
Y-You...  
Y-Y-You...!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
You thought I would hang around just for some sweets!? They were good, yes, but still...!  
  
   
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Argh! You're all a bunch of imbeciles!  
Don't you know who I am!?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I'm the leader of the oni, as well as a skilled thief notorious in the capital!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I am Ibaraki-Douji, a thief so great that I was able to build the great Ibuki Shuten Palace on Mt. Ooe!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A thief... Right, I suppose that's accurate... There are records of you stealing treasures from the nobility...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Hahahaha, that's right!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
“Princess Kaguya” is such a joke! If I had been around in that period, those five treasures would've easily been mine!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
So, do you fear me now!? Do you respect me!?  
Will you praise me!? Will you give me some sweets!?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I am an evil monster, an oni...  
Ah-choo!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Sniff... It's cold... I hate being cold...  
Mother always told me to wear a belly warmer...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
...Um, wait.  
Uh, where was I in my story?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think we've heard enough.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Enough, eh? I see, I see. Then you're quick to understand. That's not a bad thing.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
But Mash. You look as cold as me. Aren't you uncomfortable? Do you not have a belly warmer?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, I'm fine...  
But it's true that the temperature is low in this area.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, as long as you're in your Chaldea uniform, you should be fine. It's resistant to both the cold and the heat.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What about you, Elisabeth? Um, since you're exposing yourself more than usual...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...I'm cold...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, I mean, your outfit...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I-I'm a hero, so it shouldn't be a problem!  
Heroes don't catch colds!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't think she's okay...  
Let's get through here as quick as we can.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Y-Yes, good idea...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
From a pharaoh point of view, I think it's best we just run right through.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
My garments don't cover much either!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Got it. Then let's go for a little run!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Waaah, it's cold!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
My lovely phantoms normally cool me down, but in this weather, they're kind of annoying!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yeah... Even I'm cold. And I'm one of the more properly dressed ones.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
By the way, Ibaraki!  
Why did you come here!?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
(Talking with mouth full of something)  
Oh, no special reason. I just felt like it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh. You just felt like it...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And it's not for extremely selfish reasons, correct?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Trick?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Treat?  
   
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I don't understand. Is that a password?  
But that tart thing was delicious.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
And this “candy” stuff is exceptional as well!  
But it's so sweet, I'm afraid my fangs will melt!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
...Sheesh. Back in the day, a single piece of konpeitou was enough to make me swing between joy and sorrow...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I wish Mother were here, because then I could give her some... But anyway, mmm, I'm very curious about those pound cake things too...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You've developed quite the sweet tooth...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No wonder Shuten treats you like a child...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
What are you talking about?  
This is not my intention!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Humans are the ones who offer me sweets to save their lives!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Meat is a better choice than sweets when you get hungry. Then again, after becoming a Servant, I am never hungry!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
So I'll let them live in exchange for this unsubstantial offering of sweets, but just this once. Welp, I feel like I'm going to melt!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see. Intentions aside, your true feelings are totally showing.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
But once you step out of town, what the heck is going on!? Treat! Treat! Treeeaaat!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I keep yelling the password, but no one shows up!  
Ah! Oh no! I'm getting sugar withdrawal symptoms...!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I need something to munch on! Something sugary! Something tough!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
But if you don't have anything like that, one of those Evil Bones you always have stocked up will do!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh hell no! Anything but an Evil Bone!  
   
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Then candy! Marshmallows would be fine, too!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Come to think of it, running around in the cold is making me crave something with calories in it!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What about Mash!?  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai!?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Mmm, she looks soft but not sweet!  
Rejected!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't have any more!  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hahaha. That's because we used a lot on Caster Elisabeth.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
What...did you just say!?  
  
   
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
   
So... no more sweets? All gone?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
But I still haven't had my favorite&ndash;this thing you call “chocolate”!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's the way the cookie crumbles...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Grrr, grrr, hahahaha!  
...I'm going home...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I'm going back to the mountain!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
P-Please, wait, Ibaraki! I'll give you sweets when we get back to Chaldea!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Our meeting up here must be fate.  
Please, won't you help us?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Bwahahaha!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Nonsense. A human seeking help from an oni is the height of absurdity!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're right, but...  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
... (Rustle, rustle)  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
In the first place, I only came here for fun. I am what you could call a visitor from out of town, and yet you ask for my help to&ndash;Mmmpph!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hmm?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
   
Ohhh... Ooooooohhh!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Whoops, silly me, throwing chocolate around like that!  
I was saving that for the kids in town...  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Although I suppose this works in a Japanese sense. Don't people there yell “Oni out, luck in!” while throwing food?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
   
This is... choco... chocolate...!  
It's sweet as hell... and sweet as hell to boot!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This oni here isn't good at expressing herself.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
But it won't work. Just a measly piece of chocolate won't work on me at all! It won't work...!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
She's gritting her teeth through a torrent of tears...  
Her lament is making me choke up...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Yaaa! What's wrong, good man in green!? Aren't you going to attack me more!? Come on, come on!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Like the time at Rashomon!  
Just like at Rashomon!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Well, I wish I could give you more, but...  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Uh-oh, something's coming.  
This is no time to be throwing chocolate around.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
   
Hahahahaha, this infuriates me even more! Scum!  
Get out of here. I'll rip you from limb to limb!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
M-Moving to battle formation!  
Whenever you're ready, Master!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Green man! Green good tidings, green pilgrim, green hermit, green geezer!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
As you can see, the pests are gone! So come on!  
Pretend it's Setsubun and throw me some sweets!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
All right, all right. I suppose you deserve it. But call me a geezer again and you can kiss chocolate goodbye.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Mmm. Understood. I'm clever in that area.  
But... Mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
We got rid of those enemies as quickly as the chocolates melting in my mouth.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Even this delicious chocolate isn't enough to keep me here. This place isn't worthy anymore! You heard me!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Farewell! Farewell!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Oh really? I was going to say... If you can defeat the queen living in that pyramid, you'll have all the sweets you can eat. Too bad.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I knew that pyramid was trouble.  
When do we leave?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ibaraki...  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm. She's an unexpected addition to our party, but Ibaraki-Douji's strength is the real deal. Besides...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Besides what, Doctor?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I think it's a good thing she's showing an interest in human culture.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even if her underlying aggression towards humans can't be changed, having a favorite food in common with us is a positive thing.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, certainly. I think that leads to mutual understanding.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. So, Fujimaru, I know it'll be tough, but please look after her.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sure, I'll do my best!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She's perfectly tame now.  
   
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
So where do we go from here?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Next is... the Lava Zone!  
...But why is there lava...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
L-Let's just go. We won't know until we see it for ourselves...!  
  
   
**All:**   
   
IT'S SO HOT!  
  
   
## Section 6: "Mother's Love and Lover's Passion Are as Barren as a Lava Plain"  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It's hot!  
So hooooooot!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Yow! Magma!  
Magma splashed on me! Hot!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-Are you okay!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
   
Maaaaash!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Behind my shield!?  
U-Understood!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You too, Master! It's dangerous here, so please hide behind my shield!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
S-Sorry, but me too, please!  
With my thighs exposed like this...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
W-We're like sardines in a can!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Robin, you too! Over here!  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Thanks for the offer. Your consideration is all I need.  
I've got this hood to protect me, so I'll make it through.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
When you're on an adventurous journey, countermeasures against heat are a must. Though I have to say lava was unexpected.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Baki, you too! Over here!  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Hahaha, unnecessary! It'll take more than this kind of heat to injure an oni's skin!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I'm fine here. Use the space to protect your weak bodies instead.  
  
   
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Argh, this... Move over a little, Nitocris!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
No way! If my body pokes out any more, my thigh will... My thigh will...!  
  
   
**Both:**   
   
It's so hoooooooot!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
This is bad. Hey, we've got some enemies.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Enemies? There are enemies here...?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What's that queen thinking!? Here! In the Lava Zone! Why!? Why would she put enemies here!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
This is the only path that leads to the pyramid!  
Why is there lava here anyway!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Do they use this path themselves to get to town!?  
Are they stupid? Are they morons!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...It seems the excessive stress has... temporarily enhanced her intelligence...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I understand your frustration, but now's not the time! Get ready to fight!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'll kill whoever thought of this map!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
(Panting) I-I did it... I sure did it...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
N-Now then, let's keep moving!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What's wrong, Master?  
You're not looking too well...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Not too well? More like you look ghastly.  
Though honestly, it's my type of color.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
You may be ill. Maybe your body's out of whack coming from the freezing cold into the scorching heat.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No... I'm getting chills for no reason...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru!? Your brain waves are getting highly unstable!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Is there something abnormal in the area? Maybe there's a statue or book that affects your mental state with just a glance!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is the Lava Zone!  
Nothing like that can be found here!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It's okay, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]. With the five of us, it won't matter who we're facing.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Mash is the drum-defense, Nitocris the bass-support. Green is a manager-backup, while Ibaraki and I will be the leads.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I agree... I think it's a good, well-balanced team.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's the spirit!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There seem to be some Servants waiting, but I'm sure it will be okay with this party.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
C'mon, we're almost at the end of this Lava Zone! There's nothing left to fear!  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
...Oh my.  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
...    
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm going home!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-That's...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The three Servants who Fujimaru keeps calling a “danger beyond all dangers”!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Also known as the Always-Sneaking-Into-Master's-Bed Trio!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Nah, let's face it. They're monsters.  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Oh? Oh my, my, my?  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Everyone, did you hear that child's voice just now?  
  
   
**All:**   
!!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Oh crap, Minamoto-no-Raikou!?  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
Indeed I did. I think I just heard “I love you!”  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes, I'm sure that was towards me.  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
... (Giggle)  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Hee hee.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
(...G-Got my No Face May King out in the nick of time...)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Master...! S-Senpai, are you okay? Deep breaths, deep breaths. We're fine. They haven't found us.)  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
(Hey, why do we need to hide?  
We have to defeat them to get through, right?)  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
(Shh! Just keep silent, Elisabeth. I can spiritually feel it.)  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
(You may be the root of all negative energy for mankind, but those three are the root of all negative energy for the entire universe...)  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
(In other words, they are like black holes...!)  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
(That is correct... You've got a pretty sharp eye there... Minamoto-no-Raikou is especially bad. That woman doesn't have a hitbox!)  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hmm... How odd.  
I can smell Fujimaru after all.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
(Smell? What's up with that Servant...!?)  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
(Sniff, sniff) Yooooo-hooooo!  
Fujimaru, are you heeeeeere?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Eeeeek!  
   
**Mash:**   
(It's okay, it's okay!  
Calm down, Master!)  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
(How traumatized are you...!?)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Trembling)  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
(You there, are you all right?  
You've started shaking like jelly...)  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
(This may take a while, but let's keep still...  
They'll eventually leave...)  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
(But we're still in the Lava Zone, so it's unbearably hot!)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Would you rather fight those three!?)  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
(...Well... that's...)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Right?)  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hmmm... Around here somewhere...  
Fujimaru, where aaaaare yoooouuu?  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Playing hide-and-seek, are you?  
Do you two know a surefire way to win?  
  
   
**Both:**   
?  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
“Vengeful Lightning of the Ox-King”!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(What the...!?)  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
You just go and incinerate places that look like good hiding spots.  
  
   
**Both:**   
I seeee.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
(...Why on earth are you contracted to someone like that?)  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
(...Fujimaru, this may sound obtrusive, but now may be the time to make up your mind.)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Master...)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's fight...!  
   
**Mash:**   
(Y-Yes! Understood, Master!)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's do our best...!  
   
**Nitocris:**   
(I can tell you are mustering up all the courage you have... Now that's what I call an ally!)  
  
   
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Oh.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Ah!  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
...Found you...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Sorry, but we need to get past.  
And no, we're not letting you have [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
We will let you through if you just hand over the child though...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...! I said no!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I saw her hesitate...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Elly!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It's okay, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]! Don't worry!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
...Hey, you foreigner.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Um, me?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Mm-hmm. There's something I want you to do with your skills...  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Then we have no choice. Let us squash the gypsy moth and take back our beloved child.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Gypsy moth? Who are you talking about?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Probably you...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hmm, I see.  
...Did you just call me a moth!?  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Yes, a moth. See, you have antennae.  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Plus you're an eyesore.  
All those unnecessarily bright colors.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hehehehe.  
Hahahaha.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
All right, you're dead. I was never afraid of thunder to begin with. Don't you underestimate the thunder of János Hill!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hehehehe. I'm usually a very lenient person, but...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
But with this “Elly” individual I feel... some sort of destined rivalry.  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
...Um, I would be happy if I could just sneak into Master's bed...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's a no! Rejected!  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
(Sob)  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Don't worry, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Crimson Hero Elisabeth shall protect you from this sinister, good-for-nothing trio!  
  
   
**All Three:**   
...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
...Is she a genius at rubbing people the wrong way?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
She is an innate airhead...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Now, bring it on!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Urgh...!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hey, whoa! Why are they so persistent!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
They come back no matter how many times we defeat them!  
They're like zombies... It's scary!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Who are you calling a zombie? Only one thing keeps this body moving, and that's love!  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
There's nothing stronger than a mother's love.  
Nothing in this whole world!  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
...As I said before, I only want Master to touch me a little.  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
Like, my head or cheek...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We can't keep this up...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Alright, now!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Go, Sogen-bi! “Great Grudge of Rashomon”!  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
Eek!  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Cursed pest...!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Flailing about is useless!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
To the three of us who are used to being around lava, your attack was like a gust of refreshing wind!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Wait, h-huh?  
Master...? Where did Master go?  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
There, over there.  
...Oh no, don't go that way!  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
That's hot lava! Wait right there, Mother is coming to save you!  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Hyah!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh! I shall not fall behind!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Please wait for me, Master!  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
Huh? Oh, um...  
  
   
**Serenity:**   
Then me too&mdash;  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Okay, now's our chance!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ibaraki-Douji, what did you do?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Ah, I asked Nitocris to make a Master decoy doll using her magecraft.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I had the mummies make it while we fought, but I didn't think it would work...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
They do say love is blind.  
Heh heh! I can't believe Raikou actually fell for it!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Keheh, foolish fools!  
They'll fall into the hot lava and&mdash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Think again! All three of them are alive and swimming merrily through it! Let's run while we can!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
No way!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Run for your life!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes! Everyone, let's hurry!!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
They're not even oni! How can they jump into boiling lava and still survive!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's probably the power of love!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Love? Love is scary!  
  
   
## Section 7: "One More Chance"  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
We've finally made it here...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Come on, everyone, let's take out that witch in her pyramid!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah!  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Good answer, my little [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'll do our best.  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's what the nobility say when they don't actually want to do something!  
  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm seeing something ahead that looks like a Servant, so be careful.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'm not scared, no matter who it is!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
The journey of the Heroic Idol Elly won't end until I defeat that queen!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Now everybody, charge!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
You've got fighting spirit, but not much else... I'm tired.  
I can't go full power all day like Shuten.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Green man, give me some caloric fuel.  
I want another chocolate.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Right, right. Take that, oni.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Fwahaha! Your pitiful attacks cannot harm me!  
I am invincible! (Chomp chomp)  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Anyway, I'm feeling dirty from all this running around.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Fujimaru, you're a Master, can't you conjure up a bathing area or two with your magecraft?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't think that's possible...  
Oh, I do have towels, though.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Alright, I'll take one.  
...Hmm. It's a little rough to the touch.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Hand me an Egyptian silk one instead.  
What? You don't have any?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Very well. Prepare one in the castle as soon as this battle is over.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Of course, a place to bathe as well.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
   
YOU GUYS AREN'T TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY AT ALL!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Come on, guys! Can't you get a little more excited?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Come on, shout in unison with me, the hero!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Sure. After we win.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
   
ARGH! Fine! Forget it!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Come on, who's our next opponent!?  
Someone else from the Round Table? Bring it!  
  
   
**???:**  
...Oh?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
U-Uncle...!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? Uncle... Vlad III!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? But he seems a little different than the person I know...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Of course I am.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
A Servant is summoned by extracting a single aspect of a hero.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I am not here as King Vlad III.  
I am here as the warrior who punishes all evil.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Um, Uncle Vlad? ...Why are you glaring at me...  
Is something the matter?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Elisabeth Báthory!  
I have come to judge you for your sins!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
H-Huh!? You have!?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Save your breath!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Your existence is sinful... And now you shall be punished for your immorality and wickedness!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Jeez... Count Vlad normally only gets mad when people call him a vampire, but look at him now!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Oh, never mind. This is the warrior Vlad&ndash;no wonder his anger threshold is so low!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A-Anyway, prepare for combat!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Elisabeth! Let's just fight for now!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Um, okay... Y-Yeah, you're right! We have to fight...!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Got him... No! We didn't!  
Master, we're continuing the battle!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
&mdash;No, we're done.  
As I thought, thou does not understand.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh...?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...Start over from the beginning once more. Otherwise, thou shall never be able to stand before that Queen.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
If thy wish to call thyself a hero and wear that armor, thy must first understand!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Understand what&mdash;Huh?  
  
   
**???:**  
...y.  
  
   
**???:**  
...ry.  
  
   
**???:**  
...rry.  
  
   
**???:**  
I'm sorry...  
I'm sorry this is so sudden...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um... Uh...What!?  
  
   
**???:**  
I'm really sorry, but...  
  
   
**???:**  
I regret to make you do this after all the battles you've fought, but&mdash;  
  
   
**???:**  
I want you to start over from the graveyard.  
  
   
**???:**  
&mdash;Ahem.  
  
   
**???:**  
This isn't some kind of system issue.  
There's a reason for it...  
  
   
**???:**  
Fujimaru, I want you to consider as a trial...  
  
   
**???:**  
Alright&mdash; I'm sorry, but I'm going to teleport you.  
  
   
**All:**   
   
WHY!?  
  
   
## Section 8: "New Game Plus"  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...We've come back...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ignoring the fact that there's a giant Siegfried floating in the night sky...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What could it be that Elisabeth doesn't understand?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Green man, you seem to have some idea.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Haha. Don't play dumb.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
You were the only one who had a knowing look on your face.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Oh, yeah... Probably.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What? What is it!? What don't I understand?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...Didn't you notice something about the town?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
The town...? Hmm... Oh, now that you mention it...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Nobody was preparing for Halloween.  
Everyone was locked up in their houses.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Isn't that because the queen in that pyramid banned all the festivities?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
No.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
The lack of activity was apparent long before she even came.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Let me fill you in.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
You were so busy getting excited for Halloween that you left all your administrative duties in the lurch!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Oh.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Don't “Oh” me!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
And because you were doing nothing as leader, the townspeople didn't know if it was okay to get ready for the festival or not!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Neither did your soldiers! They couldn't decide whether to go forward with the preparations or whether to stop them!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
You were the only one who was getting excited for Halloween, basically!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Ahhhh...ahh...ahhhhh!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Th-That's really bad...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...That's... So that's it...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
So you alone got so swept up in Halloween fever that you forgot to order preparations to begin?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I'm in shock. How can you be a ruler if you don't care for your people?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
A ruler must first ensure that their subordinates' bellies are full. Only then can the ruler eat. (Chomp chomp)  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
B-But I was really busy preparing for the concert...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...There's really no excuse for what you've done...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Ugh... Wh-What should I do, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]?  
Uncle Vlad was really mad!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go get another scolding.  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Waaaahh...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Elisabeth, I understand how you feel, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We need to go back towards that gate to see the queen anyway...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
But Uncle Vlad's going to get mad again...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
We can't do anything about that.  
But there's one way to apologize...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
You need to make the festival a success.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's make it the best Halloween ever.  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
The best ever...? But how?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...Well, all you have to do is tell the townspeople that Halloween's begun.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right, Elisabeth!  
Let's start Halloween properly!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Y-You're right!  
But how...?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hand out pumpkins, throw sweets, and have the little brats get their costumes ready.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
And then get rid of the wandering ghosts drawn to the festivities.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...G-Got it!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Humph. Then make the announcement.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Make the announcement. Tell everyone that the festival you promised them, the one with overflowing sweets, is set to begin.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
As a leader, you must be capable of such a proclamation. Especially given how loud you are usually.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...You're right. I can't just lip-synch along with some recording through a mic. My pride won't allow it.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Here I go!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
This is Elisabeth Báthory, the ruler of Castle Csejte!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'm sorry I'm laaaaaate!  
But I have an announcement!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Let the Halloween festivities commence!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Be careful! Elisabeth's proclamation made the dead burst from the ground!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Haha! As I expected, your words made the dead scream in terror!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
It's time for this Halloween thing to begin!  
Come, Master!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I'm seeing lots of pumpkinheads!  
Let's smash them all!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Master!  
I'll do my best!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
This time, I will do Halloween right!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
We got a lot of pumpkins...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Let's give them to the people.  
This should get Halloween off to a good start.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's right. You gotta start with a strong opening act!  
  
   
## Section 9: "Halloween Declaration"  
   
**Mash:**   
The townspeople still aren't celebrating Halloween.  
I'm not sure, but they don't seem very happy.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Then let's start by making the place Halloween central! Right, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How?  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh!? Well, um...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Once I decide something, shouldn't it just kind of happen?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
No, it shouldn't! Do you think you're some kind of spoiled princess?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
We can't do it alone. Let's ask the townspeople for help.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's all do it!  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yeah. I'm with you.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
We won't get anywhere unless we ask the townspeople.  
  
   
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...R-Right! Time to order the pigs around!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Nobody likes being called a pig. Explain to them what's going on properly. Come on, you're the ruler.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What? But my fans love it!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Even that Cock Robin chirped with joy! As its owner, that means you'd love it if I called you a pig too, right?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I've got nothing to do with that fat thing!  
It just follows me everywhere!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Elisabeth, you mustn't assume all humans are the same.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
If you want to make Halloween fun, then you must ask properly.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
F-Fine...  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Okay, let's split up and ask everyone we come across.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
We can hand out the pumpkins at the same time.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
You're right. Let's reconvene here in two hours.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Okay, see you then!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? Wait, where do I go?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Follow me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Elisabeth, come with us.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(We wouldn't want her to say things in a weird way and cause trouble...)  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Okay!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Alright, I'll sit this one out.  
I'll be waiting here! (Chomp chomp)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like we're all here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We didn't have any luck...  
Master, this is depressing...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
You too? ...Robin Hood, what about you?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
No good. Zilch.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Still, people did seem to be looking forward to the festivities.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, yes. I agree.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't think they were against Halloween per se, but they were not particularly open about any support either.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Grrr... Unforgivable! Halloween's a festival kids and adults can both enjoy, and yet...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
It seems that Elisabeth does not have enough respect as a ruler.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Add that to the fact that the queen in the pyramid banned Halloween and it's no wonder they're not on board.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...Sheesh. What kind of queen would do that to a pyramid, anyway?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hey, what is it about me that's wrong?  
  
   
**H：All:**   
The outfit (probably).  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
   
BUT I AM A HERO!  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
Halloween has been banned by&mdash;  
Oh, not you people again!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh, I know! Hey, you there!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What do you think when you look at me?  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
What do I think?  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
You should hold back on showing your skin.  
It'll hurt if you get slashed.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Zero fashion sense!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...That sound... Oh no!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Hmm? More commotion?  
Well, it has nothing to do with me.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I've got this chocolate cake that the townspeople gave me to consume instead!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Heh, heheheh... It feels like a waste to even eat it... Where should my first bite be?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Gee... It looks good no matter where you begin...  
Aww... Heheh. You adorable little thing...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I think I should take little nibbles from the side and&mdash;  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
HEY! WHAT GIVES!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're...!  
  
   
**???:**  
Oh, how sad...  
  
   
**???:**  
It saddens me that the queen does not wish to see the town stained in the orange of Halloween...  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Huh? What's with this pretty boy?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I am Tristan... Former Knight of the Round Table. Currently a Queen's Knight.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Call me Tristan the Tragic... Or perhaps Tristan Who Sighs And Looks Out Upon the Setting Sun...  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Way too long!  
  
   
**???:**  
You're an Archer. You needn't go out ahead&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Here's one more!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What the... Where's he going!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? What was that?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Wait! Where are you&mdash;  
  
   
**Mysterious Black Knight:**   
...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
New enemy approaching, for sure this time!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
What's wrong, Lanc&mdash;  
  
   
**Mysterious Black Knight:**   
SHUUUTTTTTT UPPPPPPPP!!!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Eh...!? Why the sudden sleeper hold!?  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I give up! I give up! I give up!  
I'm tapping out! I'm tapping out!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They've started fighting each other!  
Master, let's take them out now!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, I don't really understand why...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...but my body is telling me that black knight needs to get mashed up...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...just like Gawain's potato dishes!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Get him, Masherker!  
   
**Mash:**   
Right! Prepare to die!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
D-Deep breaths!  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right! Mash Kyrielight, taking deep breaths!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In... Out... In... Out...  
In... Out... In... Out...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Okay, ready to crush him!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
She's too pumped up!  
  
   
  
   
**Tristan:**   
It's the enemy!  
Th-The enemy's here! The enemy!  
  
   
**Mysterious Black Knight:**   
ENEMYYYYYYYYY!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Now!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mysterious Black Knight:**   
LOSERRRRRRRRRRRRR!!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
We lost... How sad...  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
Sir Tristan and Sir Lan&ndash; I mean, the Mysterious Black Knight have been defeated!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Anyway! This town is going to celebrate Halloween!  
I won't allow any complaints!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That goes for you guys too.  
Here, wear these and go celebrate!  
  
   
**Queen's Knight:**   
A jack-o'-lantern? Uh, wait, let me at least remove my helm&mdash;  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Save it.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Those knights ran away crying...  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Probably because you cursed those pumpkins with your Egyptian magecraft or what have you. They'll never come off now.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Thank you, Nitocris!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...Well, it is Halloween after all.  
Anyway, Elisabeth.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Now the townspeople can prepare for the festivities without having to be afraid of the queen.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's true!  
Okay, everyone! We drove all the knights away!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Feel safe to openly celebrate Halloween!  
  
   
**Mysterious Black Knight:**   
GOOOOOOOOOD...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
You seem quite happy, considering we lost...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Still, I'm glad too.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
She matures fast... I was so sure it would've taken at least ten years...  
  
   
**Mysterious Black Knight:**   
QUEEEEEEEEEEEN!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Yes. Now she has won the right to face the queen.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Now it's a question of whether or not she can surpass her. This is something we must see with our own eyes.  
  
   
**Mysterious Black Knight:**   
ESCAAAAAAAAAAAPE!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Yes, let's take flight. Quietly now.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hey, they're fleeing!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Easy.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
How rude...!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
The vanquished should hang their heads and await punishment!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Surround them, Medjed!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
How sad... But naturally, a knight never gives up!  
Not until he draws his last breath!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
The game is not over until the whistle blows...!  
  
   
**Mysterious Black Knight:**   
WINNERRRRRRRRRRR!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Now, let us escape!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
...So, it was you.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Step aside, young one. You're clearly not one of us.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
As you can see, I am the embodiment of chivalrous ideals, dreams, and realities. I would never lay a hand on a woman.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
That holds true even for non-humans like you. In fact, if you were a decade or so older, I would have liked to have dinner with you.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...However, given the murderous look on your face, I shall use an Evade skill on myself. Just to be safe.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
That wind-cutting bow of yours...  
So you're the scumbag responsible!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
“Great Grudge of Rashomon”!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Oh my...! A Noble Phantasm that removes buffs...  
How awful!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Here's another one for you!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Go, Sogen-bi! You're going to pay for what you did to my cake!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
“Great Grudge of Rashomon”! Raaarrrrgh!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Two in a row! How... agile...  
  
   
**Mysterious Black Knight:**   
STUUUUUPIIIIIIIID!!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Hm, not good. I should have sent them flying the opposite way.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
They went flying towards the pyramid.  
...It's like we set them free ourselves.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Th-Things like that happen in battle, you know.  
It's not my fault!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(In Shuten's ASMR voice) Oh, but it is.  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Eeeeeek! Shuten!?  
Shuten, I&ndash;Why yooou...!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Amazing, Master. That impression was not good at all, but it had an intensity to it.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(In Shuten's ASMR voice) All your fault, Ibaraki. How sad...  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Nyafu!?  
...Huh, Shuten? No? Where'd she go?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
...Why you...! What trickery is this!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There, there, Ibaraki. Calm down.  
  
   
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Anyway, this town has been liberated!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Even if the queen tries to stop the festivities, there's no way they ever will!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Ahh, the world is filled with the happiness of Halloween...! It makes me want to burst out singing!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Let's not do that. We'll just get sent back to the starting point again.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Why's that!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh? The children...  
  
   
**H：Child:**   
Yayyy, trick or treat!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, m-me!? I'm sorry...  
I don't have any candy...  
  
   
**H：Child:**   
Then trick it is!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, trick!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, you too!?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou just gave them the sesame buns that the doctor was hiding!  
  
   
**H：Child:**   
Yay, sweets!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Phew. You saved me, Fou.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Hrmm, hrmm. (Om nom nom)  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Hey, it's not enough.  
And I'm tired of this flavor already.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I want something a little more like confectionery!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, I'm sorry.  
How about these macarons then...?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
What are these?  
They look great! Such vibrant colors!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
And this texture... They're soft, but solid enough to be broken apart... Ah! They're all mushy inside!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Oh, wait. What's this? They have different flavors and colors!? Matcha! Chestnut! Strawberry! Pistachio!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
It's like a kaleidoscope of sweets!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, kids love macarons...  
No wonder they hit the spot for Ibaraki-Douji...  
  
   
**H：Child:**   
Halloween's so fun!  
  
   
**H：Mother:**   
Yes it is, very fun.  
  
   
**H：Father:**   
Look, it's a pumpkin monster!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's finally starting to feel like Halloween.  
Right, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This is how it should be.  
   
**Mash:**   
Exactly!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
To properly hold and run a festival is also the job of a pharaoh.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I hope that child begins to understand that soon.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Halloween sure is fun.  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Well, people need to take breaks at times. Although as a person coming from the forest, I hate rowdy places.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
You say that, but I know you're secretly handing out candy to the kids.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
What!? But I never sensed your eyes on me!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Kahahaha, I disguised myself as a child and received some too!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Have you no shame...?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Humph, call me clever, you spineless candyman.  
I just have a different sense of pride, that is all.  
  
   
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Now let's go pay the queen a visit! My concert will&mdash;No, never mind. The concert is also important, but...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
But most of all, in order for everyone to enjoy Halloween, we need to take her out!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I kind of understand what you're trying to say, Fou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Even as a Heroic Spirit stopped in time, one can still understand and learn something new.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...That is true.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Even if it is like a single night's dream, the experience will not have been in vain.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Mash Kyrielight.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...I'm sorry, it's nothing. It doesn't seem like you need my words of advice.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
H-Huh...?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Now, let us go. And let us face that gatekeeper once more.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...By the way, maybe one song wouldn't hurt before we go...?  
  
   
**H：All:**   
ABSOLUTELY NOT!  
  
   
## Section 10: "Pumpkin Harvest! Part 1"  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
There's another pumpkin here!  
It's harvesting time!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Can you really call it harvesting if it's just taking pumpkins off their heads?  
  
   
## Section 11: "Pumpkin Harvest! Part 2"  
   
**Nitocris:**   
There's even pumpkins in my cave...!  
Let's slay them right away.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
My apologies, Elisabeth, but this cave does not need any Halloween decorations!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
The reason is... Yes, the reason is...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...jack-o'-lanterns have too much overlap with the Medjed design!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
All right, that'll do for today.  
We'll harvest more pumpkins tomorrow!  
  
   
## Section 12: "Pumpkin Harvest! Part 3"  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It's freezing, so run through as fast you can!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Right. I love the feeling of a cold piece of chocolate melting in my mouth, but it's so cold my teeth will break over it!  
  
   
## Section 13: "Pumpkin Harvest! Part 4"  
   
**Mash:**   
...It seems those three aren't here.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's hurry!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
R-Right. I don't know what they'll do now that they figured out they were tricked, and I don't want to know!  
  
   
## Section 14: "Let's Sing a Song"  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Um, uh...  
Trick or treat, Uncle Vlad!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I can hear the festival... Did you yourself realize why I was angry, or did someone bring it to your attention?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
If the former, then you show some promise.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
If the latter, then they showed you sympathy.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
The verdict looks only at the results. If the people were satisfied, then you have the right to proceed.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Uncle Vlad!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
However, in this form I am especially strict with you.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
You have committed many sins...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
One of which I, having become a Heroic Spirit, simply cannot ignore.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...I won't say to atone for it with death.  
For there is no way to atone.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
As a king, I demonstrate magnanimity while I suffer within. But as a warrior, I shall never show mercy toward wickedness.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
You... Evil killer who committed depraved acts, toyed with the citizens, and thought it only natural to be ignorant...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Your sins are a nightmare from which no one can wake, even after 100 years. What you have done is committed a crime engraved in history.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
It is time you return to the darkness where no one can venture. I shall slaughter every last one of you.  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...I would have never thought my skill with a lance would come up short against a fictional creature&ndash;a vampire.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I must be the one who is unworthy.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
U-Um... Uncle Vlad?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
You have no right to call me that. You should refer to me as “uncle” when I'm summoned as king.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I told you before. Each different aspect of a particular hero manifests as its own distinct Servant.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Like what has happened with me here, now.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
But, but even so... you're still Uncle Vlad.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Even though you may hate me.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Even though I may have done things that are unforgivable.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
You have indeed. You committed a sin... though the world may not consider it that way.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
That sin is not even engraved upon your Spirit Origin. After all, that world has been forgotten.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...But I shall never forget.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
You denied the final integrity of my light, my wife, my love.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
For her sake, I will not forgive you.  
Even if she herself may have...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Elisabeth...  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...I see. I somewhat recall it too.  
Man, humanity being in a state of flux is a nuisance.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That Vlad III and Elisabeth had a bit of a history together.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
This isn't about who's right and who's wrong.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
The World isn't concerned by human values like virtue. It will just adopt whatever means are useful to guarantee the continuation of its existence.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Whether it's a young lady who tries to atone for her grave sins, even if she knows no shame...  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...or the conviction of a gentleman who won't accept any kind of atonement, but just seeks to punish every evil act... The World considers them equally sinful.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Right. They're the same, so it will choose the one that's more effective&ndash;even someone evil, if it means preserving humanity.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If humanity's preservation isn't wished for, they won't be allowed to be summoned as a Heroic Spirit. Even if they stand for righteousness.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But if that's the case, it means even Vlad III wishes for the preservation of humanity.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
After all, he was summoned as a Servant this time.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
...I think you're right. I hate humans.  
I don't like them and I don't trust them.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
That being said, I have no intention of destroying their world. After all, humans are useful for a number of things.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I exist because humans, my enemies, exist. In a world without humans, neither Shuten nor I would be summoned.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Isn't that true, Red Horns?  
No matter how many sins you've committed...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
No one can reject your being here right now. As long as you don't wish for “nothingness,” you'll be a Heroic Spirit like the rest of us.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Of course, as an Anti-Hero... A sacrifice whose role is to lose to the Heroic Spirits.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...You're right. Thanks, Ibaraki.  
I'm grateful.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Now then... Sorry for making you wait, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet].  
Come! To the final battle with the queen!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, let's go!  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Nice reaction!  
Thank you, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
After we take the castle back, I'll let you help me prepare for my concert!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, Master's face suddenly went pale.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll follow you anywhere, Elly!  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Heh... It makes my heart flutter to be called a pet name by a fan...!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
All right, I'll specially reserve a front-row seat for you at my concert!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What's wrong!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru is displaying signs of being in an incredibly agitated mental state...!  
  
   
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
   
Why!?  
  
   
**???:**  
Mmmm, don't tell me they really made it!?  
Were my countermeasures too flimsy!?  
  
   
**???:**  
No, no, calm down. Calm down.  
Everyone makes mistakes. I'm no exception.  
  
   
**???:**  
Rather, a beautiful queen is the only one allowed to make careless mistakes. Paradoxically, those mistakes are what make her a queen in the first place!  
  
   
**???:**  
Yes, that's right. That proves I'm not at fault here. Therefore...  
  
   
**???:**  
Rise, you useless loser knights!  
Next up is an all-out war.  
  
   
**???:**  
The time has come to make it clear who's best suited to rule this land!  
  
   
**???:**  
I too... have a wish, and to make it come true, I shall continue being the queen!  
  
   
**???:**  
That is the agreement I made with that person!  
  
   
## Section 15: "Trick or Treat!"  
   
**Tristan:**   
Welcome. Thank you for coming.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hey, it's the knights that ran away.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
That depends on how you look at it.  
Things must be observed from up high...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
This is called a “bird's-eye view.” It looked like I was about to lose, so I, Tristan the Sad, threw the match.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
In other words, by giving up on winning, I avoided defeat. I am a quick-witted man almost to the point of sadness...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That is certainly sad, in every sense of the word...  
  
   
**Mysterious Black Knight:**   
FWWWWUUUUUUUUUU...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, I have a strange feeling about that black knight. Trying to whistle but not quite getting it and whatnot.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We should focus on taking them out right here...  
Or perhaps we could just have a nice, long chat...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
W-Will you be okay?  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Either way, that black knight is our enemy.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash, relax.  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm fine. I'm calm right now! Now, let's fight!  
  
   
  
   
**Tristan:**   
(Oh, how terrible... That seemingly gentle girl has the menacing look of an executioner.)  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
(What did you do to make her hate you so much?)  
  
   
**Mysterious Black Knight:**   
(I'm sorry... But I don't remember. I think it's some sort of misunderstanding. She'll calm down soon enough.)  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
(Really...? So it's not dangerous?  
As in something that would end up involving me?)  
  
   
**Mysterious Black Knight:**   
(N-No, it's nothing, probably.)  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Good to know. Ahem.  
Her Majesty awaits. This way, please.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
We finally get to see her...  
[♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet], get psyched.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Don't get fooled by her unorthodox attitude and appearance.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Inside there's a nastiness boiling up like a poisonous stew!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Do you know her True Name?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Nope, not at all!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...Well, given that there's a pyramid, it must be someone who has something to do with me.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...Let me double-check. She really is a queen, right?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Because I'll be forced to surrender if it turns out to be some extravagant man with eyes like the sun and a beautiful voice...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Don't worry. She's a woman for sure.  
Just her true nature is different.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I may be a dragon, but she's a snake&ndash;a fiercely venomous one at that!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
I see you haven't learned anything from your two defeats. How dare you come here, you little lizard!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
I fail to understand how you are so pathetic, but I shall praise you for surviving this hell twice!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
But you are still merely a girl crazy about Halloween! To someone tempered by the hot desert sand like myself, you&mdash;  
  
   
**C：???:**  
...Am I seeing things? Is there one less of you? ...Wait. You look stronger than before!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Heh, for you to notice that...  
That's some observation you got there.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Yes, I was born once more through a Palingenesis-like process from the humiliation of having everything taken from me, and my own self-denial...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I am the muscle-based idol that has become a Saber-class Servant, Elisabeth Báthory (Brave)!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh I get it now...! (At last)  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That's right. Everyone just kept quiet.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Really? I honestly thought she was a salamander Heroic Spirit...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'm not a fire lizard! I'm a female hero! A noble heroine blessed by a dragon! Someone who never sings out of tune!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You just came up with that on the spot, didn't you?  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Hehe. I've actually been thinking about it for a while, just didn't have a chance to say it.  
  
   
  
   
**C：???:**  
Are you done yet? Eyes back on me!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Ahem. Anyway, you've done well to make your way here, heroes! I shall praise you for your spirit!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So beautiful...!  
   
**C：???:**  
Heh. I'm tired of hearing that, but thank you!  
It's good to be honest!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...!  
   
**C：???:**  
Indeed. A beauty so great you would lose your words. That is I!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
If you understand, then bow to the ground until you bang your head! I'll also allow you to take photos of me, this time only!  
  
   
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Bow before Her Majesty. You're not going to listen to me anyway, but...  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Don't just tell them without even meaning it, you dumb dodo! You do nothing but fail!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
It's your own incompetence that has allowed them to come this far! As punishment, do a handstand over there!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
But don't stop playing the harp!  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
So sad... So backbreaking. But if Her Majesty commands it, I must obey.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You can actually do it!?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Also...  
  
   
**Mysterious Black Knight:**   
...  
  
   
**C：???:**  
It seems that the current situation is punishment enough for Sir Anonymous here. Very well, I will let him off the hook.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, I think it's only fair that he gets punished too. Specifically, he has to take off his helmet or show us his face.  
  
   
**Mysterious Black Knight:**   
...!!!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Umm... Mash...?  
You're acting kinda scary...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Really?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sorry... When I look at that indecisive black knight, my heart becomes as jagged as a Saint Quartz...  
  
   
**C：???:**  
So you get irritated. That was a nice way to put it.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
I completely understand how you feel, but have your fight elsewhere.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
It's a drag, but first I have my duty as a ruler.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Elisabeth Báthory, the fact that you've made it here means you finally understand, yes?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Yes.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I got too excited over the Halloween concert and neglected my duties as ruler.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...I was too immature to rule over the common pigs.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Yes, it is pure stupidity for those who stand on top to seek something other than being at the top!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
To be served you need a reason to be served.  
Or you need fervor!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
That reason may be that you're as beautiful as the heavens. It could be that you wield power, even though you're hideous.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh, that stings... I'm as beautiful as the heavens, but I chose the life of an idol...  
  
   
**C：???:**  
No, I'm the beautiful one.  
You're the powerful one.  
  
   
**C：???:**  
You said it yourself just a second ago. You're the muscle-based idol, Lowland Gorilla Báthory.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I didn't say that! Only the Báthory part is right!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Now that you mention it, you're right, but who cares about the small things! We're having an important discussion right now!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's my line! I've never had so much trouble talking to someone before!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Just who are you?!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You act like some sort of model, but what Heroic Spirit are you?!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Isn't it obvious? A queen who rules with beauty!  
Whose name is synonymous with beauty!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
If you asked a hundred people who that queen is, they would all tell you my name!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Yes, my name!  
My beautiful name is...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, that'd be Cleopatra.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Obviously, Cleopatra.  
   
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Seriously?! You mean that Paris Fashion Week girl is Queen Cleopatra...!?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Ohohohoho. Even a girl with the bare minimum of nobility like you knows my name.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Then I shall ask again.  
Can you compete against my beauty?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...This is bad. When it comes to whose Heroic Spirit is more beautiful, she has the upper hand...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
No matter how you look at it, my style is more modern, but I can't beat her brand reputation...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Modern?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Style?  
   
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What, are you saying my bikini armor is old-school!?  
It's totally modern! Right!?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Yes, I think that outfit is good. It would make perfect sense in Ancient Egypt.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I know, right? Finally somebody from Egypt gets me!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
To me you both look the sa&mdash;No, never mind.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
But, well, in terms of looking dignified, the queen over there is on a different level. Her self-confidence has no limits.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I don't know what to say. My standards of beauty are different from humans' to begin with.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
That being said... Hahahahaha!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Master! Master! She has an ulterior motive, and a malicious one at that.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Like she'll bite you or tear you up if you get close.  
Well, I guess for a demon, that's pretty beautiful!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Hmm... You're not human, huh?  
Then it makes sense you can't understand me.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
And also...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
You...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Quiet, Cleopatra. I simply ended up on this side by chance this time.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I am just a normal Caster, a mage. You just need to live up to your beliefs without wavering.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...Yes.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
So, Elisabeth, let me ask you again.  
Do you intend to compete with my beauty?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Ha...hahahaha! Ohohoho! No way, that would be impossible! That's not even a contest!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
If you're a woman, then you know there's nothing more terrifying than being judged based on your beauty!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I am the world-renowned Cleopatra!  
That contest would only make you lose face...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? I can compete.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...What was that?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It's true that if we're just talking how our bodies look, my physical age might put me at a very slight disadvantage...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
In any event, diversification is in right now. There are more standards of beauty now than there were in the past. Espeeeeecially...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Yes! What about cuteness?  
I sing, dance, and smile for my pig fans!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's something only an idol like me can do! And something a queen, who is served on every day, cannot!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
In other words, you're not someone that rules over others...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's right! Your Majesty, I challenge you to a duel!  
As an idol!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh, and of course I'll take up the reins of government. An idol can rule just fine.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
How dare you... How dare you...  
You have no idea how mad your proposal makes me...!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Beauty is born from intelligence.  
Thus, ruling is carried out through beauty...!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Ruling over the masses merely because you're “cute”...  
As a queen, I won't allow such happy-go-lucky attitudes!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(I kind of get why Cleopatra is mad...)  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
(No, Elisabeth is just that selfish. After all, she's an Anti-Hero...someone who's been making mistakes her whole life.)  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'm an idol, and the mistress of Castle Csejte!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Servants get summoned as Lancers, Casters, and so on, right?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Just like Uncle Vlad accepted me for who I am and didn't forgive me&mdash;  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'm greedy, prideful, and selfish.  
That's why both versions of me are important!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I won't give up on either one!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
So you're not going to give up...on either of you?  
This is why regional rulers are so annoying...!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Very well, we'll see just how long you can keep that attitude. I'll test you!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...At the end of the day, you're just spouting nonsense! Drown in the beauty of Cleopatra...and die!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Tristan:**   
...Splendid. This is different than before.  
A complete defeat...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Ha... Excellent. Truly excellent.  
A splended defeat is quite exhilarating.  
  
   
**Mysterious Black Knight:**   
(I'm not sure about that...  
I feel like we fought for nothing...!)  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...I can't believe it. I didn't think I would lose...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
The match is over! You're going to give me back Castle Csejte!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
And do something about this pyramid!  
Actually, don't bring this kind of stuff in here!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...That's... kind of difficult...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...Well, I'm not the one who brought this pyramid here.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Then who dropped this annoying thing on my castle?!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Well...  
  
   
**G：???:**  
IT WAS ME!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Who are you!?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Th-That voice...!?  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
It can't be?! It couldn't, could it!?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
If you want to know who I am, I shall answer.  
I am Ozymandias, the king who rules the sun!!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Hahahaha! Cleopatra!  
They've completely crushed you!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
H-How embarrassing! As someone who holds the name of pharaoh, I have fallen hard...!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I cannot bear any additional embarrassment.  
Please sever my head!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I don't want you making a bloody mess here!  
We're going to decorate for Halloween!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Yes. Just as that thin girl over there says.  
We need to decorate this castle now.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Your blood would ruin the festival. Your punishment will be to sit there and take your shame!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Yes, Your Majesty!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ozymandias... In other words, Ramesses II! To think someone so important would show up in this weird Singularity...!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's like an adult showing up to a kid's event, you know!?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Adults have fun, too. Grown-ups enjoy this kind of levity!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
But that's why you should not worry.  
I will not fight.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Cleopatra was ruling over this pyramid, and was defeated by you.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I would have never thought Your Majesty... If you had given me word... I wouldn't have joined their side...  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Heh. Don't say that, Nitocris.  
I told Cleopatra to keep her mouth shut.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I-I'm not displeased at all!  
My apologies for slipping my tongue!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Umm, I'm not really following what you guys are saying. Why are people from Egypt here?  
  
   
**Both:**   
HOW DISRESPECTFUL!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Whyaun!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I can't help it! I don't know if I'm being disrespectful!  
I don't know what's going on!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That's right. You guys really have no connection to this place whatsoever, so why are you here?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Umph, No Face King of the Forest.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
...Very well. It's no fun just seeing you all rack your brains.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Then I shall ask you. Does anyone know the final moments of this woman, Cleopatra?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They say she committed suicide after her husband Antonius, general of the Roman army...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...lost to Augustus in the naval battle of Actium and later died.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
That's right. The Ptolemaic Kingdom quickly collapsed and the country disappeared.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Leaving her as the last pharaoh.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
And thus, she has avoided wishing for anything, and refused to be summoned as a Servant until now.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...What do you mean?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
She has a personal desire.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
And it's something that won't come true unless she participates in a Holy Grail War as a Servant.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
But it's not a wish as a pharaoh. It's a selfish desire you could find anywhere on the streets.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
She feels so responsible for the destruction of her country that she has locked it away in her heart.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Thinking that someone that has done what she did should not be allowed to have a wish!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
But I don't think it's something to be suffering over for a thousand or so years, so I gave her an opportunity.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
To rule this upside-down pyramid as queen...  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
...Until Halloween ends.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
And had she done that, I would have granted her wish with the Holy Grail I was given.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A Holy Grail...!?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
And then you lost. You have no objections.  
Right, Cleopatra?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...Correct.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I realized that it's wrong for someone like me to hope for something.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
I see, and so you're going to suppress that wish and turn your back on it for the rest of eternity, then!?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
That is the least I can do to atone for destroying my country.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
...Heh.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Hahahahaha! Hahahahahahaha!!  
That's your answer!?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Ridiculous! Anubis would be holding his belly laughing, I imagine! Did you hear that, thin girl?!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I told you to call me Elisabeth! Or if you want to be more friendly, Elly is also good!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Huh. I see. In that case, Elly, or whatever, if you have something to say, you should say it now!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
I appreciate that ridiculous arrogance of yours!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Did you just say Elly!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Then I'll say it.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Umm... You know, Cleopatra...  
You're an...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
IDIOT!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Aren't you?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
What...!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Didn't I tell you? That I would be both an idol and a ruler!?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You can be a pha... pharaoh? and have a personal desire at the same time!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Take part in a bunch of Holy Grail Wars, and do your best to get it granted!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Why can't you do the things that I can do?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You can do it right? I bet you could do it while you dance gracefully even.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
That's...!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I don't want to say this, but...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I got all excited about being an idol, I forgot about Halloween, so you might have ruled a bit... better, maybe.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You can have your own personal desires!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...Are you sure...  
I don't know if I can&mdash;  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It's fine! You think so too, right [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Humanity's final Master, Fujimaru!  
You look like you want to say something.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
It's fine! Finish her off!  
Don't hold back and tell her!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You can be selfish.  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Selfish...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...You're right.  
I've wanted to be, this entire time.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You do you, Cleopatra.  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Be...myself...  
You're right.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
That's what I've been trying to be this whole time, but...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
At some point, all I could think about was being a pharaoh...  
  
   
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Sun King, Ozymandias.  
Incarnation of Horus, Queen Nitocris.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Please forgive me. From this day forth, I will accept myself for who I am, and not just be a pharaoh.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I forgive you. Become the strength needed for those that follow you. Act like the name you have carved into history.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
I too grant forgiveness. Have the name of Cleopatra shine brightly, arrogantly, and proudly!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
My name is Cleopatra VII.  
A former pharaoh.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
From this day forward, I will answer the summons as a Heroic Spirit and protect human history.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
When that happens, I will use this beautiful face, this voice, this body to be an Assassin class Servant.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
In other words... My glory is wasted on you.  
Give it up and resign yourself to it!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'd welcome you any time!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Th-That was a good answer, Fujimaru! You've been wonderful this far. Now you just need to rest!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
All right. Everything's good now!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Mhh. So is everything done here? (Crunch, crunch)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ibaraki-Douji... Slow down when you eat.  
There will be plenty of candy once Halloween begins.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I'm not eating. I'm not eating any candy.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...So what was that selfish wish, anyway?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Th-That...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
I've never heard of your wish.  
Would you tell us, if you don't mind?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Yes, if that's what you want, Your Majesty.  
My wish... Well, I have several, but...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I'd like to see the man I loved one more time. I don't really want to get back together with him, but...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I still remember...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
The day he whispered sweet nothings into my ear while holding me in his slender but strong arms...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
His chiseled features, his cheek bones ever so tempting... And he was so sincere...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Yes... I'd like to see my Caesar again...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
...  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...  
  
   
**Mysterious Black Knight:**   
...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
What happened?  
Has the last boss made their appearance?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Everyone, emergency huddle.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
This is bad. She's talking about THAT Caesar, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Caesar, one of the three least trustworthy Servants in Chaldea, and almost always the mastermind behind everything.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...By the way, this is what Chaldea's Caesar looks like.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
...!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Gahgh!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...They both passed out.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh no. It looks like King Ozymandias is holding his stomach and trying to hold back his laughter...  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yeah, it's quite a shock to see Caesar for the first time...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Should we tell her the truth?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I don't think we should...  
We would be destroying her dream...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...But we should tell her someday.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
How sad... People change...  
They say aging isn't ugly, but...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
...This goes beyond aging...  
Please forget this song...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
This is definitely a severe case of stress eating...  
Oh, how sad...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I have only seen this level of stress in Agravain...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
You look like you're having fun over there!  
Let me join in too!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
And why are the great pharaohs collapsed on the floor like they had a sudden stomach ache or something!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
H-Hold on a second!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? What's wrong?  
Did you call me? Want me to answer?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
W-Wait. Hold on!  
Don't just Rayshift without my permi&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor?  
Doctor...!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
H-He really did Rayshift...!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
This is bad!  
That means...!  
  
   
**???:**  
VENI!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...!  
This voice...!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh... He really did come...  
  
   
**???:**  
VIDI!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
My Caesar...!?  
To think I can meet you again at last!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I-I need a mirror.  
Does anyone have a mirror!?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Is my makeup running? We were just fighting after all!  
Is it okay? Is it okay!?  
  
   
**???:**  
Now all I have to do is show myself!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
My Cae&mdash;  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
IT IS I!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
WHAT!?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Hahaha. It's been a while, Cleopatra. Hmm? I guess this is the first time meeting each other as Servants.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
... (THUD)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yeah, I thought so...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
I guess she couldn't accept reality and escaped it by fainting...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Humans are frail beings. They should just be positive as long as they have something to strive for.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, a Holy Grail fragment came out.  
I'm going to collect it.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...Uuugh... Round... I saw something round...  
Rolling... Rolling around... Uuuugh...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...I can't tell her to leave with the pyramid right now...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Let's have her rest here until her emotional scars heal.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Once Halloween starts, she might calm down a little bit too.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, let's all have a very fun Halloween for her sake too!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Very well!  
So who should I trick&mdash;I mean, persuade?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I haven't made much of an appearance lately!  
My wit is so sharp right now, it's on par with a Lancer!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You should stay away until Cleopatra's emotional scars heal...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...
