# Da Vinci and the 7 Counterfeit Heroic Spirits  
  
## Prologue: "Lisa del Giocondo's Graceful Holiday"  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
&ndash;I can't believe this.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
This is impossible. It's just not possible,  
but...this is without a doubt “me.”  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Wait, no. This is “me,” and yet it isn't.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The skill is not all there, but the passion is.  
That passion is forcing “me” to become more like “me.”  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Actually, I'm a little bit put off by this passion...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The passion on this canvas... It's like wearing layers of coats in the summer, with the heat on full blast, and eating hot udon all at the same time.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
How do I know!? That's because I'm always a perver...  
I mean, passionate!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Anyway, back on topic.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Curse you! Who would do something so blasphemous!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I can't just sit around like this. At this rate, Romani will lecture me... I mean...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
This is a problem that could cause the Foundation of Humanity to collapse, thus creating a new Singularity!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Okay! Activating emergency alarm system!  
Everyone, assemble!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Trace ...On.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see... So this is how you create your twin blades.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I was wondering how you get them back so fast every time they shatter.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou.  
Fou, fou.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Yes. However, it's more accurate to say that I create a copy that's not better or worse than the original.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
No matter how similar it is to the real thing, it's never as strong. I guess fiction is too light to support the weight of reality.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Although my projections must be similar to the originals. However, even if I create an identical copy, it's no more than reflections on the surface of water.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
They're nothing more than counterfeits, different from the originals.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Different in what way?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It would take a while to explain everything, so let me skip that for now.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
However, that doesn't mean the counterfeits will always perform worse than the originals, if we're just talking numbers.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
If both of them perform equally well, it's not the “objects” themselves that decide which is better, but the “audience.”  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It's not really a nice topic for the people who made the originals...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
However, humans are a species that constantly aims for the future. The concept of improvement is necessary to move forward.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Originals made from scratch are valuable, yes,  
but so are the imitations derived from them.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
My projections are just copies, but the imitations in this world are originals that have been developed further.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
What starts from one expands out into infinite possibilities and shapes the future.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see. That's very deep.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Anyway, let's get back to cleaning the rooms.  
Master, are you keeping your room clean?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I always keep it clean.  
   
**Emiya:**   
Excellent. One's room is the reflection of their mind.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The fact that you keep your room tidy reflects your personality.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sometimes it gets messy.  
   
**Emiya:**   
Oh, you mean at Halloween and Christmas?  
Remember, one's room is the reflection of their mind.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
In other words, you are the type that gets excited whenever there's an event.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hehehe, he's right on the spot, huh?  
Senpai.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Hmm?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The emergency alarm...  
Something is happening, Senpai!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, is there an emergency?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry I'm late!  
What was that emergency alarm just now?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You just got here?  
Wait, aren't you the one who sounded the alarm?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'd feel better if that was me, but it wasn't.  
Normally I'd be tuning Chaldea's reactor at this hour.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Then, who could it be?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Ahem. Testing, testing! Testing, testing! As this is an emergency situation, I have taken over the intercom.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Attention all Servants who can stand by and accept our Master's recklessness with a smile.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Empty your minds and come to my workshop immediately!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Of course, you are to bring your weapons.  
Oh, Romani is annoying so he can't come.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You have one minute!  
Now hop to it!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Hey, what happened?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...It seems to be something she can't say for now. Anyway, let's head over there.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, there you are! As expected, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I knew you'd come, too, Mash! Hmm, and it looks like you've also brought... Huh, only Emiya?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I thought surely seven nosy Servants would be lured here...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I think once they found out the alarm was from the Da Vinci Workshop, none of them wanted to come anymore.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I on the other hand was already talking to Fujimaru, so I simply tagged along.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Whaaaaat? Am I really that unpopular?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Of course. Maybe you should change that attitude of yours. I heard even Dr. Tesla can understand other people's feelings more.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Ugh. Romani. Why did you come? I told you not to!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If you tell someone not to come, of course their curiosity will get the better of them!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What did you do this time?  
I may be a coward, but even I get mad sometimes.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You misunderstand. This time it's not just my problem, but the entirety of Chaldea's problem.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This time?  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Excuse me. This time, and every time.  
I am your technical advisor, after all.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sounds like trouble.  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's right. We're in such big trouble I feel like my rationality is gonna be gone like Astolfo.  
  
   
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Okay, there's no time. I will get to the point!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I have reached the truth of this world.  
At last, I have identified its lies!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, hello? Medical team? Do you have a spare bed?  
We have a weirdo here who's gone insane.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
If you're not going to listen then leave!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Doctor, I know how you feel, but let's hear her out for now.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Regardless of his personality, he&ndash; I mean she is the universal genius, Leonardo da Vinci.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
There has to be some truth in her words, right?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, I suppose so, but...  
That's what makes it worse.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yes, as expected from the Hero of Wrought Iron.  
Nice save, Emiya!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Makers will never forget how to respect one another. Maybe Romani should show more respect for me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That would be an issue, Da Vinci.  
Now, what do you mean by the world's lies?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Right.  
First, take a look at this.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is&ndash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The infamous Mona Lisa!  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hahaha. I won't deny that. A lot of blood and money has been shed for this painting, hasn't it?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She has a smug look on her face for some reason, Senpai!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's truly the center of deceit!  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
How could you say that in front of the greatest painting in history? ...Well, I'll admit I made a ton of money copying and pasting the same painting.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She's admitting it, Senpai!  
  
   
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hahaha. Well, anyway.  
This is indeed the Craft Essence, Mona Lisa.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
However, this one wasn't made by my workshop.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...I could tell. It's very well-done, but it's a counterfeit. It's very meticulous, but I can sense anger from it as well.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It's a step below the one created by Ms. Da Vinci, which costs more than a thousand Mana Prisms, a VERY VALUABLE magical resource.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I sense sarcasm in your words, but that's right!  
This is a counterfeit!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
To think someone would... Copy! My! MONA LISA!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I don't mean copy-and-paste!  
Each was painted from scratch!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's amazing.  
I can't tell the difference at all.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
You can spot a poorly made counterfeit from the technique.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
If it's a well-made counterfeit, you can naturally tell the difference from the aura it gives off.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
All creative works, not just swords, contain the ideals, emotions, and likes and dislikes of the one who made them.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
If one is desperate... No, if one puts their life on the line to feel the same way the original creator did, then it would be hard to tell the difference.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
This Mona Lisa...is incredible in its intensity and passion. Unfortunately, what it's lacking in is technique.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It's a rare counterfeit that seeks to make up for its lack of skill with passion. Usually it's the other way around.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Indeed. By the way, is your class Artist?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It's Archer. So, what's wrong with this counterfeit?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
There's nothing wrong with having a passionate follower, right? Isn't that what all creators want?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Actually... Mona Lisa hasn't been selling well lately.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Have they ever?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What? They did at one point?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
THEY DO SELL!  
They're the biggest hit from my workshop!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But all of a sudden they stopped selling!  
I thought it was strange and went to look, and found this!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
At first glance, they look the same and kinda have similar effects, but the price is only a tenth of the original!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm sure you understand what I'm trying to say now, right!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No one is buying Mona Lisa from Da Vinci?  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I didn't want to hear it...  
But you're right!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're useless now?  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The truth is so cruel...  
But that's what will happen at this rate!  
  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Right, right. So basically an underworld broker is selling better Craft Essences for cheaper than Da Vinci's workshop.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What's wrong with that? You're supposed to be in charge of Sheba and the summoning system anyway.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No one likes this workshop anyway,  
so maybe you can just let the fake&mdash;  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I will straight-up murder you, Romani.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, right! Sorry!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Ahem. Oopsies! My real personality came out☆  
Back to what we were saying&mdash;  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Listen. Whoever's making this counterfeit is undeniably evil!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
(...I don't know. It feels twisted, but the passion within it is pure...)  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And so, Fujimaru, I want you to find out who's making these...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...and defeat them, no questions asked!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Finding and arresting an underworld broker?  
That doesn't sound like Senpai's job...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
No, it most certainly is Fujimaru's job.  
I mean, whoever is doing it can only be evil.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
They must be the kind of demon that's filled with enough maliciousness to destroy this world.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
They're probably the strongest enemy you've ever faced, but don't worry! This time... I'll be going with you!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Gwah!? No, no! What are you saying, Leonardo?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Chaldea needs you! If you're defeated, our effectiveness will drop by half!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As the person in charge here, I can't allow that!  
You can't leave over something that doesn't matter...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm?  
It doesn't matter, you say?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&mdash;R-Right. Art is at the core of your soul, huh?  
I'll get the Rayshift ready.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Weak...  
   
**Mash:**   
That's Da Vinci for you...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Doctor...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Well, I can't think of a way to stop Leonardo if she's already this angry...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And to tell the truth, we can't ignore the question of where these counterfeits are coming from.  
  
   
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Oh, right. I had a pressure cooker running in my room. The beef for my stew should be done now.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey! Emiya!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Tch! I was too late!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah! Emiya-senpai, you were trying to run, weren't you?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
No... I wasn't... Fine, I was.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It's just that I'm busy. I have to tune my weapons, clean my room, chat with the operator girl...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
As you can see, a Servant has many duties.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Good point, but I've already finished cleaning all the rooms.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
W-Well... You see...  
These kind of events aren't really my forte...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's go, Master, Emiya-senpai!  
Let's go on a journey to find the counterfeits!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The more, the merrier! Right now the more sensible Servants around the better.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I haven't had this bad a feeling since that space rocket! For Senpai's sake too! Please!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
So you're asking not for your own sake, but your Master's... In that case...Hmmm...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash is really growing up...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks, Mash. You're so dependable.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well done, Mash. We can all suffer together.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Of course. All I can do right now is keep you safe!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Humph. Very well. I give up.  
I'll go with you.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
So? Where are we going first?  
You must have some idea, Ms. Da Vinci.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Of course. Just leave that to me! Okay, Roman, I'm going to borrow the Rayshift for a bit.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Don't worry. With Fujimaru's help we can solve this is no time!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Off to the Rayshift we go!  
Wow, my first Rayshift! I'm so nervous!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Now, after tracing and observing the Spiritron information on the counterfeits, I've concluded they came from these coordinates in this era.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmmm, it's been so long since I stepped outside of Chaldea. The feeling of dirt, the breeze on my cheeks...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It's good to be alive, isn't it, Fujimaru?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Come, come, let's go find that jerk who's making all the counterfeits!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Da Vinci's really excited!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
She's been cooped up in her workshop until now.  
She's probably both an indoor and outdoor person.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Let's start by heading for the town.  
The first thing we need is information.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the town. It's very peaceful and pleasant.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Yes. Let's start with something basic.  
We'll show the counterfeit to someone passing by.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I understand.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Excuse me!  
  
   
**Both:**   
What is it?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Get 'em&mdash;!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Roger!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
That escalated quickly!  
Let's finish this and go home!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
What is this sudden attempt at arrest?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Every fight has its reasons.  
Even if we are in the wrong, shouldn't you tell us why!?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Some truths can only be found through dialogue!  
Let's talk about this! That's how I win!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I already know that talking with you is a trap that we can't fall into!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
What... Have we done business together once before!?  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
So it seems... How sad... Trust is such a fragile thing...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Quite the contrary!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right, Master!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Hmm... If conversation is impossible, I suppose I'll act like a politician, and settle things by force.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Because I'd like to get rid of the negative image that  
“if anything bad happens, it's probably Caesar!”  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
I agree, Caesar.  
I, P, know exactly how you feel.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
I'm opposed to violence, but I will join in the fight.  
Don't worry. It's possible to brainwash them mid-battle.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
I want to say this loud and clear!  
We are innocent&ndash;!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey, making someone laugh before battle is not right!  
I almost dropped my staff!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
How can you honestly claim that you're innocent?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're one to talk, Da Vinci!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're not exactly innocent either!  
   
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Both:**   
We swear we're innocent!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Caesar, is that true?  
   
**Caesar:**   
It's true!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Selling those counterfeits for cheap wouldn't bring in any money anyway.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
First I'd tell the customer that I'm offering the real Mona Lisas! Then I'd buy up all of the Craft Essences from Da Vinci.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Why? Because as long as I've got the real ones with me, the customers would be willing to pay full price...  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
without having to worry about them being fakes!  
To just distribute the counterfeits for free like that&mdash;  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I swear to you on my very soul.  
I would never do something so wasteful!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This Caesar is also the real thing!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Indeed. He knows that trust is the strongest foundation for a business.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
P, are you trying to do what you think's best, again?  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Even if I did make Mona Lisa counterfeits... I don't think that would have any good effect on the world.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
The Mona Lisa is the pinnacle of art.  
Not many paintings share that same level of fame.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Degrading it to the level of counterfeits is unthinkable even in the world of magecraft.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...However, if something can be created by sacrificing the original, I guess that would be all right...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It wouldn't be all right!  
My heart would sustain heavy damage!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
But... I guess the two of them aren't behind the counterfeits.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry...we got ahead of ourselves.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Humph. Don't be sad, oh girl who is plump and firm in a different way than me.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
After all, we secretly Rayshifted here because we heard about the rumors of the counterfeits.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I thought I could use Paracelsus as a decoy and brought him here... Hahaha, I didn't expect to get caught before we split up.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
It's embarrassing, but I thought the same thing.  
  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
I was going to stand behind Caesar and use Sword P to get rid of both him and the counterfeiter.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I think that mage over there needs to reconsider what “embarrassing” means... Anyway...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
For now, we're the ones asking questions. I would have you tell us everything you know about the counterfeits.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
We're sure there's a group of counterfeiters in this town. My “money sensor” tells me so.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
But there's one problem. I'm told a Servant is running the counterfeiter's workshop.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...What!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
A-A Servant!  
...I see. That explains it.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But who could it be? Michelangelo? Raphael?  
Or perhaps... Donatello?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
There's so many...  
Him? Her? Who?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I can guess what kind of relationships Leonardo da Vinci had in life.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I don't know who it is myself.  
Their workshop is here. Go pay them a visit.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Okay, thanks!  
Off to the counterfeiter's workshop, everyone!  
  
   
## Section 1: Counterfeit "The Innocent Boy"  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We're almost there.  
I'm picking up multiple enemy signals.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Be careful!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yuck. It looks just like my workshop!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And it's not just the Mona Lisa...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You're right! The Annunciation, the Vitruvian Man...  
Even the Last Supper!?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
They're better preserved than the ones that exist now in 2018.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm? What's this...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Is that your manuscript?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Let me see... Yes, this one's mine.  
However, this one's a counterfeit.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This one is the real one, and that one over there is a fake... Master, I can't tell the difference at all...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Me neither.  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Right? I doubt even the counterfeiter would be able to tell either.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can kind of tell.  
   
**Mash:**   
Wow, Master...  
You've got the sharpest eye in Chaldea.  
  
   
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci stretch for thousands of pages, and that's just what exists now.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It also uses mirror writing, which means making a counterfeit must've required a ton of effort.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I can understand the reason behind the Mona Lisa and the other paintings, but why the manuscripts?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Okay, let's take them all with us!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? All of them?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
One or two wouldn't be a problem, but to take all of these back with us...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What a pain!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
If you take them back for me,  
I'll trade them for items in my workshop.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's get to it!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Get them loaded up!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
You guys change your mind fast, huh?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry to interrupt you when you're working, but I'm seeing enemies! Be careful!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Enemy signals detected!  
They seem...different than normal enemies!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Don't worry. In terms of strength, they're no different than regular enemies.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
&ndash;Let's do it!  
  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Now I'm seeing a Servant!  
It's close!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Thanks, Doctor!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Hmm?  
No, what is this?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's a Servant... But it looks a little crude.  
Like parts of it are patched together.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Crude?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A Shadow Servant is literally a fake&mdash;a shadow modeled after a Heroic Spirit's Spirit Origin.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is just “something very similar.” It's a well-made Spirit Origin down to the details, but...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Should we call it a counterfeit?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes. That's exactly right.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...That explains it. No wonder something didn't feel right.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
In other words, you're not exactly a pure Servant.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Alexander the Great...  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Yes, that's right!  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
We are counterfeit Heroic Spirits. We're Servants, yet we are neither pure Servants nor pure heroes.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Go easy on me, okay♡  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So beautiful... His smile is so beautiful!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The spitting image of an enchanting young boy.  
Any opinions as an artist?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
&ndash;I'm in love. I'd like to draw his naked body.  
No, I want to get naked and draw him!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...I see. Do it in a dimensional rift so you don't bother anyone.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Okay, Alexander.  
Tell us who made you and what your goal is.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I won't hurt you. I may not look it, but I'm a man who understands counterfeits.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
You're lying, mister!  
You're going to hurt me, I know it!  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Once you get the information you'll kill me in a heartbeat, won't you?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
What kind of barbarian do you think I am?  
I'll capture you, but after that, it's up to you.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
For one thing, your body is...  
No, I won't say it. I'm sure you're well aware.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Yup. No need to bring that up.  
I don't worry about that kind of stuff at all.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
What's required from me now is innocence and purity. That's what will bring her peace.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
On the other hand, that also means all she wanted was my abilities, without any unnecessary elements.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
But I guess that's fun in its own way.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
“She”?  
Who can that be...  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Too bad! That's a secret!  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
I mean, right now I am “a talented little stepbrother who adores the big sister living with him!”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh?  
I'm sorry, what?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Heheh! It's so romantic, isn't it?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
To be honest, I didn't quite get that backstory either, but it's a very girly wish!  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Come on, [♂ mister /♀ lady]♡  
It's time for war!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
That intensity. Those words. Even if you are a counterfeit, you are the man who'll someday become the King of Conquerors.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Very well.  
Let's fight him, Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Roger!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Alexander:**   
Hmm... I guess that's it, then.  
Hahaha! I figured it would be hard to actually win.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
To get so close and still be so far...  
That's what is sad about being a fake, isn't it?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
That's not true. It was a fight between Servants,  
and you lost. That's all.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
&mdash;As expected.  
Real Heroic Spirits are always so amazing, huh?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
&mdash;  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, how I enjoyed that... A young man, his trained biceps pushed to the limit... Wonderful!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Da Vinci's being weird...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Look. She may be real, but look at her. It's fine to worry about where you came from, but stupid to compare it.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Whatever. Thanks for the nice speech.  
In exchange, I'll tell you what you want to know, I guess.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
But all I can really tell you is your next destination.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
There are counterfeit workshops all over the place.  
They're spreading fakes of Da Vinci's works little by little.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
But I don't know what her goal is,  
not in the slightest!  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Why? Because my job's to be innocent! I haven't been told anything about what goes on behind the scenes.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
I mean, it's not that hard to figure out.  
But it would be rude to tell.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Roger.  
I see you're not going to talk no matter what.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
We're in a hurry...but do you need me to finish you off?  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Hmm, nope, I guess.  
I hate sympathy.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
I don't... Neither does she. I'm a fake, so I'll just disappear when my expiration date arrives.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Master, um...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sadder than you thought?  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, yes!  
I really don't know what to feel!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is this supposed to be serious?  
   
**Emiya:**   
A bit, yeah.  
A king once said...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
“Don't give objects hearts.”  
Perhaps that was his way of being kind.  
  
   
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Okay, all done!  
Pretty boys are the best!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Like a fairy that's all exterior and no interior,  
elegantly flitting about the world!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, how I hope that it can express even half of his beauty!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't think Da Vinci is going to be able to help us with much, Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Emiyan is our only help!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Leave it to me!  
I never have big successes, but I always get the job done.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Anyway... I'm not sure I like the name Emiyan!  
  
   
## Section 2: Counterfeit "Mr. Dandy"  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So this is our next stop... Isn't it a bit cold?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
We are in the north after all. Are you okay, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just fine.  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
An outdoors type, huh.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
My reindeer experience is helping.  
   
**Emiya:**   
I see... Your reindeer experience... Reindeer?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Reindeer... Santa... Storm... Drifting... Death Concert...  
Help me Death Concert Okeanos... M-My head!  
  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm. I'm seeing enemies.  
Looks like they're trying to surround you.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Ahem!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Let's break through. We'll hit the enemies where their number is few. Is everyone ready?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Let's go!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey Roman.  
Analyze this homunculus for me, would you?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You always make me do everything, don't you...  
Fine, I'll do it.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I see. This one's different, too.  
It's similar to a homunculus, but different.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Another counterfeit, huh...  
All right, let's get moving.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Now that we've confirmed this homunculus is a counterfeit, we know we're heading in the right direction.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Oh, there you are!  
Hey, original Heroic Spirits!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Does that mean you're another counterfeit?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You too, Hektor&ndash;  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Well, Servants are basically counterfeits to begin with. So it would make me happy if you would just let me go.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
That's not possible.  
You're still spreading the counterfeits.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Are heroes of justice always this stubborn?  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
How about it, Master?  
I think you're likely to be a bit more flexible.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Tell me what your goal is.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
My goal? My goal, huh... Well, if I really have to say, it's to pat her head.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I don't understand what you're talking about!  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
My job is to spoil her.  
The role of Hektor is&ndash;  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
“A friendly, free-spirited older man who's back from overseas, who may or may not be related by blood!”  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Too long!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
W-Wow. Wait, where's the “overseas” part coming from?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Stop it. Delving into vague backstories is a good way to get burned.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Basically, she wants someone who cares. Someone gentle and sweet, who does whatever she says.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
First Alexander, now this... Seems their Master must be a bit of a spoiled child.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
A spoiled child, huh? But isn't that kind of what makes her adorable?  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
When a spoiled child is demanding, it means they're testing your trust. And they're doing that because they're scared.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Isn't that kind of cute?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm. So a dandy-type Heroic Spirit who spoils you, huh... It works!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It does not.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That aside, these particular counterfeits are unforgivable!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Look at these Mona Lisas here that just got finished!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
What I hate isn't the skill, it's the passion!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Skill-wise, it's still just an inferior copy, but the passion is real. But she's not trying to imitate me!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Instead of putting in the passion to imitate me,  
she's starting to put it towards surpassing me!  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Oh, so you noticed, huh?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Her skills are a little inferior, but when mixed with her passion, they make it seem like the real thing.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It's the type of counterfeits that you can't just ignore. &ndash;I assume you're ready, Hektor?  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Right, right. I figured this was coming. Well, that's fine.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
I may be a counterfeit, but I'll give it my all!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Hektor:**   
Tch... Fine, I lost.  
I guess this is as far as a counterfeit can go.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
No, Hektor.  
You didn't lose because you're a counterfeit.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You lost because you're weak.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Wow, aren't you harsh!?  
But well, that makes me feel better.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
All right, next time I challenge you I'll be stronger.  
See ya!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Heh. He may joke around, but his spear was sharp and struck hard. Carelessness could have meant our end.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The way he talks is an important part of his defenses.  
That's why the great hero Achilles kept his distance.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
A passionate counterfeit...  
One that seeks to surpass the original...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Well, that's what happens if you do it for a while.  
Most counterfeiters eventually end up like that.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
They stop making copies, and even trying to become like the original. They try to surpass them.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I'm not sure who their Master is, but I'm sure her feelings are real.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Da Vinci, is there anything else you can learn from those counterfeits?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm...  
...(lick)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She licked it!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
From the taste of the paint...  
We should go to the beach next, maybe?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The beach!?  
  
   
## Section 3: Counterfeit "The Humble Yet Powerful Dragon Slayer"  
   
**Mash:**   
What does the beach have to do with that paint?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I tasted calcium carbonate.  
Maybe they made some of the paint from shells?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So we're here at the beach! Now, who's that fake Servant behind door number three!?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That sorry-looking fella right there is&mdash;  
Siegfried?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Wait, Mash! Don't get close to him! He's a counterfeit!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But that's Siegfried!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He's the humblest, meekest, and most polite Saber in the entire world!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Even if he's a counterfeit Heroic Spirit, that shouldn't change.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
That's right. I am very sorry that we have to fight...  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
NOT!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What did you say!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No way... NO WAY!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foooou!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Fujimaru and Fou are freaking out!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I'm surprised too!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
What's wrong, Siegfried!  
This isn't like you at all!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I can't help it. I'm a counterfeit after all. If the original is humble, I must surpass it with my pride to defeat my opponents.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
For one thing, isn't it rude to tell someone you're sorry when you're not?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
He's right. A very arrogant comment, but he's right!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
He's a counterfeit trying to surpass the original, but he's still kind of humble at his core!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I think that's just who Siegfried is!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
&mdash;I am the strongest dragon, descending on a beach beneath the crescent moon. I have nothing to apologize for.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Instead, be bold. Be bolder&mdash;  
That's what she whispers to me.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
She, huh? Hmm, and it's not like she has something against me, right?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Or actually, I don't think she does. If she hated me, she'd be a little more clingy, or sticky&ndash;  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yes. It's best to say that she's dry.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
A dried-up fresco. It lasts for a century,  
but will never change.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...That's why you're the most famous artist in the world. You're very perceptive. I commend you for that.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
But that doesn't mean I can tell you anything. I'm sor...  
No, you're my enemy, so I'm not sorry at all.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Kindness towards an enemy can only be shown if you have the strength to spare it, and I do not.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Now let's fight, Fujimaru! I've got no real reason to, but I'll stop you with everything I've got!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Gah! I'm so...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Gotcha!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...Sorry! I messed up!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He was a tough opponent, but we won, Master!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...No, I am the one who won.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
What?  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I tricked you, but I won't apologize!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Because it's only natural for a warrior to try and trick his foe.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
It's nothing to be ashamed of.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
He said that with such confidence!  
Like “What are you going to do!?”  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
&mdash;Oh no! This is bad, Mash!  
Activate your Noble Phantasm now!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
&mdash;I am the bone of my sword.  
  
   
## Section 4: Counterfeit "The Cool Guys of Arts and Science"  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...That's it for them.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I never thought you and I would team up.  
Highly unlikely, even for our originals!  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...It's for her sake. We have no choice.  
Also, I would never want to pair up with “that.”  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Hmm... I agree.  
Quite vexing.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
First of all, the fact that it is impossible to communicate is quite a problem.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
It's not that she can't perceive data from the five senses, it's that she doesn't.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
It's not that she's blind or deaf, it's that she doesn't try to see or listen.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
The trouble is that she possesses top-class abilities.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Well, never mind her.  
&ndash;It looks like they are still alive.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I don't think either of us held back.  
...Should we have used our Noble Phantasms?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
It's not just that Demi-Servant, Mash! Even that mysterious Archer has a shield-type Noble Phantasm!  
  
   
**Arash:**   
It appears we underestimated them.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Siegfried's loss is unfortunate.  
...I am sorry we dragged him into this.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
No. Precisely because he was defenseless, we were able to lure them into this trap. He would've wanted this.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...I guess that's it for me.  
I leave the rest to you!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I can't believe this. He may be a counterfeit, but to think they would use the great hero Siegfried as bait...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash, are you okay!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes, somehow!  
I deployed my Noble Phantasm just in time...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, that was close...  
You're a jack-of-all-trades, aren't you?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
A bowman has many talents.  
...And so do our opponents, it would seem.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Careful, Master.  
I know who they are.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
One is Arash, a great hero of ancient Persia.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The other is the gifted hero Arjuna,  
a legend in India's epic poem the Mahabharata.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Even if they're counterfeit Heroic Spirits,  
they are far more powerful than us.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Arash and Arjuna. Both were Heroic Spirits who lived during the Age of the Gods.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
They're going to attack.  
Don't hesitate, Master.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
&ndash;Even after sacrificing Siegfried, we dealt them almost no damage.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Nameless Hero. I do not know who you are, but I respect your ability.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Your strategic error was to try to kill us without using your Noble Phantasms.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Of course&ndash;Arjuna aside, it's not like Arash can use his Noble Phantasm here.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Hmm, this is quite vexing.  
Very vexing.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
If I used my Noble Phantasm,  
I would make that child so sad!  
  
   
**Arash:**   
She gets carried away. When she only means to curse at someone, she spits at them too.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Then she's filled with self-loathing when she realizes that she's made the same mistake again.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
She may be our Master, but she is quite simple in principle. That's how she will act.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Quite undesirable, really.  
...I'm the only one who should make her weep.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Counterfeits... “Her”... Hmm.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey, you two.  
Can I ask a question?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Oh, and what would that be?  
I don't mind answering if it's something I know.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'd like you to tell me about the relationship between you and your Master.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
If my speculation is correct,  
both of you were assigned a role, yes?  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...You're quite perceptive.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
What was your role again? She was using some kind of slang, like “tsun” or “sadistic” or something like that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Tsun... Sadistic?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Slang... I think that means...  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I shall explain my role once and only once.  
I am&ndash;  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
“a very sadistic science major upperclassman who gets all lovey-dovey when it matters most.”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sadistic&ndash;!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Who gets all lovey-dovey when it matters most&ndash;!?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Upperclassman... Science major?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe it's the white coat...  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Such a simplistic thought process...is quite plausible...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Ah...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That makes so much sense!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
So... What about you, Arash?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Oh me? I hope you'll find mine surprising and amusing!  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I am the “older childhood friend who's an humanities major and lives next door!”  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Older childhood friend&ndash;!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Humanities major&ndash;!?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
And lives next door&ndash;!?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
While we're on the topic, Siegfried was “the friendly class celebrity who, by coincidence, sits next to you in class.”  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Class celebrity!?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...That's enough.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
At any rate, both of you were born as counterfeit Heroic Spirits and assigned specific roles.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Alexander, Hektor, Siegfried,  
Arjuna, and Arash.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Each of you consoled your Master in your own way, showering her with affection.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
So that's why you were summoned?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
However, whether it's for money or some other objective, your Master has been pirating my works.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Hmm... You're a bit off the mark.  
But close enough, I suppose.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Arash. Isn't this the time to pretend like you know a little less?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
It's no big deal. We've done what we're supposed to.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
The moment our Master began to forge counterfeits,  
she was no doubt aware how it would all turn out.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I don't quite agree.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Whether Chaldea wants to track down the counterfeits or not, their priority right now should be restoring the Foundation of Humanity.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
It's unnecessary to solve an issue that wouldn't even turn into a Singularity. In that case... You there, that Master! Won't you make a deal with me?  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
It's clear that we're stronger.  
If you withdraw now, we won't attack you.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I think it's a fair deal myself.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Master.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Fujimaru, it's you who must decide.  
We will obey your decision.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Hmm, I guess this is it. It bothers me that so many counterfeits are being circulated...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But it doesn't make any sense to put Fujimaru at risk.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I agree.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm sad that my works will remain obscure...  
But, I guess it can't be helped!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I mean, humanity is at stake here. If there are no human beings left to appreciate my art, what's the point?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Art is only a visual depiction of this world's phenomena and truths that are already beautiful as they are.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But art is how I make my living. It is the reason for my existence. I was born for art.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So, ultimately, as long as no one interferes with my artistic work, I am content.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
If anyone loudly condemns my work to be a sham, I can proudly claim otherwise.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I can say, “I am the one who created this work!”  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Da Vinci...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Romani, sorry to be so selfish.  
Prepare to Rayshift.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay. Well, I'd expect no less of a conclusion from you, Leonardo.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait a second!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Hmm?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Oh.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't Rayshift!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
What...w-why!? I told you I'm fine.  
I can create new works of art.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I want to see Da Vinci's real works.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...You heard that, Da Vinci.  
Our Master can be quite reckless.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's just how Senpai is!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Either way, I'm not that weak to a point of asking my enemies for mercy. Arash, Arjuna... Ready your bows.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Hah hah hah! Your Master is quite bold. I wish we could provide you with some of our Master's sensitivity.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
&ndash;But...a battle is a battle.  
We won't hold back.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
So you don't need mercy from us, huh? Such an endearing fool, but&ndash;you've made a grave mistake.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
My name is Arjuna.  
With this arrow, you will all scatter like a flower's petals!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Arash:**   
Ah dammit. I lost...  
I didn't think I pulled any punches but...  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
So a counterfeit's utmost effort wasn't enough to defeat an original, huh... No...authenticity isn't the problem here.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
We lost to you.  
And that is all...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I suppose we don't have to run around the world anymore. She's at an art museum, right?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Oh, I'm not about to confess to that!  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Arash is right. You should find that out yourself.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Leonardo da Vinci. History's greatest artist, known worldwide for your works.  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Right. I don't want you to meet her.  
However, if you do happen to run into her...  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Witness the truth with your own eyes.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
We've come this far.  
All that's left is to go meet the boss&ndash;  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Will you come with me?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I see.  
One more thing.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Thanks...for what you did earlier.  
Hah, it's kind of awkward to directly thank someone.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I can't believe I'm seeing this...  
Da Vinci...seems...to be...embarrassed!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, do not ruin a nice moment. Please shut up.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Anyway, you agreed.  
You'll see this through with me to the end, right?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...It seems my role this time is to ascertain the authenticity of her works.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
By the way, Da Vinci.  
You mentioned an “art museum.” Which one, exactly?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, come on. Surely you know where my Mona Lisa was originally on display, right?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The Louvre!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
If she's not there...  
Then I'll give up without complaint!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But for now, let's search thoroughly...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
## Section 5: Counterfeit "The Father Troubled Over His Rebellious Daughter"  
   
**Mash:**   
So this is the Louvre...  
Senpai, if we have some time to spare later...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's walk around a bit.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
A stroll through a museum? How laid-back, Master.  
...Well, don't worry about it.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
If you have the time, it'd be good for you to enjoy the art here.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
However, nothing on display here is authentic. Although you should still be able to enjoy them since they're well-made duplicates.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's a date, of course!  
   
**Mash:**   
D...  
Da...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Umm, I do not know if I will meet your standards,  
but I shall do my best for the occasion!  
  
   
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well then...  
Roman, are there any Servants?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Scan complete.  
The counterfeits are definitely there.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If you continue going straight, be careful.  
You'll probably encounter enemies.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Okay.  
Let's get started, shall we?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes!  
Master, your orders please!  
  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...A counterfeit Heroic Spirit is coming!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Ugh... This malicious aura...  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
&ndash;Oh, now that's a familiar face.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Gilles de Rais!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yes, I'm not surprised...  
As long as she's there, he'll be with her.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
What are you babbling about!  
My name is Gilles de Rais!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
I am “a sad father who was loved by his daughter when she was a kid, but is now hated by her since she became a rebellious teenager!”  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
I am Gilles de Rais, who gets shooed away with comments like “Dad, you smell like an old person!”  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How tragic...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oh... Yeah, I know where she's coming from though.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you for your vivid description!  
I deeply sympathize!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Thank you, sweet young lady!  
Oh, if only my daughter had your kindness!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
But so it goes. This is also fate... If this is the stage that child envisioned, I must resign myself to that fact.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...I don't think she had any intention of sharing that information with others...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Enough. Gilles de Rais, we have nothing to ask of you.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
If you stand in our way,  
we will cut you down.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Oh, is that right?  
Hooooooowever!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Finally, I have a question for you, Master.  
Why do you interfere with us!?  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
If Leonardo da Vinci's counterfeits are a problem,  
we'll persuade that child to forge someone else's works.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
I beg you!  
Please don't interfere with us!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We have to meet her.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Right.  
Marshal Gilles de Rais.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
We know her identity.  
We simply want to understand her motive.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, it's possible that we already have a rough idea, but...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
To go into bouts of fury, despair, and contempt by merely imagining others' motives...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I can't give my approval.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Agreed.  
In any case, we cannot avoid a fight.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Whatever her purpose is,  
it doesn't change the fact that she opposes us.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
No matter how touching her wish is,  
we must first defeat her if we are to reason with her.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
...I see. In that case, we shall be your opponents.  
For that child's dreams and wishes.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
We seven Servants were created to fulfill them after all.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Let the counterfeits surpass their originals!  
Let falsity overpower truth!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Even if we're branded as spurious, false, or specious,  
we still exist now, in this place!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Gilles:**   
Heh... Sorry, but she's all right.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
She is not a lonely girl who had faith foisted on her and was forced into seclusion.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
She is not a warrior who continues forward, even while bearing wounds that won't heal. She is not a moralizing saint.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
No miracle will happen, no revelation.  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
Even though she was just a counterfeit... She's trying to spread her wings out in the world as an individual!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
I dream of the eventual day when we shall meet again somewhere far away. Farewell...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Then all that's left are her and one more.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We know who she is.  
It's the other one that's the problem.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
If I had to guess, I would say someone like Karna.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Kojirou Sasaki is also a possibility.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wh-What about Leonidas?  
You know, the protect-with-all-his-might type!  
  
   
**Both:**   
Nope, nope, nope.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Really?  
Master, who do you think?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
E. Teach.  
   
**Mash:**   
E. Teach?  
...Um, remind me who that is again.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Blackbeard. Edward Teach, huh?  
I see. That makes sense...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
No, wait.  
It can't be. There's no way.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ohh, Blackbeard? Hm...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's impossible, Master!  
U-Um, did you receive a blow to the head!?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe Amadeus?  
   
**Emiya:**   
Mozart, huh? Well, he does have good facial features...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
But if he opened his mouth, it'd be no good.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, listen. If he were the “Silent Musician” type and did nothing, there would be no problem.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see! As long as he kept his mouth shut, there'd be no problem!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You guys are really being mean!  
  
   
  
   
## Section 6: Counterfeit "The Valkyrie Moving Towards The Day After Tomorrow"  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Quiet.  
I heard voices.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It seems she hasn't noticed us. Since she's a counterfeit,  
she's probably weaker at detecting Servants.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...We might have a chance to ambush her.  
Let's move in slowly.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Oh I'm sick of this! How!?  
How did you end up like this!?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Ahhh, I'm so happy... To think... To think you would care about me this much!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Enough!  
Get off of me!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
(We go on 3, 2, 1.)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Got it.)  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
(3, 2&ndash;)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(1!)  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Don't move!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Just get away from...me...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Oh, oh... My love! My Sigurd!  
Please, please yell at me some more!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
...  
...

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Pretend we didn't see anything?  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I would appreciate it if you did!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The final battle!  
   
**Emiya:**   
Wait, Master! It's hard to switch into battle mode after witnessing that!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Yes, you're right.  
Let's try to talk it out first.  
  
   
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hmph. I'm surprised you made it this far.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I suppose you picked up the limited traces left behind by the counterfeits and they led you here.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Hahhh... Hahhh...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um, at your feet...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Ta gueule!  
...Hiyah!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
She flew out into the distance...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
She really put everything behind that kick.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-All right, let's get back on track.  
...Hm? I'm sorry. What's that sound?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Don't tell me.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
!!!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Brynhild is crawling back here like a scene from a horror movie!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Eeeeeek!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Hey, calm down, Brynhild!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Aren't you supposed to be the type that whispers in a beautiful melancholic voice and charges forward!?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
What would your Loved One think if he saw you like this!?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
&ndash;What are you talking about?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Eep.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Pardon me for that weird sound.  
Seeing her up close sure is impactful.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
She's the only one I love...  
I accept her love with all of my body.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
What is wrong with that?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...You heard her.  
So was your kick an expression of love?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Of course not! Not even close!  
Dammit, why is this happening to me!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
All I did was make a simple wish: “Among my seven followers, it would be nice to have a woman.”  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
How did that get twisted into me getting a woman straight out of horror movies calling me “Big Sister” instead of Master!?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Love... It's love... Everything is love... Hahhhh...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I told you! I AM NOT! LOOKING! FOR THAT KIND OF LOVE!  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Ahhh, this pain...this impact... It sends a tingling sensation down my spine! I see, love can be painful!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Well, that has some truth in it.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&ndash;Sigh...  
Fine, please ignore this for now.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Hahh... Hahh... Hahh...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I will do that...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hmph.  
I figured you would sniff me out.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
But you came faster than I expected. As always, that nose of yours works like a dog, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We haven't seen you since Orleans, eh, Jeanne Alter?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...I thought you were gone for good.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&ndash;Ha!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
It doesn't matter how twisted my birth was.  
Once I exist as a concept, it's impossible to get rid of me.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...True. Even if something born into this world gets destroyed and disappears...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The fact that it was born will never be erased.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
As expected, Faker.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
However, that alone shouldn't be enough.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Gilles de Rais wished for your existence and the Holy Grail made it happen.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The Holy Grail was recovered and Gilles de Rais was defeated. There was almost zero possibility that you could be summoned again.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Ahahahaha! Yes, you're right, you're absolutely right! The possibility of me being summoned again was infinitesimal.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
After all, nobody wanted me!  
The one hero who wished for me was dead!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Except for him, I ruled by brute force,  
so no one wanted me brought back!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&ndash;So I inverted the idea.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
The one woman who would never wish for me, the other half of me whom I hate and despise...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I managed to flip that idiot's wish inside-out, and somehow that's how I was reborn.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
So forceful... It's like a fictional villain materializing into reality.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It's a rule-breaking technique made possible by the fact that the Heroic Spirit Jeanne d'Arc is unbelievably popular.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Yes, I accept that. I am without a doubt a counterfeit. An abysmal possibility born out of her mercy.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
But this world is full of lies. The world approves of the existence of counterfeits. No one says “a counterfeit must not surpass the original!”  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Alter... You're dissatisfied as a counterfeit, and want to surpass the original?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That's right. I won't repeat the same mistake made in Orleans.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
At the time, I was no more than a machine, made to reject her.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I'm a counterfeit&ndash; So what!? Want me to hide in the shadows? HAH! Like I would ever do that!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Even if I'm a counterfeit, there are no rules saying I can't make a name for myself in this world!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I am Jeanne d'Arc.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Many people imagined that a death like mine warranted vengeance. I'm a witch who fell on account of that.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I am, beyond a shred of doubt,  
one aspect of Jeanne d'Arc!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I am an Anti-Hero born from the dark abyss of murderous intent and hatred... An Avenger-class Servant!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Avenger, you say?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She's right. She doesn't fit into any of the seven classes... She's also different than Jeanne's Ruler class!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Get up now, you pervert!  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Yes! Hahh, hahh, hahh... I've had my fill...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
And now, I am going to kill you.  
Prepare yourselves.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
This spear will not overlook the fact that you're Big Sister's enemy... Oh, it's also good for giving her acupuncture.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I'll never let you give me a massage again!  
Look! Look what you did to me!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
That's... Hm. I was going to keep my mouth shut, but let me correct you.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Listen, Holy Maiden of Vengeance.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Wh-What do you want?  
Talking like that, you must be a womanizer.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Hahaha. All right, now I won't hold anything back.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
You summoned seven counterfeit Heroic Spirits.  
No, you made them.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
That was revenge for Orleans, yes?  
But this time, your wishes are mixed in there.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Why are most of the counterfeit Heroic Spirits handsome men? Why didn't you rely on your general, Gilles?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
The answer is clear. You just haven't realized it yourself. Deep inside that consciousness is a desire to be the protagonist!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Nonsense! If that's the case, how do you explain this perverted woman!?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
What... Perverted? What a passionate comment... (Blush)  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Die of dehydration!  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Aaah! Love is painfully hot!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um... Even I understand.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sure you just wanted “an honest friend who's the same sex as you” right?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&mdash;!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Annoying.  
You people are truly annoying.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I am a lone Avenger. The counterfeits are only pawns. If I don't like them, I will crush them without a second thought.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Come at me. I will show you even a counterfeit can surpass the original!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Here she comes. Your orders, please, Master!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Emiya:**   
Somehow we managed to take down Brynhild, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right. Jeanne Alter is still a threat!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
We just need one more push.  
You can do it, Master!  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...I failed. Master, sorry I couldn't be of use to you...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Don't worry about it.  
I could tell from watching your struggle up close.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Your lack of ability is my responsibility.  
I wasn't able to summon you into a proper form.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Why don't you blame me before you die, like the others?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Well, heh-heh.  
You still don't get it, do you, Master?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
&ndash;I enjoyed myself.  
I had so much fun.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
We're counterfeit Heroic Spirits. We've been able to indulge in the vice, masochism, and folly that our true personalities never could.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Thanks to you, Master, I've had a ridiculously good time.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
You gave us so much pleasure.  
Why would we blame you?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
The emotions you gave us, the fictional backstory... they're no more than a starting point.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
We began there,  
and fell in love with you along the way.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
It pains me to say it, but this is the end for me.  
Goodbye, Big Sister&ndash;  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So one left, huh?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Fujimaru, how do you think we should solve this commotion?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Think about that.  
  
   
## Final Section: Counterfeit "The Avenger Who Turned Her Back on Original Works"  
   
**Brynhild:**   
It pains me to say it, but this is the end for me.  
Goodbye, Big Sister&ndash;  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...  
Humph. What a joke.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
It sounded to me like she was being honest.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
It's a joke. I created the seven counterfeit Heroic Spirits as pawns for my amusement.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
They have no respect, affection, or trust.  
After all, we came into this world as fakes.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Sigh. Even with your back against the wall,  
you haven't realized your true feelings. Unbelievable.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Dark Jeanne d'Arc. Let's set aside counterfeit paintings and sculptures.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
As far as counterfeit Heroic Spirits go, you're on the right track. You said your goal was to surpass the original...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...but you've already created counterfeits that surpass the originals.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
After all, the originals are bound by their sense of heroism. Fujimaru, don't you agree?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They all looked like they were having a good time.  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
What are you talking about, “a good time?”  
Don't make me laugh. It couldn't have been fun.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
None of them complained.  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Ridiculous. What are you saying?  
They must have felt bitter.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I summoned them by force, but wasn't satisfied,  
so I even altered their parameters.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
They may have acted as my subordinates on the surface, but must have despised me on the inside!  
  
   
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Listen, I'm Leonardo da Vinci,  
creator of many original works.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Do you think I can't tell whether something is genuine or fake? They sincerely enjoyed themselves.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well more than the original Servants at that.  
They had concern for and deeply cared about you.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
What Fujimaru said is important, too.  
This is a Master who has been through many scenes of bloodshed.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
[♂ He /♀ She] said it best. There was nothing false about those counterfeit Heroic Spirits.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Look, even if you don't believe me,  
you can believe Fujimaru, can't you?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...I don't know. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know!  
I don't understand any of this!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I mean... There's nothing lovable about me!  
I have no charm! I'm a helplessly twisted little girl!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
All I have is power, so much so you want to throw up! But can you blame me!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That's all I have! I'm driven to seek revenge and it's all that I have!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
&ndash;Yes. That's okay, isn't it?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Whether you're lovable or charming or worthy of being a Servant...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You've given a lot of thought to those things, but your conclusion is confusing.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Since long ago, you've understood.  
You're a girl who burns with vengeance.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You should have gone big with that wicked power of yours. You should have become an Anti-Hero.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And then you should've been summoned here like that, as a Servant.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Humph. After all this time, I wouldn't have the nerve&ndash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I would welcome you.  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Think about it, you half-wit!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Welcome to Chaldea!  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Don't you need any processing time?  
Are you a calculator?  
  
   
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Whether you're a Heroic Spirit or an Anti-Hero, Fujimaru is the perfect five-star Master.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So, what are you going to do?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...  
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...  
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...  
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...It's my loss.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
You admit defeat?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I will admit my defeat, with one exception.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I admit to an inferiority complex over that Holy Maiden.  
I admit to a craving to be sought after.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I admit to having smoldering hatred in my heart even now.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
And I admit that no matter how much success I achieve, how many lives I save&mdash; I'll always be an Avenger who is never satisfied.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
But even so, with all the sins this hopeless Avenger has committed,  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
if you still wish for this strength, this flag of hatred, I will respond to your summon, last Master of the world.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master... You did it!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then let's go ho&ndash;  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Now, let's begin our final battle to the death!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
H-Huh!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
What? Demi-Servant, why are you looking at me with wide eyes? We're going to fight.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? But...  
Didn't you just surrender!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&ndash;No, I did no such thing. Don't tell me you thought I would just go off to Chaldea with you?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I did. Or at least I don't think a duel to the death is necessary.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
It is. After all, you people defeated my pawns.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
As the one who stands above all counterfeit Heroic Spirits, I will never back down from a fight. I will fight with all my strength. That's nonnegotiable.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
After all&mdash; I'm an exceptionally wicked Heroic Spirit. You think I'd let someone who defied me get away so easily?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Sheesh. Just what we need.  
Somebody with pride in being an evil leader.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Only one thing to do.  
Give up and fight, Master.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
But look at the bright side.  
This will be our last fight with her.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Fujimaru.  
I mean Master.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm sure you already realize this.  
She needs this fight more than anyone.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
If we blew it off here, she would have a lifelong grudge against you.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I mean... Put it this way. Scary as she is, you would hate for that to happen, right?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Get ready to fight!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Oui.  
Yes, that's it. That impudent expression!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
How many times did I want to make you kneel in Orleans?! How many times did I want to trample you!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&ndash;It's time to hit the dirt, originals!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!!!  
Here come the remaining enemies too!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mash Kyrielight, ready for combat!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Ahhh, that wasn't enough, huh?  
But that's okay.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
It was fun, just like that horror movie woman said.  
I had a lot of fun!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That's why this story and I shall end here.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Ahhh, this is so vexing!  
But that's fine.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
The future me will form a bond with you. The current me will have a hearty laugh and go off into the sunset.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I'm sure the future me won't have any memories of being a counterfeit Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
So the current me at least wanted to make one last memory&ndash; So I wouldn't be lonely.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...I guess it's about time.  
Good. You've embarrassed me enough.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You'd better take full responsibility...  
Goodbye.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master. We've recovered a fragment of the Holy Grail.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Just as Elisabeth retrieved a Holy Grail fragment back in Orleans...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...it seems Jeanne Alter also obtained a fragment from somewhere.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Her elimination is confirmed.  
Now there's no more danger of counterfeit proliferation.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good work. You can come back now. Although you could also retrieve the remaining counterfeits.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Master, you were right. Sometimes there are people who just need to be defeated.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
There are people who can't admit defeat and move on until it's too late.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
She had to be defeated precisely because she has gained the qualification to be summoned as a Servant.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yes, that's right. There are people in this world who need to be defeated before they can move forward.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, shall we go home? For a shut-in like me, the turmoil this time was a lot to bear!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I think you should get some exercise once in a while, Da Vinci, instead of tinkering with your strange inventions all the time.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Huh? I use an exercise bike in my room so I don't particularly need more exercise than this.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Why, I got a clear understanding of just how athletic you are. To think you were good at close combat...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
As soon as we get back, King Leonidas and I will come up with a training menu to make you fit enough to stand on the front line.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I don't want a total muscle-building menu!  
If I get muscles, I'll lose this golden ratio!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Don't worry. A little training and we'll send you to the front. I bet you're looking forward to that day, Master.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
I can't wait to have her on the team.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A bulked-up Da Vinci!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You can forget about that idea!  
I'm not ready to go anywhere!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Unless something dire happens, I'm not going to the front! Keep that in miiiiiiind!
