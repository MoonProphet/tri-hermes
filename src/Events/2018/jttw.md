# Sanzang Coming to the West  
  
## Prologue: "Five Elements Mountain: The Buddha's Apprentice"  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, what is that?  
...A roll of paper?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes. It's an ancient manuscript, like an old book.  
We call it a scroll.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, how I love the smell of old books.  
They really have luster. (Sniff Sniff)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah... So that's your fetish, is it...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Excuse me. My questions were an invasion of privacy. From now on, I promise to ignore what I see.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, I'm not some kind of bibliomaniac, okay!?  
I was asked to bring it from the warehouse, so I did.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This was an item brought into Chaldea and kept there because it was thought to be a precious artifact affiliated with a certain person.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That means it is a catalyst for summoning. You said you were asked. So, was it for some kind of experiment?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, this was an unreasonable favor from a certain painter at the workshop&mdash; Oh hi, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning, Senpai.  
...You're dressed a bit flashy, aren't you?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The party is here, right?  
   
**Mash:**   
Party? ...Here?  
I don't think any have been planned...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You were probably given the wrong information.  
...Let's interrogate Caesar later.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
In that case, what kind of smell do you like, Mash?  
   
**Mash:**   
Which part of the conversation did you hear!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let me see... Although I am still young and inexperienced, there are still smells I love, or I want to fall in love with.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The smell of soil, the smell of green pastures, the smell of fresh-baked bread. Fou, you smell a little like sunshine.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And, well, when I'm in your room, Senpai...sometimes...  
I feel dizzy...  
  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmmm? I'm sorry for interrupting your conversation, but something is off. Somehow the system started by itself...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...? I assumed that you were making preparations for a summoning. But you're right, something is strange&mdash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This setup is completely backwards&mdash; Leonardo! What kind of joke are you trying to pull off!? Stop the experiment now!  
  
   
**Announcement:**   
Unsummon Program, start. Due to an exception in processing, Coffin support is refused.  
  
   
**Announcement:**   
Spiritron Conversion, start. Rayshift starts in 6, 5, 4...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Get away from there, Mash!  
You too, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, please come over here! It's dangerous!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's weird, Mash! For some reason, I can't move!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You really should have a good talk with Da Vinci sometime.  
   
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...  
   
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Where am I?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm stuck...between these rocks... I can't move!  
   
  
   
**A：???:**  
Looks like you've regained consciousness.  
Are you okay?  
  
   
**A：???:**  
Where is this, you ask? This place is north of Loulan, west of Hami. It lies at the border between the Great Tang Empire's realm and Gaochang.  
  
   
**A：???:**  
We are at the foot of the Five Elements Mountain, where the peaks seem to be able to reach heaven. And you are under some heavy-looking rocks.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? Under the rocks!? Help me!  
   
**A：???:**  
Of course, I'll help you right away! ...But you seem surprisingly okay? Oops, spoke too soon... Why is your face turning pale?  
  
   
**A：???:**  
Oh. Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to tease you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is this some sort of kinky play?  
   
**A：???:**  
Huh? ...Well, with composure like that, you're obviously no ordinary person. Still, you don't look like a demon to me either.  
  
   
**A：???:**  
...Yes! I need to make up my mind!  
  
   
  
   
**A：???:**  
I'm certain that you must be the one that I've been looking for. The Buddha must have brought us together!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
My name is Xuanzang Sanzang.  
&mdash;What about you?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm a Master from Chaldea Security Organization.  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Chaldea? Master? Hmmm...  
And you say your name is Fujimaru?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yo, I'm !  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I love energetic disciples!  
...Oops, you're not my disciple yet.  
  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Okay, Fujimaru. First, let me get you out of there. Behold the blessing of the Buddha!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
aryavalokitesvaro bodhisattvo gambhirayam prajnaparamitayam caryam caramano vyavalokayati...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...Are you okay? Did you get hurt?  
Do you want me to get you some bandages?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm perfectly fine.  
   
**Sanzang:**   
&mdash;I see. I'm so glad! So?  
I bet you see me in a different light now, right?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Everything is a bit foggy right now...  
   
**Sanzang:**   
That's concerning.  
Okay, let's take a little break!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I'm sure you'll feel better while we talk.  
Speaking of which, it's time for my preaching!  
  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
All right! Now, let's start over.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Let me introduce myself. I'm Xuanzang Sanzang. Despite how I look, I'm a monk. A proper monk that follows the teachings of the Buddha.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I'm currently in the middle of a journey to the far western land, Tianzhu, under the decree of the emperor of the Tang Dynasty. As for my mission... Ummm...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
To get the precious scriptures?  
   
**Sanzang:**   
What, how do you know? Oh no, I guess I was showing too much of my virtuousness...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
&mdash;That's right, just like you've said!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
To collect...seven...dragon orbs?  
   
**Sanzang:**   
You mean to materialize the wish granter that could fulfill any wish by offering the blood of those seeking it?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Too bad, I won't be swayed by such an easy temptation. But, you're on the right track&mdash; Yes, I am collecting something.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
As for what I'm collecting...  
  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Scriptures! I have a duty to collect scriptures! Scriptures that can be found on the way to Tianzhu! But...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
The demon I've subdued to guide me ran... I mean got separated from me. And my horse got eaten... I mean I gave it a break.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I've been lost... I mean fighting by myself for days and then... I ran into you! I was so scared...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see. Very virtuous.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe it was too soon for you to travel?  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
What? You got a problem with a virtuous monk like me!?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
By. The. Way. Isn't it about time you tell me about yourself?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...I see... Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Incinerated Earth... Singularities with Holy Grails... Guardians of Humanity...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
It's all rather grandiose and hard to believe, but... you're Fujimaru of Chaldea, which is from the future...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I believe your story. This must be part of the Buddha's guidance... I'm sure.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
The Buddha exists beyond space and time. He could send a messenger from the future to the past.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
So, how do you go back to Chaldea?  
Don't you have any tools to send an emergency signal?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Actually, no.  
   
**Sanzang:**   
You're lost! Oh my, so you're lost too!  
Good, good, we're rather alike, you and I!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...Ahem. I mean, uh, now I know the reason behind our encounter, Fujimaru.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm still not sure that I traveled to the past  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Then again, you can't pinpoint your exact coordinates right now. In that case, we're just wasting time sitting here arguing.  
  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
When I become great, I will say this: Do good deeds, punish bad deeds, and listen to Sanzang.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
So, Fujimaru?  
Become my disciple!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Why?  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Uh... I mean... I'm...still in the middle of the journey...  
And I've got a long way to go...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I've got no food... My tummy is beyond empty... But all worldly things are transitory... Anyway, I need a disciple!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If you will make me your number one disciple.  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Of course! Easy peasy!  
You are my number one disciple! Yay!  
  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...To tell the truth, I remember a little bit. I think I've experienced this journey to Tianzhu once before.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
But I can't remember the specifics.  
Just like you don't know left from right here.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
It's very strange, but this must be some kind of meaningful fate for the both of us.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
This journey to the west is a trial from the Buddha.  
So he won't give you an answer. He won't do anything.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Most likely there's a reason for this.  
To send you back to Chaldea&mdash;  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
That's the challenge I was given.  
For you, it's a gift from on high.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
So... From now on, you can call me “Master”!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
“Master” is taken, so... Mentor!  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Ugh, I feel like I've been called that before...  
No, you must properly address me as Master!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't overdo it, Sanzang-chan.  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Ugh, just so you know, I won't take a rebellious pupil like you to nirvana!  
  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Anyway, scriptures won't just fall into our hands.  
Come, let's head to the land in the far west, Tianzhu!  
GO WEST! GO!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hey, Fujimaru! Are you here?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai! Master! Please answer me!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is not good. [♂ He /♀ She] must have moved.  
It will be hard to figure out the exact coordinates again...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor! Can you at least send me to the coordinates where Senpai is!?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm trying to figure out why [♂ he /♀ she] got transported right now. It would be so much easier if we knew.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'll do my best, of course.  
But I'm sorry, Mash.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai...  
  
   
## Volume 1: "Kingdom of Tartars: Along on the Journey"  
   
**Sanzang:**   
It's coming back to me now!  
I had three disciples!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Say, disciple! Do you happen to know about my past disciples?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are they a monkey, a pig...and a kappa?  
   
**Sanzang:**   
A kappa? What's a kappa?  
No idea what that is... Kapa, kapapa...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A black panther, a puppy, and glasses.  
   
**Sanzang:**   
You mean, a dog, a monkey and a pheasant, right? Huh? Why do I know that...  
  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Anyway, speaking of monkeys... Sun... Sun Wukong!  
My reliable number one disciple!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you had pupils before?  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Oh... I'm sorry. I did say I was gonna make you my number one disciple, huh? My bad.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear anything.  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...Thank you for your thoughtfulness.  
You're so kind, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
But there's no need to worry! I'm sure I'll remember why I lost my disciples during our journey.  
  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
But this is a problem. A huge problem, perhaps.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I'm on a journey to Tianzhu, but I wonder why Sun Wukong isn't here.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Not just Wukong... But the other two pupils too... That's right, Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing are not here either...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
This must be a message from the Buddha, too.  
I mean, journeys are always so mysterious!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The new number one disciple will take care of it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You have me now, right?  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...W-Wait a minute, what am I getting so flustered for!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I'm impressed that a new disciple like yourself can think like that! But that's prohibited here.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
As a disciple, you must follow the Buddha's teachings and worship him. Be careful not to brag too much.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
The law of the jungle applies to the journey to Tianzhu. If you are not careful, you will be eaten by demons.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
But... well... considering the hardships we're going to face, having another disciple or two would be reassuring...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
For example... Zhu Bajie...  
  
   
**B：???:**  
Oink, oink.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oink?  
   
  
   
**B：???:**  
Oink, oink. Oink!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...What is this!? I'm hearing the squeal of a poor piggy...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Could it be Zhu Bajie!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It came from the other side of the rocks...  
   
  
   
**B：???:**  
I'm oink. Very oink!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, David, it's YOU!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah, he's a pig. Definitely.  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
His name is... David? Just like Fujimaru, he was underneath a rock!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
No, no. I'm the cool Zhu Bajie. ...Well, here, at least. That's how things seem to have turned out.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Fujimaru's friend?  
Then he's a member of Chaldea, too?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A pig? But you're a shepherd...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Just ignore him...  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
No more indecisive attitude!  
Anyway, I'll rescue you from there right now!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
aryavalokitesvaro bodhisattvo gambhirayam prajnaparamitayam caryam caramano vyavalokayati...  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
I'm saved... Thank you! I couldn't do anything by myself. I thought I was going to become a monster's dinner.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Right, but the situation was about to get much worse.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
I was starting to feel good about being squished.  
Whew, that was a close one, oink.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ah... You saved him...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This guy can have fun anywhere, huh?  
   
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
It was truly painful! I want to emphasize that part!  
I mean, I can sue for damages later!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
No, let's refrain from talking about that now.  
So you are Xuanzang Sanzang... As beautiful as rumored.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
That dress is so beautiful and perfect for a wedding. Were you expecting this chance meeting?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Huh? This is an important kasaya given to me by the Buddha.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...Ummm, don't confuse it with a wedding dress, okay?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you going to ignore the fact she's basically a nun?  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Why? There's no problem, right?  
Anyway&mdash;  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Too bad, but she's ordained. She's not Abishag.  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Not Abishag? NO?!  
Such a waste! Well, anyway&mdash;  
  
   
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
It's true her beauty makes me want to eat her up!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Hi, my name is Zhu Bajie David. Oh beautiful lady with long black hair, I will gladly become your disciple.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Actually, there's another one stuck under the rock who's fit to be your disciple. He got involved in the same fashion as me.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
I guess calling out for help is just too much for his pride.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Jeez. Pride won't earn you a penny, oink.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You should have a little bit more pride...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you know the word “shameless”?  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
We'll talk later! Show me where he is!  
We don't want the rock to crush him!  
  
   
**C：???:**  
You have my gratitude for releasing me from this prison. My name is Li Shuwen, an assassin not worth mentioning.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
It seems here I will be known as the third disciple, Sha Wujing... You may refer to me as so from now on.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Master Li, are you sure?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Becoming a disciple that easily?  
   
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Well, what's the difference between Servants and Chinese opera actors? It matters not.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
How am I supposed to refuse the wish of a highly respectable monk? That aside&mdash;  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
It's such an honor to meet the Xuanzang Sanzang whom I grew so fond of from the fairy tales I read when I was young.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
You don't need to praise me like that... I'm the one who should thank you. I hear you are a renowned master of the spear. How reassuring!  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Of course. I will behead as many enemies as you'd like and offer you their heads just to serve you well.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...B-Behead!? Heads? No, no, no! That's so unsettling! Don't kill for no reason! It's prohibited!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Oh no... We're surrounded!?  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
It looks like the monsters we got rid of earlier have returned, oink. They brought their buddies to share their food they found in the wasteland.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
It's just been one thing after another.  
But we can't let them eat us without a fight.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Is it all right, my master?  
This is self-defense, not some unnecessary killing.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Th-That's fine, go ahead, Sha Wujing!  
But try to disperse them first...  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Understood. And how interesting. You're more virtuous than the Xuanzang I've read about!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Now then. We can't let Master walk on this long, difficult journey. We disciples are one thing, but she's another.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Do you want to ride on my shoulders?  
I don't have a ponytail, unfortunately, but... Oink.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Uh, I wholeheartedly refuse. However, I do wish we had someone to carry our luggage... Hmm?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There is something running wildly over there...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That big red body... Is it a horse?  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Red? Can it be...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
The Tartars of this land are known for breeding great horses! Can we bring one over here?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
If that's your wish!  
  
   
**White Dragon Horse:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...Let's go home.  
There's nothing here. NO WEST.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
That's Lu Bu. Yup, Lu Bu.  
So the fourth companion is that fierce warrior.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
I see, instead of the famed Red Hare, we get its rider instead. Well, it should not pose a problem for us. My master, please take a ride.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
No! I can't, I can't!  
This horse is scary&mdash;!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Whoa there! Whoa!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's in his hand? A scroll...?  
   
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
...Hmm?  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Despite your appearance, it seems you're quite meticulous. You're carefully guarding that, huh?  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
[♂ Brother /♀ Sister] Fujimaru?  
Why don't you show that to the master?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...Th-This is... the lost scripture!  
You were protecting it by yourself in this wasteland?  
  
   
**White Dragon Horse:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I'm so sorry that I screamed.  
You are an amazing attendant, and an amazing horse!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
It's scary, but it's part of my training!  
Oh magnificent red horse, lend me your shoulders!  
  
   
**White Dragon Horse:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
On his shoulders!?  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Wait! There was an option to ride on my shoulders too, oink!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Hey, actually, this is nice.  
Are you used to letting people ride on your shoulders?  
  
   
**White Dragon Horse:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
I'm used to it, too!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
What? The monsters had this scripture?  
And there must be more?  
  
   
**White Dragon Horse:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...Strange, very strange indeed.  
Also, Zhu Bajie, you need to shut up.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...My mind is clearing as I read this scripture...  
Was that how they work? Oh well...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Sun Wukong! Sha Wujing! Bad Bajie!  
This is my commemorable first order!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
We, the Sanzang crew, will collect the scriptures on our way to Tianzhu!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
If you have any objections, I won't get mad, so come forward!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I'll put this golden headband around your head and start preaching! I'll make you change your mind! No one shall go against me!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I guess refusal is not an option...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is Sanzang possibly... a demon herself?  
   
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Kaka! That's the great Sanzang I know!  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
She defeats every evildoer that stands in her way... even those who have reformed! A flawless beauty that troubled even the heinous three!  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Fujimaru, let it go. This is the real Sanzang.  
You can't escape this fate.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
We have no choice but to accompany her on this journey. Well well, this is getting interesting!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So that's the kind of person she is!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Must collect... scriptures!  
   
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
I don't think this is interesting, oink!  
  
   
## Volume 2: "Flat Peak Mountain: The Attractive Demon Sisters of the Lotus Cave"  
   
**Golden Horn:**   
Silver Horn, it seems like this fearless, pitiful Tang monk has stepped into our territory: the Lotus Cave.  
  
   
**Silver Horn:**   
Golden Horn, it seems like this cute and delicious-looking Tang monk was lured in by the aroma from the Flat Peak Mountain.  
  
   
**Golden Horn:**   
If it's a man, let's melt him all the way to the bone. Taunt him, torture him, and then swallow him. Isn't that right, Silver Horn?  
  
   
**Silver Horn:**   
Yes, Golden Horn. However, if it's a woman, let's welcome her warm-heartedly, play with her, befriend her, and then slowly drink her dry... Hehehe.  
  
   
**Both:**   
Ah, I'm aching with excitement...  
I can hardly wait any longer.  
  
   
**Both:**   
...That aside, we sure are perfect for these roles, aren't we...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Wasteland as far as the eye can see... I thought we would run into some kind of oasis if we followed caravan routes...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Am I hallucinating!? But my throat is dry and my belly is empty... Oh, dear Buddha! Are you out shopping?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are we in the past?  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Are you asking if we Rayshifted to the era when Sanzang was alive?  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Well, I don't think that's the case,  
[♂ Brother /♀ Sister] Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
We've spent many days here already, yet you didn't see that ring of light in the sky, right?  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
However, a constant supply of magical energy is needed for us Servants to exist. That supply is coming from somewhere right now.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are we in the world of “Journey to the West”?  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Now, if you say you are being forced to play in the drama “Journey to the West,” then there is no place for us to be here.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
There should be the real Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, and Sha Wujing right next to our master. What's the point of recreating the play with her alone?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...Ugh.  
  
   
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
My master. Do you have any ideas?  
Didn't you feel something by getting the scripture?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Yes... I remembered one thing.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I don't know why, but... I dismissed my disciples,  
Sun Wukong and the others.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
All three have left my side.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
...I see.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Did you lay them all off when they fulfilled their terms? Restructuring, eh? How cold and unsentimental.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
But I won't denounce my master.  
Because you can't be a manager unless you are realistic.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Well, I wouldn't let them leave if it were up to me!  
They always say, “Make a pig fat, then eat it,” right!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's true, oink.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
When are you getting fat then, oink?  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Hmmm... You may be right...  
That's why they're not with me right now...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't get so depressed.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm sure they'll be back again sometime.  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Do you really think so...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...That aside, I'm not feeling good right now...  
It feels like someone punched me in the stomach...  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
No doubt because you haven't eaten anything. I guess we have no choice but to feed you a monster's flesh and blood.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Not that... Please don't...  
  
   
**White Dragon Horse:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He's saying there is a cave up ahead!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe there's water.  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Hey...Fujimaru, ...just one thing...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Who is... Mash? You were calling that name when you were under the rock.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Fujimaru, is she important to you?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...A junior that's very important to me.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I feel like we are together even when we are apart.  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...I see...  
  
   
**???:**  
...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Something smells sweet... The smell of fruits...  
This place, it must be a food storage!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
That's my number one disciple! You have a great nose,  
I mean, intuition! Let's eat!  
  
   
**White Dragon Horse:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Uh, what? A trap?  
That peach is rotten?  
  
   
**Golden Horn:**   
Oh. I thought you'd be the one to eat it first and turn into a carrot. I guess it won't be that easy.  
  
   
**Golden Horn:**   
Hehe, welcome to the Lotus Cave, Tang monk and her apprentices.  
  
   
**Silver Horn:**   
I am so tired of waiting. But that monkey there looks ready to eat, all dehydrated like that.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The evil-looking Gorgon Sisters!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wait a minute, they don't recognize us!?  
   
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
The Lotus Cave, you said. That means they are the Golden Horned King and the Silver Horned King&mdash;  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
...They're so similar it's sad to even look.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
That's not good. It's not just they're way too into their roles, they're even turning back to being the goddesses that bring destruction upon humans.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
I see... It seems you are aware of the enemy's True Name&mdash;  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Fujimaru. I don't think I need to explain, but Golden Horn and Silver Horn will come with THOSE.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
If you answer to your name, that gourd will suck you in and melt you alive.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
The Purple Gold Red Gourd and the Suet Jade Flask.  
I cannot see them.  
  
   
**Silver Horn:**   
There's no need for us to use Noble Phantasms. Once you're under our poison, you will call out our names and beg us.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
I see. So this cave is like a gourd's reservoir, and we are flies that fell on the surface of the water.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Trying to fight the enemies in your own safe zone...  
How unscrupulous! Shame on you, you wicked women!  
  
   
**Golden Horn:**   
It's not unscrupulous, it's negligent. But then, I can sense the same smell from you too, though.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Humph, I don't think so, lady.  
Did you think I would get mad being provoked?  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
If I'm in danger just by being here, then I will leave the fighting to the experts. I'm stepping back, oink.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Come on, [♂ Brother /♀ Sister] Fujimaru!  
Please take care of them!  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Of course. The main feature of “Journey to the West” is the tales of demon huntings!  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Looks like neither Golden Horn nor Silver Horn are trained. Lord Red Horse and myself will suffice&mdash;!  
  
   
**White Dragon Horse:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!  
  
   
**Golden Horn:**   
Idiot. Sweet ladies like us wouldn't want to get blood blisters from spears or get the rusted metal smell of swords on us, would we?  
  
   
**Silver Horn:**   
There is a lot of food and water here.  
And the scriptures you are seeking, too.  
  
   
**Golden Horn:**   
But we will consume everything.  
  
   
**Both:**   
Come! Melt them, unthaw them, dissolve them and drink them all up...  
  
   
**Both:**   
&mdash;Bronze Horn!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Bronze Horn&mdash;!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's the first I've heard of it!?  
   
  
   
**Bronze Horn:**   
Ummm... Right... I'm Bronze Horn...  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Great! Bronze Horn is outside of my strike zone!  
Don't hold back and defeat her!  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
...No. I am a warrior, not a demon. This bond between these sisters is too tragic, I cannot bear to witness it any longer...  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Honestly, I have lost my will to fight.  
My master, shouldn't we save Bronze Horn over there?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
No, we can't. I can tell this is just another one of their tricks.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
It's a conventional method to make us lower our guard. We can't buy into it.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Besides, my stomach is at its limit!  
We'll talk after we have taken their food!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
GO, Fujimaru!  
Begin with that big girl first!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's to save my mentor, I have no choice!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Girl...?  
   
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Well, I'm stuffed!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Golden Horn and Silver Horn escaped, but they didn't really do anything bad, so let's turn a blind eye for now!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Wise decision. The spoils of war are more important right now. Oh, leave the management of the treasure to me. I'll make sure it's done right.  
  
   
**Bronze Horn:**   
...Victory is yours. Go ahead and do whatever you want with me. I don't care.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
How admirable. You're willing to give up your old ways even though you're a demon! ...But then again, you haven't done anything wrong, have you?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Let's see, which should I have you do... 10,000 Hindu squats or copying the Heart Sutra 10,000 times...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
You look fit already, so maybe copying the Heart Sutra will be a good punishment.  
  
   
**Bronze Horn:**   
Well then, I will copy the sutra.  
Yes, copying sounds good. I'm not good at that.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Okay! Then I'll write you a recommendation letter to the librarian at Daci'en Temple! Study hard!  
  
   
**Bronze Horn:**   
Thank you so much.  
Personally this is the best thing ever!  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Bronze Horn... No, I shouldn't say anything now. It's better than being turned into some kind of demon king.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
My mentor. Here is the scripture.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sanzang. The scripture.  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Um... Yes. I see, so you've done your job.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I was a little worried, but it seems this time around my disciples are hard workers!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Wukong, Wujing, Bajie! Thank you guys!  
Now, let's continue with our journey to Tianzhu!  
  
   
## Volume 3: "Fire Cloud Cave: Sage King, Red Boy"  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Wow, the wind feels so good! We are finally done with the desert area... Now it should be peaceful for a while!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
This whole area looks familiar, too... Now I remember.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Right. And I was thinking...  
We just need to avoid every enemy base from now on!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I pretty much already know the locations!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
That's an excellent plan, my master.  
It's good to be able to relax, oink.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
By its very nature, I do not think a journey of hardship given by the Buddha would be done in by such pretentiousness...  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
&mdash;Hmm!?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Wait, wait, wait a minute!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
You must be Sanzang and her followers! Right!?  
I'm not gonna let you go any further! (HAH)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We've got a sloppy one here.  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Now, now. Let's follow the protocol and ask for her identity.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let me ask you just in case, who are you?  
   
  
   
**E：???:**  
How dare you ask me that!  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
I am the protector of the Fire Cloud Cave in Withered Pine Valley: Red Boy, the Boy Sage King!  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Oh, damn, I said my name first! But it's no problem! (HAH)  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Red Boy... You have reformed and surrendered yourself to the Bodhisattva... Why do you stand in our way?  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Because my father will praise me!  
...If I return home with your heads, that is!  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Your father must be the Ox-Demon King.  
According to the story of Journey to the West, that is.  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Hey, call him by his proper name! He's the Great Sage Who Pacifies Heaven, the King of Great Strength, the Nine-Headed Ox-Demon King!  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Oh, damn, I said it again! But that's fine!  
My father is cool, anyway!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I feel for your father...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That whole family is messed up...  
   
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Red Boy is supposed to kidnap Sanzang through disguises and other tricks. Are you okay with all this?  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Humph. The story is meant to be changed.  
I'm not willing to lose from the beginning!  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
I see. Short-tempered, but quite eloquent.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Hmm, Saber of Red's father...  
In other words, you're part of the Altriaverse.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
If that's the case, I don't know if it'll be blue or white, but I think I have an idea who this “father” is.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't think so. Not at all.  
   
**White Dragon Horse:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Red Horse agrees, too. There are just too many.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And who do you think it'll be?  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
If it's the Ox-Demon King...  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
“Only the ones who ate roast beef with tears in their eyes know the true taste of beef! Cow Saber!”  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
&mdash;and such? Oh, I'm so sorry. Please continue?  
  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Hmm, I can die in peace!  
I've never seen such an inspirational attitude!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
What a graceful opponent she is...  
I think I can get along with her pretty well!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
But it's too bad. Even if you were a friend, I'll crush you if you get in my way. That's my attitude!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Get ready! I will go dhūtatatatata on you and eliminate you!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I'll give you a chance to reform yourself afterwards!  
I mean, we're already halfway friends!  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Are you serious, really!?  
You're really good at making friends, huh!?  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
But, sorry, I won't go easy on you even if we were friends. Because I'm Red Boy, the beloved son of the Ox-Demon King!  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Sanzang! I'm going to take you as an offering to my father!  
  
   
**White Dragon Horse:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Whoa, you scared me. I'm still not used to it...  
&mdash;Are you ready, Fujimaru!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sure! I don't think she'll hand it over without a fight!  
   
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Dammit, fine! You won! Here's the scripture!  
Take it and get out of here!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Wait a second, Red Boy.  
No, Mo Boy!  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Mo Boy!?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Where do you think you're going? You know that neither the Fire Cloud Cave nor the Sky Scraping Cave is that way.  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Where I go is none of your business.  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Since I just lost to the heinous Sanzang group, I'm just gonna hide until things die down.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...If you want to see your father so much, how come you don't go home?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
You adored your father so much!  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
I don't adore him, I HATE him!  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Anyway... I can't go back to that miserable house now.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
You are a runaway? I see, you wanted to defeat us so you could go home with pride.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Still, your father did raise an obnox&ndash; sorry, kind person like you. You don't need to bring him any gifts, oink!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
I'm sure he will welcome you with open arms. Come on, go home now and take us to where the treasures are, oink!  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
You're making it sound nice, but you're really annoying, you know!?  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Not only that... While my father may be really cool, my mother is...  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
She's like a dump truck with busted brakes, to put it mildly...  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
She's just extremely scary... My dad is usually tough, but even he's kinda whipped by my mom...  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
If you are going to proceed, be careful, Sanzang!  
It's better for you not to get involved with that woman!  
  
   
## Volume 4: "Flaming Mountain: That Mountain is Very Fun!"  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Guys! Those mountains there must be so much fun!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is it, all of a sudden?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hey, don't jinx us like that.  
   
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
...? Our master seems to be very hyper.  
I wonder what's up with her?  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
We defeated Red Boy. In that case, our next big obstacle is the Flaming Mountains.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
...On a different note, my master...  
We are being followed.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Did you sense their presence? That's fine.  
It's natural that we're being targeted by demons.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
It's actually rather convenient for us.  
We can lose them in the Flaming Mountains up ahead!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
...Hot... It's...so...hot... Oink... [♂ Brother /♀ Sister] Fujimaru, to be honest...  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Despite my appearance, I can't stand the heat...  
It's like I'm going to get roasted...  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Yes... These evil mountains are worse than expected.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
The flames here don't extinguish with rain, nor do they burn out. They say they can even melt the toughest iron.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
No wonder Servants, much less normal humans, would want to avoid this place...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's like hell on Earth...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't tell me...  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Of course! I mean, those mountains are definitely interesting!  
  
   
**White Dragon Horse:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
My master, he's saying, “It's not just about having fun!” Oink!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
That's because you haven't had enough training!  
Perfect, let's earn you some Training Points right now!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
This is the Buddha's providence!  
You just need to get used to hardships!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
We can't get to Tianzhu without crossing these burning mountains! Never!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A-Any specific plans!?  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Don't worry about it.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Aside from the demons, I too had anticipated these Flaming Mountains.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I've piled on merits during my journey to acquire scriptures, so I can walk freely on fire.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
The ascetic exercise of fire-walking, huh?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
This hellfire, too, was once just a leaping flame from the Eight Trigrams Furnace up in heaven.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
If it's a trial from the Buddha, this fire will surely die if I walk through it!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I wonder if it really will be that easy?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I have a bad feeling.  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Just watch.  
...Although I might need some time!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
(Inhale... Exhale...)  
(Inhale... Exhale...)  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
I wanna see♪  
how brave our master is♪  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
(Gulp)  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
...She went for it.  
She's really walking on the flame...  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
She's gone.  
I didn't think she would really do it, oink.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
But still, speaking from my experience as a roasted pig... Even if you can walk on fire, there's still the intense heat and smoke, you know?  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Ah! You're right! I should have thought about that!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We have to save her!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Run, White Dragon Horse! Bring her back here!  
   
**White Dragon Horse:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!  
  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Cough...cough cough... Ugh...  
I thought I was gonna die...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Apparently, flesh burns even if it's not touching the fire... So that's what it means to smoke something...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
If I wasn't wearing the Tathagata's kasaya, I would have turned into coal...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
W-Was it fun?  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Beyond uncool... These mountains were not fun at all... (Sniff)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't make us worry!  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I'm... I'm beyond sorry... I have learned my lesson...  
  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
But...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
It's different... It's completely different!  
They're not the Flaming Mountains I know!  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
What do you mean, my frizzy-haired master?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
...pai...Senpai...are...there...!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I hear a voice!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh...thank goodness... I've been waiting so long, Senpai!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor! Doctor! Please come to the Command Room immediately!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Oh. A transmission from Chaldea?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The line's very unstable...  
I will put it briefly before the signal cuts off!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
...Oh.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
No, it's nothing. You just talk with them, [♂ Brother /♀ Sister].  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Yes, take your time. We'll cover you.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Those are...the demons that we drove off in the mountains!? They're coming this way...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why are we being attacked now of all times!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll leave it to you, my fellow disciples!  
   
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I think I got the rough idea, Mash!  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Noted. So, what does the Doctor say?  
   
**Mash:**   
The Doctor is here too, but he's a little busy at the moment!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So I will relay the message for now!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
...And that was the report on the summoning experiment, and the analysis on this unexpected incident.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The situation is not resolved yet. We can't let our guard down.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
However, I'm surprised... To think there would be this much time lag between us!  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
It has already been a month since we first departed from Tartar territory.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
On our side, it's only been four days since the accident  
&mdash;Oh...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm still detecting Servant readings around the Flaming Mountains. I even picked up traces of potent Ether.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I suspect some kind of crazy experiment with magecraft. It must've been conducted by a high-ranking Caster as well.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's probably...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A mage that can hover over the Flaming Mountains?  
   
  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Xa-xa-xa-xa-xa-xa-xa-xa!  
  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Great! Eternal flame of Sanat Kumara!  
I will boil down this Dagda's Cauldron like it was jam!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A UFO!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's shooting a beam into the volcano!?  
   
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
&mdash;I don't know who's been summoned, but I'm sure she's a troublesome Servant, oink.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I'm at a loss for words, too. But I'm sure this is also the Buddha's unwavering will.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Xuanzang... Sanzang? I see... so you are a woman!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh no... The signal is unstable... The communication...  
I can't...correct...time difference...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru! Make sure you tell Sanzang what we talked about.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Also tell her... that she herself is the key!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
The transmission got cut off again. I wonder when we will be able to communicate with them again.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
They seem to be having difficulty bringing us back to Chaldea.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
I'm pretty sure it's because Mash is not here. She would normally have set up the summoning circle for us.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
...We cannot afford to turn back now, either.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
The idea of heading to Tianzhu and being at the mercy of Buddha's guidance doesn't sound too absurd anymore.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Eh... So you agreed to travel with me half-heartedly?  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Hmmm... For Shuwen, he's content as long as he gets to fight powerful enemies.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Maybe I'm the same? But what about [♂ Brother /♀ Sister] Fujimaru?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...What...do you think? Fujimaru?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There must be light at the end of this tunnel!  
   
**Sanzang:**   
&mdash;Of course! I won't give up after only one or two lifetimes!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Because this is my story!  
Thank you, Fujimaru!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The key must lie within the scriptures we gather.  
   
**Sanzang:**   
The skinny guy from Chaldea said the same thing. In that case, then I'm truly dancing on top of the Buddha's palm...  
  
   
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
&mdash;Brothers, wait.  
  
   
**H：???:**  
The Flaming Mountains... They are a test.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Uh!?  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Oh, a new face? At any rate, not one we have seen in Chaldea.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that the one who's been following us?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Twintails and a Chinese dress?  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...Ugh... You are... Ugh...  
I feel like I can almost remember you...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Why? It's so frustrating! This intense feeling of déjà vu is suffocating...  
  
   
**H：???:**  
Impossible. Can not remember.  
  
   
**H：???:**  
That memory. Inside. This scripture.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
!?  
  
   
**H：???:**  
&mdash;Lamentable. Xuanzang Sanzang. Once pure and holy. Currently despicable. Mediocre woman.  
  
   
**H：???:**  
No will to sacrifice thyself. Bereft tolerance and benevolence. Know there is... no shortcut to Tianzhu.  
  
   
**H：???:**  
Simply put. You. No longer fit as Qitian Dasheng's master.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Uh! (Shocked)  
  
   
**H：???:**  
Chat. Completed.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Twintails gave her a lecture...  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
You're wrong, [♂ Brother /♀ Sister]. If the hair doesn't reach the shoulders, it's more appropriate to call it “pigtails,” oink.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Flying away on wheels... I'm jealous.  
   
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
That person might appear collected, but in truth, she was agitated to the point that she abandoned her role as an observer and interfered...  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Yeah. She seemed like she knew our master well... Well?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
To be honest... I can't quite remember...  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
I see. Your memory has been locked away.  
However... I have an idea as to who she really is.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
That flaming spear must be the Fire-tipped Spear...  
And those bangles she wore must be the Universe Ring...  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
In addition, her young appearance...  
Although she does speak in a strange tone...  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
It appears that she might be Prince Nezha, the Marshal of the Central Altar&mdash; One with a name as well-known as Qitian Dasheng, Sun Wukong.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Ne...zha...  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Don't underestimate that young warrior.  
She's a doll made entirely of Paopei.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
In Chaldea's terminology, she would probably be called a Noble Phantasm Human. I feel I must cross swords with that warrior.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sensei's bad habit is back...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Didn't it seem like she was worrying about Lu Bu?  
   
**White Dragon Horse:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;?  
  
   
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
She left with the scripture that contains the master's memory.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
So we came up dry this time.  
It seems like we can't cheat.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
There's always someone watching...  
I guess that's the same in every country.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...Banana Leaf...Fan...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I remember now!  
Yes, the Banana Leaf Fan!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Listen, we took the wrong steps. We need a Noble Phantasm... An item to cross the Flaming Mountains!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
We need the Banana Leaf Fan!  
Princess Iron Fan's Noble Phantasm!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Banana Leaf Fan?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Princess Iron Fan?  
   
  
   
## Volume 5: "Banana Cave: Demonic Lady, Princess Iron Fan"  
   
**Sanzang:**   
In order to extinguish the wild flames of the Flaming Mountains and get to Tianzhu, we definitely need the “Banana Leaf Fan.”  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
And Princess Iron Fan, the one who resides in the Banana Leaf Cave, is the wielder of said fan.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
A world-renowned beauty, also known as the Demonic Lady, a Rakshesa. I wonder what kind of beautiful madam she is?  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Yeah, an older married woman doesn't sound bad. Anyway, a beautiful lady is beautiful even if she is someone else's wife.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Hey you! Don't get excited about the “someone else's wife” part. Keep it to yourself!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Anyway, it's impossible to predict what kind of people we'll meet on this journey...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Based on what Mo Boy said, I can take a guess...  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
No joke! No joke! My mom is so scary!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Red Boy.  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
GAH! Mom! Sorry, I was eating some potato chips!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Correction. You will address me as “Mother,” or else I will cut that infected tongue out.  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Sorry, Mom! Please don't cut my tongue off!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
I will tolerate staying out overnight without permission... but did you wash your hands when you got home?  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
I did! Very thoroughly for about five seconds!  
Then dried them with the Banana Leaf Fan!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
That explains the mess in the bathroom. What happens if those germs get spread around the castle?  
  
   
**F：???:**  
I've told you to carry disposable towels with you so many times... Hmmm? Did you rinse your mouth after returning home?  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Of course! For about three seconds while drinking cola!  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Hear my beautiful voice. We have a similar voice, right? Genetically mother and child!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
...Red Boy. What's that scratch on your cheek?  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
(Gasp)  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Just a scratch! It's nothing!  
Just put some saliva on it and&mdash;  
  
   
**F：???:**  
&mdash;It seems I need to teach you a lesson.  
To the medical room. I will treat you myself.  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
Ahhhhhh, I'm sorry, Mom!  
  
   
**Red Boy:**   
I don't wanna wash my face in a bucket of peroxide again!  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
...It's kind of like an army torture scene.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Too much enthusiasm for education...  
Kids grow up open-minded when left free, but...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Either way, she's nobody's fool...  
We did beat Red Boy, but didn't kill him.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
There's no reason Princess Iron Fan would get mad.  
I'm sure we can just talk it out!  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
Rejected & please leave now.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
You wouldn't even consider it!?  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
There have been no reports of anyone falling ill around the Flaming Mountains.  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
Those flames must have strong anti-bacterial effects.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But no one is alive either!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oh, come on!  
   
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
I am quite offended that you would criticize my charity work.  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
There are many uses for the Banana Leaf Fan.  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
However, I cannot lend it to you for a trivial reason like extinguishing a mountain fire.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...By the way, where is the Ox-Demon King?  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
Ox-Demon King... My partner is not here in this castle. He must be wandering about...  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
Even Red Boy is following his bad example...  
My patience is just about running out.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's not a good idea to take your frustration out on your son.  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
My principle of education is perfect!  
I even allow my son independence!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just allowing?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you tolerant?  
   
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
Um... Well...  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
...Fujimaru, was it?  
Did you come here to provoke me?  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
I'm always furious... at this unsanitary world... at the fact that accursed disease runs rampant everywhere.  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
Yes! Travelers like you are especially beyond help!  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
Greedy for repletion, knowledge, and pleasure; living as you desire. You would dig up buried relics and wake dormant indigenous diseases.  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
Surely you're going about spreading a pandemic of pallidness. You're nothing but a walking compost!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
That's not true! I simply bought some buns, and threw the leftovers on the street!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
It's charity for the animals. I litter. With no hesitation.  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
&mdash;I am so careless. There is one facility this mountain is missing.  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
The chef with the red cape said, “the pig is a very useful domestic animal. The only part you can't use is its scream.”  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
Let's test those words.  
Don't worry, I'm a nurse.  
  
   
**Princess Iron Fan:**   
I'm used to people writhing and screaming in pain. Scream like you could tear up the sky!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Phew, good response to provocation, deathly nurse!  
I'll leave the rest to you, [♂ Brother /♀ Sister]!  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
I don't get along with ladies who don't understand humor!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Fine, I'll accept the challenge!  
You guys, I'm counting on you!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Sanzang:**   
So...this is the Banana Leaf Fan?  
Looks pretty different than the legends...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Doesn't it look...like a certain holy sword?  
Is it even okay for a monk to hold a sword?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
It is said that in order to cut the root of the fire from the Flaming Mountains, one needs to fan the flame forty-nine times. But she said that since this is EX-ranked, you just need to fan it once.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Princess Iron Fan handed out the scripture she possessed obediently. I cannot fathom the reason that only the Banana Leaf Fan would be a fake.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Anyhow, once we use it, we'll know if it's fake or not, oink.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
That's true. I'll try!  
Here we go&mdash;  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Ex...calibanana Leaf Fan!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Amazing! It's gone! It blew all the fire away!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
So all that fire-walking training for nothing?  
Well, never mind!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Fujimaru! We did it!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um, so only the Ox-Demon King is left?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's hope the Ox-Demon King is understanding.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
&mdash;Yes!  
  
   
## Volume 6: "Sky Scraping Cave: Great Sage Who Pacifies Heaven, Ox-Demon King"  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
I am the eldest of a fraternity of demon brothers whose names are renowned even up in heaven&mdash;  
I am the Nine-Headed Ox-Demon King!  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
Hereafter, you may refer to me as Ox-Demon King.  
No need to prostrate yourselves. Just relax.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
&mdash;Yes, Your Majesty.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
...  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um... Ox? Cow?  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
You&mdash; What are you looking at?  
My eyes are up here.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
I must commend you for your efforts. You traveled all the way from Tang, even crossing the Flaming Mountains...  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
...Rumor has it that my son, Red Boy, caused you trouble?  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
No need to tense up.  
I am not being sarcastic.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
You may laugh at me for being a bad parent.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Not at all Oh, by the way.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
We...um...kind of forcibly borrowed this from your wife.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
The Excalibanana Leaf Fan.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
We understand it is... your prized possession. We would like to return it now.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
&mdash;Yes, you have my gratitude once again.  
Then let me move on to important matters.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
O eminent Tang Monk, Xuanzang Sanzang&mdash;  
This is the scripture that has been entrusted to me.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
And this is the other scripture Nezha gave me when she visited this castle earlier.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nezha did that?  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
You may have both of these scriptures.  
It is the Buddha's will.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
Meaning, your journey ends here.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...Wh-What did you say?  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
I said it's the Buddha's will.  
You now have all six scriptures.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
&mdash;The Buddha gave me a mission.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
The Buddha said he sealed your memory of the realization of the transient nature of the five desires into the scriptures scattered along the trip.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
The five desires are sights, sounds, scents, tastes, and tactility.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
In other words, the attachment that arises from contact with the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
This kind of explanation probably sounds unnecessary to you, though, right?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
One, two, three, four, five... What's the last one?  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
The last of the six scriptures is “meaning.”  
The attachment produced by the heart.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
Ending your journey here and being satisfied from the bottom of your heart will recover the enlightenment you lost&mdash;!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
What... What? Wait. Wait!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
My journey doesn't end here!  
It still continues!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I'm going to Tianzhu! That's why I've traveled this far!  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
You already have all the scriptures!  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
Do you not understand!? It is the Buddha's mercy, Xuanzang Sanzang.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
But what'll happen with them?  
What's going to happen to my dear disciples?  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
Your apprentices will continue on to Tianzhu.  
That will bring them back to the world they belong to.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
You, too, must have a place to go back to.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...A place to go back to... My house in Chang'an...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...No! I want to continue my journey!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I haven't accomplished anything!  
I appreciate the scriptures, but that's not it!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I'm not ready to recite them correctly.  
I'm not there yet!  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
How unreasonable you are...  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
The scriptures of the Buddha possess an inherent value to the common folk. They do not care who is reciting them   
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
If you cannot realize that, you sure are far from enlightenment.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
No need to worry, though.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
Let me blow your attachment away and send you back to the furthest ends of the Far East with my fan, the Excalibanana Leaf Fan.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...I see... This is my own battle.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Fujimaru... You guys shouldn't come...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Otherwise it will make the Buddha angry and you won't be able to return.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
...O Xuanzang Sanzang.  
The monk I temporarily revered as my master.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
If you think of me as someone who cleverly reflects on the consequences before fighting my enemies, you're wrong.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Yeah. We're Servants after all.  
We don't have anywhere to go back to.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Returning to the Throne of Heroes means we will disappear. Chaldea is an exception, but we can't return there quite yet.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
There is a place I want to go back to.  
But I'll just fight, have fun, and die, though.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
And this big dude here, it's like preaching to whatchamacallit.  
  
   
**White Dragon Horse:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Fujimaru ...No, my unworthy number one disciple? What about you?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
You are not a Servant.  
You should go back to those dear to you.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're dear to me, too.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you really need to ask that?  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Oh...you...DUMMY!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
You're all so fearless, you stupid pupils!  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
&mdash;This is the final warning!  
You will be disobeying the Buddha!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Get out of the way, Ox-Demon King!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
West, here we come! To the west!  
   
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
I...It's...  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
It's not my fault!  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
I only made one wish in exchange for complying with the Buddha!  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
Princess Iron Fan's table and tablecloth and tableware and table napkins! Everything!  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
They're all full of that pungent odor of disinfectant.  
So I asked if he could please do something about it!  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
She cooks homey and delicious British cuisine... But that odor ruins everything... I can't bear it anymore... (Shudder)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So that's why her food sucks?  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
...Whew. I apologize for the unsightly manner.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
A fair warning, Xuanzang Sanzang.  
I do not guarantee anything on your way from here on.  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
You will most likely not have the Buddha's protection either.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Don't worry, Ox-Demon King.  
Do you think my faith will waver because of that?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Besides, that's what makes a journey a journey!  
  
   
**Ox-Demon King:**   
All right... Then I wish you and your disciples good luck&mdash;  
  
   
## Final Volume: "Tianzhu"  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Gandhara is sooo biiiig♪ On the other side of Tianzhuuuu lies a mandalaaaa♪ Lalalaaa♪  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Where is Tianzhu anyway?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I thought we were headed west? Isn't this south?  
   
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
You're asking where “Tianzhu” is?  
It's India, of course.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
India? Oh, at this pace I thought we were going to Rome or somewhere over there.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
At the time Xuanzang Sanzang arrived in Tianzhu, Mahayana Buddhism had already perished and even the famous Jetavana Monastery had fallen into ruin.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
It is said that what precious teachings survived were left in the hands of a few monasteries and rare scriptures...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
What are you muttering about?  
Look!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
A river! The Great Golden River! We're finally here!  
Oh, dear old Ganges!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
&mdash;!??  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Namastee!? The most powerful ★5 Indian duo!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wow, what glares!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...Ugh... What are we going to do?  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
...Are they gatekeepers? Those two look like trouble. They look like they don't care a thing about Buddhism.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
More than anything, they can't take a joke.  
Well, in a way, Karna does have a sense of humor.  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
They. Underworld. Guardians.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Nezha.  
I knew you would come.  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
Understand now&mdash; Xuanzang?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...Yes, I do. Nezha.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Those two are great heroes as well as demi-gods, the embodiments of my fear...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
The fear of going to the outside world, the anxiety that I can't brush off.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I was summoned...as Chaldea's Servant.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
But since I believed I had reached enlightenment and abandoned all earthly desires I refused the summon.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
The Buddha will never concern himself with the extinction of humanity. To him, it is only one of the many ripples in existence.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
If so, it is only my selfishness as a “human being.”  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(That's why the summoning experiment was incomplete...)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(But it's probably Da Vinci's fault.)  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I don't want to leave my disciples anymore...  
I don't want to die alone anymore...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...Still. Even if I were on my own, as long as I can continue this journey, I would take that opportunity no matter what.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Sun Wukong is not here now, but&mdash;  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
...Xuanzang. I too. Give assistance.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Nezha, you?  
No, there's no need for that!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
You are the Buddha's messenger, sent to complete this broken scroll.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Or perhaps you're like a lens for me to perceive the Buddha in this hollow world.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Isn't that right, Nezha?  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
...Understood. Will. Withdraw.  
  
   
**Nezha:**   
Chat. Completed.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...Nezha's gone.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I wonder if it's possible to summon her as a Servant?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course! We needed more cheongsam Servants.  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Hey, my outfit's slit is just as suggestive!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
More importantly, is Nezha a boy or a girl?  
   
**Sanzang:**   
&mdash;Huh? Well, even the Buddha himself doesn't know much about our Prince Nezha in a Chinese dress♪  
  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Well, our latest issue has been overcome!  
I will not stop, regardless of who my opponent is!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Guys, follow me to the end!  
Let's conquer the last trial, that great river!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai... Senpai!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
&mdash;Mash!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Here, I'm here!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please answer, Senpai! I can't believe there's no reception over here, either!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, the anchor for Rayshifting has arrived!  
You can come back to Chaldea!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We can only supply magical energy for a few more minutes, though! So...please...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Come back!  
&mdash;Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
This...must be the Buddha's guidance...  
No, maybe it's your own luck?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Or...  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
The right time.  
  
   
**Sha Wujing:**   
Xuanzang Sanzang. You will remain here, on the other side, and depart again for the new land?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
&mdash;Yes. Thank you for your pointed advice.  
Sha Wujing&mdash; Li Shuwen.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Your expertise with the spear was as great as that of the Sha Wujing I know.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Your levelheadedness kept me from crying my eyes out during this journey.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
My turn. To tell you the truth, we believe in very different gods.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
But people learn a lot from each other using the opportunities given to them by the gods.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
So, even though I believe in a different god, this trip has been a valuable experience. Thank you for the rare experience.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
Oh, and all the treasures I collected during this journey... I'll put them in a savings account under your name.  
  
   
**Zhu Bajie:**   
When we meet again, I will host a big party, oink.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I'm looking forward to it.  
Zhu Bajie&mdash; Formidable King David.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Any dilemma, any situation we met, you faced with a light heart, without panicking or feeling discouraged.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I can't be like you, but I will remind myself of you when I'm in trouble.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Zhu Bajie, full of desire, who never lost that quirky personality.  
  
   
**White Dragon Horse:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;☆  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Umm? Y-Yes, right? Yes, yes! (I don't know what he's saying, but what a strong handshake.)  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
You were great to ride on!  
Next time, I'll have a saddle ready!  
  
   
**White Dragon Horse:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
And lastly...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
If I ever gain the Buddha's guidance again and manifest as a Servant in the future...  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Fujimaru... I will take you as my disciple again.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
In that case, I want to be your number one disciple again!  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Whaaaat? Isn't that a bit presumptuous? Hahaha.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
You have many people dear to you waiting for you at Chaldea, right?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
But for being a fantastic neophyte who plays a key role in the survival of humanity, I might give you that side benefit.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If that's the case, I want you to call me Master!  
   
**Sanzang:**   
That's...um, well, that depends on the merits you will have accrued by that day.  
  
   
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
...That's why I won't say goodbye.  
Instead, I will recite a blissful sutra.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
So you will have perfect health, okay?  
&mdash;Ahem!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
aryavalokitesvaro bodhisattvo gambhirayam prajnaparamitayam caryam caramano vyavalokayati...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Until we meet again!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Ending with a sutra is not really...  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai! Thank goodness!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oops... Well, that was close. Very close.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If it hadn't gone well, Mash would have mashed me.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I wonder if the others embroiled in this accident have made their way back to Da Vinci's lab?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All right, I'm gonna go and complain to that painter.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Sigh)... Shall we have some tea instead?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It seems like they found some precious Chinese tea along with the roll of scriptures.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Apparently it's called... “Records of the Journey to the Far West with Fujimaru.”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I think the tea will be the perfect complement to a recounting of your adventure.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay, leave it to me.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Recount? With pleasure.
