# Adventure of Singing Pumpkin Castle  
  
## Prelude  
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning, Senpai. I know you just woke up, but an invitation has arrived for you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Here you go. The envelope is traditional looking,  
and extremely formal.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's no return address on it but clearly this is Senpai's name on the envelope.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
From the heading, it appears to be an invitation to a Halloween party.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Halloween! Is it already that time?  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. It is, indeed, that russet-colored season now.  
In Japan, it's the time for viewing autumn foliage.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's Halloween?  
   
**Mash:**   
You're not familiar with it?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It was originally a year's end celebration in Celtic culture,  
but it changed over time to become All Hallow's Eve...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's now a celebration put on the night before people offer up prayers to saints.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Though, I haven't actually experienced a Halloween celebration...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
The bigger problem is the invitation itself, Senpai.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I happened to overhear your conversation.  
A Halloween celebration, you say?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sounds fun! I love festive events like that! Back when the Director was with us, she would never approve such things...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...That's [♂ kinda /♀ a little] inappropriate, Doctor.  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh... I guess it was. Sorry, that was my bad.  
I'll be more careful from now on.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Doctor didn't mean any harm, Senpai.  
Words just never go through his brain, as usual.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I feel absolutely ashamed... The greatest flaw of a science otaku is the utter lack of delicacy.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I really need to spend more time paying my respects to the late Director. This time I will put more time and emotion into it...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The Director is still alive.  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh?! She's alive?!  
Ah, I see. You mean she lives in our heart.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
After all, I feel the same way.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I never fail to clean the Director's Office, and I make daily offerings with her favorite dried fruit.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You know what, I think that tonight, I'll put up some pumpkin decorations in the Director's Office.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Although, Olga Marie never admits when she likes something. She'll probably say something like,  
“What are these useless things?!”  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Okay, I need to stop. It's a celebration, and here I am dampening the mood with my talk.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ahem! All right, let's turn this mood around&mdash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But really, Fujimaru!  
You're a smooth one, scoring an invitation like that!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Who could it be from?  
I certainly don't recall sending you that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I didn't send it either, Doctor.  
But if neither you nor I sent it, that means...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Undoubtedly, this is some kind of mischief. After all, letters from the outside world can't be delivered here.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In any case, Senpai, let's read the invitation.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please rest assured that it is free of razor blades or any other dangerous items.  
  
   
**Letter:**   
Dear Fujimaru,  I am writing to inform you of a splendid Halloween party that is to take place.  
  
   
**Letter:**   
My little Castle Csejte is now completely remodeled!  
  
   
**Letter:**   
You'll be swallowed up in classic and dragonic decor☆  
  
   
**Letter:**   
I hereby humbly invite you to a dream-like night of elegance and wonder.  
  
   
**Letter:**   
At the party, you will find splendid pumpkin cuisine from the four corners of the world,  
  
   
**Letter:**   
as well as a splendid serenade from an adorable idol,  
a sweet serenade from a young girl that will set your heart on fire,  
  
   
**Letter:**   
and a serenade that's sung by an unparalleled diva.  
It all awaits you.  
  
   
**Letter:**   
Indeed, it shall be a grand ball that could set any soul alight. It will surely sink its teeth into your heart and savor it as well.  
  
   
**Letter:**   
Both your mind and body will have a deluxing experience! Won't you come and bask in the spectacular sensation of being mired in a nightmare?  
  
   
**Letter:**   
The theme is, “Sweet Blood Märchen Torture.”  
I eagerly await your attendance.  
  
   
**Letter:**   
&mdash;Be sure to come, okay?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That is horrible!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The fact that she emphasizes singing three times seems unbearably sinister to me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai, what shall we do?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
 This “deluxing” is supposed to be “relaxing,” isn't it?  
   
**Mash:**   
You're right. I wonder if she wrote it out of excitement or if she didn't know what she was saying.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So this “torture” bit is...  
   
**Mash:**   
She really means “torture.” To translate it accurately, it would be “Sweet, blood-covered, fairy tale-like, and torturous.”  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
There's no signature on the invitation, but... Based on the content of the note, I have a good idea who sent it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A Servant who loves to sing... Loves to daydream...  
And also enjoys blood and torture. It could only be...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Elisabeth...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Bátho...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, you must not utter another syllable. To speak her name is to summon her, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Just as speaking the truth isn't always the best idea,  
spotting a disaster before it happens doesn't necessarily mean you can prevent it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So&mdash;precisely what are you trying to say, Doctor?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well... If you can't avoid a dangerous situation,  
it's easier to charge in without a second thought!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That philosophy has gotten me through most problems or troubles that I've encountered.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooooooou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's just ignore Doctor's advice.  
He doesn't understand human emotion whatsoever...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai.  
Are you planning to respond to the invitation?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I've...never experienced an event of this kind, so I am interested, I suppose...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, the residual Spiritron information on this letter indicates its point of origin.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You could go anytime you want...  
So what will you do, Fujimaru?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash, let's go to the party together!  
   
**Mash:**   
Of course! I look forward to your guidance and support!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
 As a matter of fact, I happen to love pumpkins.  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh dear, you're not very honest, are you? But, if you love pumpkins so much, I suppose you'd better go.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
She seems to have gathered some good materials.  
I'll join you as well.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Then let's head out to the theme park of our dreams - a Halloween party!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um.  
We should bring lunch with us, shouldn't we?  
  
   
## Section 1: Haunted Forest  
   
**Mash:**   
We've arrived. The time period is unknown but the location appears to be somewhere in Europe.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That said... It feels both a bit frightening and yet fun, somehow. How odd.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There are jack-o'-lanterns hanging all over the place,  
and all the skeletons are dancing about.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou! Fa!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's a much grander setup than I imagined...  
Perhaps I underestimated her...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes... Since this is Miss Ba...ry we're talking about,  
I thought she'd be more of a paper decorations kind of girl...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Seems like we might need to pay extra attention here.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm picking up some weak hostile signatures here and there. There's no telling what could happen here.  
Be on your guard as you investigate.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, this was totally unexpected, so it's sure to be more than we bargained for!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Now, let's go, Master!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All that glitters isn't gold, but when in Rome, do as the Romans do, they say!  
  
   
**???:**  
Leave it there... Leave it there...  
Leave some AP or stones and stuff there...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hmmph! So a ghost-type is the first up,  
I see... How typical.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's far from surprising, but well, I suppose it is what it is.  
It's the most basic of basics in a haunted house scenario.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
On second thought, this could be fun.  
Senpai, quickly now! It's time for some ghost-busting!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not picking up any more enemies nearby.  
Those must've just been some strays.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I suppose that's the quality of enemies you get right at the entrance. We need to find the real deal as soon as possible&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, shouldn't we head toward that totally suspicious-looking castle over there, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That castle... An evil castle of blood... Ugh, my head!  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I understand how you feel.  
Do you need a tranquilizer?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're in high spirits, aren't you, Mash?  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, absolutely! Uh, I mean...  
Of course I am, since this is our work and all.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I wasn't hoping it would be like going to a real theme park or anything, um, definitely not!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? ...Hmmm...  
That's odd. Maybe this gauge is broken...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor? In your professional opinion, did you notice something odd about that ghost just now?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Eh, not really.  
It was probably my imagination. Just forget it.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(A nearby tremor in the Singularity... Really. It couldn't be. Hmmm, I'll just pretend I didn't see anything.)  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You kids just go on enjoying yourselves. You'd best head to the castle first, like the invitation said.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Of course we will! Let's head for the pumpkin village just beyond the forest!  
  
   
**???:**  
Eh heh heh, eh heh heh heh heh...  
Eh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh...  
  
   
**???:**  
I...  
...'ve?  
  
   
**???:**  
fo...  
...und   
   
**???:**  
you  
☆  
  
   
**Fou:**   
...Fou?  
(Turns around, feeling a sudden cold chill)  
  
   
## Section 2: I Will Come to Your Side, I Have Come  
   
**Mash:**   
It's further than I expected, but this town certainly looks more impressive than I imagined.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What do you think, Master?  
If you like, we could pause here for a moment to rest.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That sounds good.  
   
**Mash:**   
All right then.  
Doctor, we're going to take a short break.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It'd be nice to eat some pumpkin pie.  
   
**Mash:**   
!!!  
Good thinking, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As good as being chosen by Weekly Halloween Magazine to receive the title of “This Autumn's Number One Master,” maybe?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmmm, I'm not detecting any enemies near you.  
Looks like you should be able to relax for a bit.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All right, it's time for our homemade lunch then.  
Here's to our super lunchtime!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
My, how valiant.  
In that case, shall I lay out a blanket to sit on?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, good idea. Please do.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
There you are, Master. Please have a seat.  
Here, these are homemade grilled rice balls.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
And here is some tea.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's delicious!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, you're too kind...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
By the way...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes? What is it?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What are you doing here?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Now that you mention it...  
Why are you here, Kiyohime?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fofooooou!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my, I would've thought one's wife would naturally always be at one's side.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I went to the trouble of hiding for him in a box tied with a bow, but my silly husband is just so indifferent.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Then he went and fell for that unspeakably shady invitation. As your loving wife, I couldn't sit by and do nothing.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
How odd. Somehow, it feels as though the words I'm hearing and the actual written words are fatally irreconcilable.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
And that, basically, is why I've come here.  
Fear not, I shall guard you flawlessly.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes, 24 hours a day, from head to toe, from all directions, without a second's hesitation.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Go on now, let the fanfare sound!  
For “Kiyohime is now your wife!”  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks for your continued support.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Ohhh, you're so cold!  
But it's part of your charm, eh heh heh heh heh...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, I'm overwhelmed with anxiety for your future,  
but what do you think, Mash?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
For once, I'm actually in agreement with you, Doctor...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my, it seems something is nearby. Now then, Master,  
let us hold hands and go forth on a “honeymoon.”  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That was way too forced.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Tee-hee☆  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I might or might not have heard about skulls being used as wonder drugs...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Master, would you care to use one?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Absolutely not.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No, thank you.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I suppose not.  
Shall we depart?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Heh, heh, heh...  
It seems my next guest has finally come.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Hee, hee, hee, the next guest is no one special.  
All the most important guests seem to have arrived.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Which is why this will be my very first and last love song.  
Hmm, how melancholy.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
However, I doubt this is the last fool to come.  
Oh fleeting Master, shall I just call you Oxygen?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Oxy... What?  
Truly, you say the strangest things sometimes...  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Anyways, even if this is both my first and last, that makes it all the more real for little ol' me!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
All the preparations are complete for me to make my grand entrance, right?  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Leave it to me, the food's all cooked!  
It's my seven-spice blend chicken-turkey! It's delicious!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Impressive... I hired you under the exaggerated boast that you were an all-powerful maid, but it seems you actually are all-powerful...  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Ah, but little ol' me will handle the main dish.  
Be sure to leave some for me.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Le...Leave that? Severed...meal? And... What meat now?  
Stop using all these hard words, you lizard.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
But somehow, I understood it all. It's my habit to eat every bit of my breakfast. Namu Amida Butsu.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Namu... What?  
  
   
**F：???:**  
It's a fancy phrase in Japan.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
I use it to mean, “Please forgive my brutality and depravity, for I am naught but a brutish beast.”  
  
   
**E：???:**  
...You're pretty knowledgeable sometimes, you know...  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Well, anyways.  
Has everyone been dispatched?  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Good to go. Surrounded on all sides. You'll wait here with all the grace of a proper castle master, won't you?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Yes, that way I can enjoy this banquet to the fullest.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
...  
...  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Wait, I do have some free time after all...  
Maybe little ol' me ought to go and meet them too?  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Hmm, I'll kill you then?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
I-I was just joking! Joking!  
I just thought I'd try!  
  
   
## Section 3: The Woman of Mirage  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, I'm sensing a Servant.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes.  
Make sure you stay behind me, my husband.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, did you just say “my husband?”  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I did. Why?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, um... No...  
I was just wondering if that was the right term...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
By the way, the original Japanese for husband means  
“a person who looks after you,” so I think it's okay to use for either a man or a woman.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Isn't that great, Fujimaru?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, no, no.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**E：???:**  
La-la-lah♪  
  
   
**E：???:**  
It's a lovely night, isn't it everyone? A young, sweet night. Are you a young, bitter [♂ man /♀ woman], I wonder?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I-I sense a wicked woman!  
Get back, my husband! Get a billion miles back!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yup, sounds like a great idea.  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Heh, you just want to get away from Kiyohime, don't you?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Say that again?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Nothing! Nothing!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I won't be able to come back, though.  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, you're so shy, Master... No matter how far away you are, I'll always come get you♡  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou... Fooouu...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
“This is bad, like Anchin bad...” Is that what you said?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That won't do, Fou. Even if it's something everybody knows, this is where you keep quiet.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**E：???:**  
Oh my, hehehe!  
What cute guests we have!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Welcome to our fantastic Halloween party!  
My name is Mata Hari.  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
We have quite the party lined up for you tonight.  
I hope you enjoy yourselves.  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
I'll get things started off with a dance.  
One moment... (Strip, strip)  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
!?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Doufo&mdash;u?!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wait a second!  
Why are you taking off your clothes!?  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Well, that is my specialty.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Ahhhh!  
Indecent! Filthy! Lewd!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
M-M-M-M-M-My husband! I will slay this indecent woman! How dare she show her bare skin!  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Oh my, oh my!  
Hehehe, if you prefer to do it that way, that's quite fine.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Tch.  
(Silently deactivates recording mode.)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I didn't do anything. Not a thing.  
Unfortunately, it's time for combat.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Every party needs dancers.  
Everyone, fight to your heart's content!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Is the opening act done yet?  
It's my turn now.  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Behold the power of Mata Hari, the woman with the Eyes of the Sun! ...I guess that's a good opening.  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Oh my, I lost.  
You may proceed.  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
There's still much more song and dance for you to enjoy!  
  
   
**Mata Hari:**   
Deluxe to your heart's content!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Servant Assassin has retreated.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Good.  
It appears the party's just getting started.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Should I make my wedding reception something like this?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I-I don't know...  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Get your act together.  
This isn't just my problem, you know?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'd like a quiet ceremony.  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my! I was just thinking the same thing!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I was just about to say that I didn't want a flashy ceremony!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
My, there's certainly a sense of hopeless despair in knowing that the result will always be the same, huh Fujimaru!  
  
   
## Section 4: Queen of Blood-Soaked Tomatoes  
   
**E：???:**  
Oh my...  
What a pain.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Why do I have to clean my own castle?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
This isn't... This isn't a job for nobility!  
Argh! Out, damned spot! It's not coming out!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
I keep rubbing it and rubbing it, but it's like a pig who won't squeal no matter how much you whip it!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...There she is, Senpai!  
It's the wicked witch from the fairy tales!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooouu!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Shh! Be quiet, Mash!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You seem happy, Mash.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh... Sorry, I wasn't thinking.  
We have to be sneaky, right Master?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Damn this stupid spot! I'm all out of patience!  
Take that! Phantom Maiden!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
There. Blew the whole thing to pieces.  
That'll do. Good job, me.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
I am one of the most famous vampires on the planet...  
I must be terrifying, beautiful, and merciless!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
...It's so noisy outside, though.  
How many fireworks are they setting off?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my, how ugly!  
She's like a Berserker, almost!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Look, my husband! She's not putting in any effort!  
Of course, my cleaning skill is A+++ rank.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Ahhhh!  
H-How long have you people been there?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, Kiyohime... I don't remember you having that skill.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I do. Look, I can burn burnable trash, and non-burnable trash. With my mouth.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's not cleaning.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**E：???:**  
&ndash;You saw me, didn't you?  
You saw the dark, bloody banquet of Carmilla!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Did you guys see a bloody banquet? I didn't...  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
There was a banquet! You guys just couldn't see it!  
I cooked the tomatoes!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see... That's why your nails are red.  
I was sure that's the real&mdash;Ahem. Excuse me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is a theme park of dreams.  
Only unhappy fairy tales are allowed here!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway Carmilla, why are you getting so heated over cleaning?  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
...Humph.  
That stupid girl ordered me to.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Aarrgh! Why does the Grail even exist?  
Why did I end up a Servant?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Grail? You mean THE Grail?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's in this castle?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What idiot put it in this castle!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Yes. You may not believe it, but it's true.  
Its power is what forced me to do this.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my... That must be terrible.  
But&mdash;How fascinating.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
If the Grail grants a Servant's wish, then...  
Hehehe... If I can get my hands on it...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Fufufufufufu!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fo&mdash;u!  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
...I know I can't be one to talk, but don't you think she's as dangerous as the fireworks outside?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hahaha. She's more of a landmine than a firework.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Silence, you.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
So far, I've been playing tourist, but now my goal has changed.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I'm going to defeat the mistress of this castle and get the Grail. You're okay with that, right, my husband?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Shakes head in a certain direction.)  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Shakes head in a certain direction.)  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my! You're so happy you shook your head both up and down AND side to side.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Enough talking, then.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You, Servant whose name I don't know.  
Will you lead us to the mistress of this castle?  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
You think I will?  
I, Carmilla the Vampire?  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
My role is to entertain the guests.  
Now&mdash;enjoy this blood-freezing terror!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Carmilla:**   
That concludes my warm-up.  
Glad to see you have spirit, pigs.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
After I've brought you to your knees, I'll collar you and keep you as pets.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Of course, as my slaves you'll have to clean for me!  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Now, are you ready? I'll use my Phantom Maiden to paint the walls with your blood!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, wouldn't that just make an even bigger mess?  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Grr... That stupid dragon girl with her songs and dancing... No true noble would do such a thing...  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
Hehehe, but perhaps this is for the best...  
Oh, I'm about to...  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
GYAN!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
No slacking off from your cleaning by playing dead.  
  
   
**Carmilla:**   
(Sob, sob...)  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
So the dragon girl's got the Grail, huh?  
I wonder what she wished for.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Well, I can guess.  
  
   
**E：???:**  
I see. So both Mata Hari and Carmilla have fallen.  
Are the little [♂ Puppies /♀ Deerlets] suffering?  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Of course. Life itself is suffering.  
Most people are always suffering.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
But at the same time, most suffering can be alleviated with the softness of a paw, or perhaps a tail.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
In other words, they don't suffer that much at all.  
By the way, do we have enough carrot cake?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
&ndash;I see. Then make them suffer more.  
More cruelty! More despair!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
That's the most important part of this Halloween party!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
First I've heard of it, but sure thing!  
Kitty's ready for the banquet!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Now come, little [♂ Puppies /♀ Deerlets]!  
Come to me!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
I'll give you a welcome to make you wish you were never born!  
  
   
## Section 5: Secret Joy of the Impaler  
   
**Vlad III:**   
&ndash;Hmm, so you made it this far, huh?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Carmilla went easy on you...  
Or perhaps not.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Very well then. I grant you the honor of fighting with Vlad Tepes, the Dracul.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my. We actually ran into a serious warrior for once.  
Class-wise, he's the same as me, though.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Of course, no Berserker can rival me in elegance and breeding.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
You make me laugh, man-eater.  
Your sin will scorch you from within.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Both you and I have trod a wicked path.  
Know that neither of us shall return to the light.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...That kind of ticked me off.  
You will pay dearly for that.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Of course. This is a banquet, a place for entertainment!  
And so&mdash;  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Even the jesters must give it their all.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
As the ruler of a nation, I know the importance of festivals. Man needs circuses as well as bread.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wow... He's so serious! He's the one person who doesn't get the mood for this event!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In a sense, he's a true Berserker...  
The only sane man in a world of the insane.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
&mdash;I find that a touch rude.  
I consider myself a gentleman with a sense of humor.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Mata Hari's dance was one of mirth.  
Carmilla's dance was one of suffering.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I would like to add a dance of my own, a dance of blood...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
But I must beg your forgiveness.  
I'm afraid I'm much better at embroidery.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Embroidery?  
Your hobby is embroidery?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Did you make that splendid regalia yourself?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Hahaha! How kind of you, milady.  
But no, this was the work of a special tailor.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I wanted to try my hand at it myself, but I had my position to think of.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Young girl, if you like, I shall give you a lesson later.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
An applique of a praying man would decorate your master's clothes well.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Vlad!  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
But first, we must attend to the battle.  
I've been asked to “hype up this party,” you see.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
And the best way to liven up this banquet, I believe&ndash;  
Is with your screams.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Let us begin with an appetizer.  
Eat, as your bones scream in pain!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Indeed, banquets are splendid.  
It was worth going along with that girl.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...So it's “that girl” after all?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Of course. Out of all Servants, there are few who could spread such sweet delusions without shame.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, I think there are probably a lot...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well, I'm sure there's plenty...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh my... Master.  
Your passionate gaze... It's making me blush.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, this isn't such a simple matter.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even with the Grail's power, for a Servant to summon another Servant...  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Be not afraid, foreign mage.  
We simply&mdash;answered the summons ourselves.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
What she found was only a tiny sliver of the Grail.  
It lacks the power to incinerate eras.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
She probably found it by chance during your battles at Orleans.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
It must be the blessing of God that it was entrusted to the most harmless Servant there.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...She doesn't seem harmless to me.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
She has the mind of a child.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
She's a very immature Servant who takes her childish thoughts and makes them real.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
She acts neither for good nor evil, nor for dreams or greed. She simply seeks her own entertainment.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...But that's why it is fine.  
Her entertainment is a pure joy, unlike ours.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
I know of it myself. Before I became the dragon who defended my nation, I, too, was once a father.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Now, it's time for me to fight for real.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
My stakes have found their place in history.  
And now you shall feel their wrath!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...Hmmph. Enough, I suppose.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...He's barely scratched, isn't he?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I can't believe I survived that.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Of course.  
I'm the only one who's being serious here.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I was serious as well!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Splendid, splendid. My work here is finished.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
Now then...  
Keep playing along until the end.  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
She seemed so worried about whether or not you would come.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh dear. You're much nicer than you look.  
Sure you're not related?  
  
   
**Vlad III:**   
...I'm simply taking pity on a comrade.  
It's harder than you think, always being called a vampire.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Whew, I'm so tired...  
And my throat is parched, too.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
My husband, would you happen to have any cough drops?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Here you go.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Thank you!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
We're giving each other cough drops now...  
We're practically married!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I wouldn't say that.  
I'm the one who provided that cough drop.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I see... A pity.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Either way, so far we've dealt with Mata Hari, Carmilla, and Vlad III.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
That's quite a few, but there might be more Servants who wish to join in on all the fuss...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There's one thing I know for sure.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Both:**   
&ndash;?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I've got a bad feeling about this.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Same here...  
  
   
## Section 6: Hyper Enthusiastic Maid Cat  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
RAAAAWWRRR!  
Raging Cat-Dou-Ken!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Yo! I am Tamamo Cat!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
My (temporary) Master, it's time for you to take me for a walk!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You know, you look really tired...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's tough to keep up with these people.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't worry. I'm fine.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...She just showed up without any warning whatsoever, didn't she?  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Hmph. Don't compliment me, snake-girl.  
Or shall I use your kimono to sharpen my claws?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
That wasn't a compliment.  
And stay away from me.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Hmph. You aren't complimenting me, and you want me to leave. So one of us has to die, then?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's talk about this first.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hold on a second.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Yup! We need conversation, a heart to understand!  
That's it, my (temporary) Master! You get it!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
So, I'll fill you in.  
I'm busy, so I'll make it quick.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I'm a guard. My job is to set the Halloween traps,  
and cook the jack-o'-lanterns.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, you eat those, huh?  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
It's good.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
But at Chaldea, it's only the second-best dish.  
It's just a lowly spirit, but man does it stink!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Ahahahahaha!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Dealing with her is so tiring. It's impossible to believe she's related to my texting buddy Tamamo&ndash;  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
No, maybe she's...  
Maybe she's like this at heart, too?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
The kind who will happily break the rules in a serious setting?  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
All right! It's party time!  
Here we go! It's the FINAL BATTLE!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Now, my (temporary) Master!  
It's time for pumpkin ghost pies!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Eat till you're ready to go BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
By the way, no poison in these, but here's a tip...  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
One of these pumpkin ghost pies was made by my current Master, woof!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So it's really got poison in it?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So it's Russian roulette?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I see.  
No wonder you have nothing but bad vibes!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Nwahahaha!  
I said it was just one, but I lied!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
There's actually a few more, including my failed creations! Make sure you eat them this time, woof!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Now it's time for me to join in on the Russian roulette!  
MEOOOWW!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, her purrs sound ordinary!  
I think she's getting bored!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Meow! I came! I saw! I conquered!  
Why's that hottie so fat?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You lost, Tamamo Cat.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
What... That's surprisingly white...  
How about we say I won the battle and won the war?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You lost the battle, and lost the war, too.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Then I lost everything!  
How can I face my employer?  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I know. Since I can't face her, I'll betray her!  
How about I lead you straight to the goal?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sure thing.  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Hm... A moment ago, we were trying to kill each other,  
and now you trust me? Isn't that a little too generous?  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Anyway, all aboard the Tamamo Cat Train!  
Choo choo!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're very dedicated.  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Yup. Being a guide is my real job, after all!  
Did you like that, my (true) Master?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Now, I shall lead you to the mistress of the castle,  
the mastermind who sent you the invitation, woof!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Her true identity is&mdash;  
Meh. You probably figured that out already.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hah... We finally made it, huh?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I know exactly who it is&mdash;  
but what I don't know is why.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
What is that idiot dragon girl thinking, I wonder?  
  
   
## Section 7: Melody Just for You  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Former Master! Former Master!  
Are you ready?  
  
   
**F：???:**  
J-Just give me a second! Okay, that's good, this is good,  
and that's... Probably good!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
RED LIZARD!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Who are you calling a lizard? I'm a dragon!  
I said give me a second!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
...I think we're all good!  
Okay, open up!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All right&ndash;  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Here we come!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
&ndash;Hahaha, you're here, my little [♂ Puppies /♀ Deerlets]!  
Wait, all you people came too?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Huh? Huh?  
This is&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai's...personal room?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's not this messy!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's filled with pumpkins!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**F：???:**  
You seem surprised, [♂ Puppies /♀ Deerlets].  
  
   
**F：???:**  
That's right. While you were fighting,  
I used the power of the Grail to redecorate.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Grail can do anything, can't it?  
  
   
**F：???:**  
...Come on, aren't you surprised?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
At what? I'm very surprised to see this connection to my husband's room.  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Not that!  
Indeed, 'twas I who sent that mysterious invitation!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
The beloved, blood red Caster idol, Elisabeth Báthory!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'm still a newbie idol, but I've got a bright future!  
My singing and acting abilities are (someday going to be) known worldwide!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You could say that I'm a major idol on the verge of her big break! Feel free to be blown away!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wow. (Applauding.)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, awoo, ooh!  
(Agreeing.)  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hey!  
I'm starting to think you don't mean it.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Can't you be more, I don't know, enthusiastic?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's hard when it's so obvious.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This isn't a surprise!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
No surprise?  
After all the effort I put into hiding my identity?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I had a silhouette and everything!  
I even changed my voice!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes, but you gave yourself away by using Castle Csejte as your setting.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You didn't notice that, did you? I thought not...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh dear...  
It's hard, being too famous.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Not that famous, really.  
Well, that doesn't matter at all.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It does matter!  
The surprise is ruined!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
IT! DOES! NOT! MATTER!  
Anyway, I had a question for you, Count Dracu-dumb.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Count Dracu-dumb?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Just answer me.  
...What are you after?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What am I after?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes. Why did you make us fight those Servants in the prison castle? What was your goal?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh, you don't get why?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Nope. Not a clue.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Very well. If you insist&ndash;  
I may be willing to tell you.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I bet it's something dumb.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. But let's play along and let her finish, Master.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Mata Hari, Carmilla, Uncle Vlad, and Tamamo Cat here.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
They're all powerful Servants who gave you everything they had. So now you must be tired, yes?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, yes... It certainly was a difficult battle...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
An exhausted [♂ man /♀ woman] at the end of a long journey.  
There they reach an eternal paradise, where they find&ndash;  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Where they find?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
They find happiness! That's right, the bluebird of happiness is right next to you!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Your reward for this Halloween night's dream is myself&ndash;  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
A one-night only concert, sung by Elisabeth Báthory in my little [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]'s room!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Tonight, and only tonight, I! SHALL! SING! LOUD!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Well? Surprised?  
Moved to tears? You're moved to tears, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Yes, I know what you all want to say, everyone.  
Don't hold back. Let it all out.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
U-Um, Elisabeth?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hmm? What is it?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You could have just come to Chaldea, you know...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What? Of course not.  
That's no fun.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Listen. An idol's concert is a once-in-a-lifetime deal.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You brave the winter snow and summer heat,  
lining up for your tickets.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You line up just to buy merchandise, you get packed into a crowded concert hall.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
As the diva's serenade brings you to the heights of ecstasy and madness, you fall in love!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, quite right. You're quite right, Elisabeth.  
The job of an idol in the first place is to...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, if you don't want me confiscating your laptop,  
please shut up.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, I'll shut up.  
Lady Elisabeth, please continue!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh, may I?  
Umm, then&mdash;Ahem.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
So, you see? It's important for an idol to keep their fans waiting. So...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
If I just showed up in my little [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]'s room and started singing, I'd be a heartless demon, right?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
My songs only truly shine after a long and perilous journey.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I couldn't deprive you of such a woooonnnderful feast for the ears!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So you didn't send the invitation to Csejte so that we could enjoy a Halloween party...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...but so that Master could listen to your songs?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Correct. It was a cruel trial, to make my songs all the more wonderful. Splendid, yes?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh. My. That. Is. Amazing.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Our reward. For four Servant battles.  
Is one of your songs.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
EXACTLY!  
(Dazzling smile)  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
My head. Has overheated. With rage.  
And something else.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
K-Kiyohime! Get a hold of yourself!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
M-My husband... Kiyohime is done for...  
Something within me that must never snap has snapped.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hang in there!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You can do it!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Sob... I'm telling the truth, and you're so cold to me...  
But I know that's what a Master is, now...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
That aside&ndash;You! Count Dracu-dumb!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
At this point, what's the difference between defeating four Servants and beating the stuffing out of five?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I'll incinerate the lot of you!  
No dust left! No ash left!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? Huh? Why are you mad at me?  
Argh! Don't burn down the stage!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's more of a death-y metal-y thing!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Oh, you wanna fight?  
Okay, then.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I summon the pumpkin heads I called to liven the place up! Now the whole concert hall's full!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Now, my (true) Master and my (temporary) Master!  
I'm exhausted, but it's time for the concert!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Hehehe.  
I'm in top condition tonight!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I feel like I could ignite flames of love just by meeting someone's gaze!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
My husband!  
Look deep into my eyes, please!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Splendid! Wonderful! This wasn't what I anticipated,  
but it was a lot of fun anyway!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'm really getting into this!  
I feel like my songs&ndash;can save the world!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It's time for the finale! I am Caster Elisabeth!  
&ndash;Listen to my true song!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Aah... That's enough singing.  
I'm so satisfied...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Holy Grail confirmed! Recovering!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That felt so good!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Songs truly are the noblest art, and idols are Phantasms created by the stars!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
My throat's parched, but worse, my ears hurt...  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
It's not even remotely fair that Count Dracu-dumb is in better shape than us.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
A poisonous snake can bite their own tail and still survive, after all.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Master, this wasn't quite what I expected, but we did manage to recover a fragment of the Grail.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If we take this back to Chaldea, we'll gain a valuable source of magical energy.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So all that's left to do is go home.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Or, wait. This is your room,  
so perhaps we don't even need to do that?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
My head feels so dizzy I can't think...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
&mdash;  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Hey, question for you guys.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
My (temporary) Master looks like they've got a bad case of the shakes. They okay?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?  
Oh! M-Master!?  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!  
My husband! Hang in there, my husband!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
The heat from the concert got to them...  
I understand that. Perhaps it was too good.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
No, that doesn't seem right.  
But I decided not to say so.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Are you okay, my husband?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe I'm okay?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm okay, maybe?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, the question mark means you're not lying, right?  
We still have to be careful.  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Please stay still, and rest your head, heart, and ears.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
My ears...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think something happened...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
It's because you experienced Elisabeth's concert up close... Probably.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Just think of it like trying out a torture device...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's crazy!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Good idea.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yeah.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Well, my little [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]?  
My concert was wonderful, wasn't it?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I've had my fill.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Yes, yes, you're right.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You're never going to have a private concert like this again! Probably.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience!  
Of course you've had your fill!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um... I think that meant,  
“Please, make it stop. I'm begging you.”  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Ssh! Stay quiet and she'll think this is a happy ending, woof!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Worry not, my [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]! You may have had your fill,  
but there's always room for cake!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um, what do you mean?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Y-Yeah.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
And so&ndash;  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Time for the encore! First up is my (in a sense) legendary debut single, “Love is Dracul”!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...M-Master!  
Don't die on me, Master!  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, jeez! Dracu-dumb here is unstoppable when she's singing, isn't she?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Wake up, my [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!  
[♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Good, good. Good morning, my [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What? In the idol business we say  
“good morning” no matter what time it is.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You enjoyed Halloween, right?  
I had a great time!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...  
...Umm.  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
So, um, well...  
I'm not sure if it's the power of that Grail or what, but...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...But I forgot how to get home.  
So can I stay with you, my [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You wouldn't leave a little lost dragon out in the rain, would you?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, fine...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Really? Yes! It was worth asking!  
Man, this new Master's a pushover!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What? Who am I to talk?  
Hey, I'm no pushover!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you sure about this?  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I am sure!  
I even gave up my prison castle for you!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? Then it's okay?  
You're asking me if I'll stop being bad?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Of course, I'll stop being bad!  
...Wait, did I ever do anything bad?  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Anyway, the contract is made!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I may not be an official Servant,  
summoned at Chaldea, but...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...I'll do my best to serve you, so do your best to raise me, Master!
