# Almost Weekly Santa Alter  
  
## Prologue: The Dark Santa  
   
**Mash:**   
I must say, Senpai, it's a great day for gift-giving&mdash;  
and Chaldea is in Christmas mode!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Huh?  
Senpai's gone, Fou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Are you taking a shower, Senpai?  
Or using the toilet?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
How... ...Nowhere to be found...  
But there's no doubt Senpai was in this room...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's no record of a heat signature leaving this room in the last hour either&mdash; It's as if...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Clearly, there's been some kind of foul play here!  
Let's go get the Doctor!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
&mdash;Huh?  
   
  
   
**???:**  
Emerging from the Rayshift tunnel, your eyes were met with the sight of a field blanketed in snow...  
  
   
**???:**  
A most literary beginning. The use of the second-person lends a certain subtlety to the sentence.  
Don't you think, Fujimaru?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
 That voice! Could it be&mdash;?!  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Ha! A lively response. I am possessed of a sudden desire to kick you in your arse.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Though our contract is but a temporary one,  
any Master seeking to transport me must be as so.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
 You were in the Massive Cavern?  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...No. This is my first meeting with you.  
Can you not tell from my attire?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I've certainly never been defeated by you, and have, under no circumstances, been brooding over it.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I was simply in a foul mood, especially my stomach.  
All because Archer wouldn't cook a sound meal.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...No, that is not it.  
I am precisely as you see me to be.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A mi-miniskirt... Alter  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...A m-miniskirt, you say?  
Well, I suppose one could see it as such.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
But mind it not, and allow me to say this in advance.  
One who would be Santa is unbothered by the cold!  
  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Allow me to introduce myself. I am Santa Alter.  
I am a Santa Claus of Evil who slashes apart the icy breath of Midwinter!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...You seem to misunderstand me. I merely wish to express my daily gratitude by delivering presents to all.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
However&mdash; After going through the trouble of gathering presents, I have lost my means of transporting them.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
The reindeer that I had hired previously to pull my sleigh have all run away in fear.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
What a bunch of cowards. All I did was use Excalibur Morgan as a jet engine to propel us into the stratosphere.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I could pull the sleigh myself, but such a thing would tarnish the dignity of Santa Claus.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I cannot capture the heart of children everywhere without a reindeer. Which is why&mdash; You understand, don't you, good Fujimaru?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
It is for that purpose alone that I have unsummoned you here by force.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
As a part of my daily gratitude to you,  
I bestow upon you the honor of being my reindeer.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
 This is part of your duty as a king?  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
No. I am not a king here, but a Santa Claus!  
Kindly refer to me in those terms.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You didn't have anyone else you could ask, did you?  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
That is untrue! Of those I considered there was one, at least, with promise!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
But they were rather hesitant, and worse yet,  
extremely frail. Thus, I sent them packing.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
However, their eyes were so bright they would have made a perfect red-nosed reindeer...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Honestly... Even if it is Christmastime, one should have limits to how much one lets loose.  
  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...No, wait a moment.  
It seems the presents have drawn some uninvited guests.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
And I was in the middle of my presentation...  
But there's nothing to be done about it. Take up your sword, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Your body shall know what it means to go into battle with Santa&mdash;!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
As you can see, many try to target Santa Claus.  
Reindeer must be as strong as their master.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Now then, you understand what I'm saying, don't you?  
You are now my reindeer. I won't hear any objections.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Rest assured, I am a Santa and not a demon.  
If you work hard, I shall grant you your life, at least&mdash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, ma'am, I'm ready to start right now!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yes, Santa Alter!  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Humph! That was a quick response!  
Are you a lion cub, unschooled in fear? How promising!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Nonetheless, it was a good answer. I am pleased.  
Now, let us start immediately.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
First, let us storm this house nearby.  
As Santa, I must attack from the skies.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Now, board the sleigh, Master!  
I shall enlighten you on the ways of Santa!  
  
   
## 1st Night: Little Darius  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Forward, my soldiers! Tear through the darkness!  
Plunge into the blizzard! Wander! Wander!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This sleigh really flies through the air!  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Naturally. One who would be Santa must be able to traverse the skies. We must deliver presents to the children around the world.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I've dubbed this sleigh Llamrei Unit II.  
You may relax your guard and entrust yourself to it.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why are you yelling?!  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Insolent fool!  
I am not yelling. I am singing!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
By announcing my presence this way, I can also avoid running into airplanes! It's common sense for a Santa!  
  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Good. We are approaching our destination.  
Prepare yourself, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
The return address of this “Dear Santa” letter is in Persia. A request from Darius, aged 3.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...Hmm. The writing is so black and smeared I can't read it at all. Well, I'm sure once I see his face, I'll know what present he'd like.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Let us go! We shall enter from this magnificent chimney!  
  
   
**Lu Bu:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!  
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Ahh... The iron lament that surpasses the vocal cords...  
Echoing from the depths of the hollow, the enamored yet hate-filled voice of a young girl's lingering affections as she “sings” of death...  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Specifically, I should call it the raging moans of a girl who can no longer abide her hunger. Ahh, how unsightly yet adorable&mdash;!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Though it's a far cry from my own taste, she conveys her feelings so well it truly pains me.  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
A cry that would pierce Heaven itself. You who spews forth such hatred, I'd liken you to... Yes, a carp swimming up a waterfall.  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Actually, you are more like a carp banner. How auspicious. Ahh, how very auspicious indeed...  
And hateful, too!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Christine! Christine has gone so far from me! Why?  
Why does fate endeavor to tear us apart yet again?  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Couples! Christmas! Santa Claus! Whenever I hear that this is a night for loved ones, it makes me sick!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Don't you agree, Sir Carp Banner? Why must we, upon such a night as this, be a company entirely of men?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...What a ferocious cry from the soul. It stirs the heart too greatly. Surely, that Servant is an actor of some renown.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
 Yeah, that was quite an elegy.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
 Ehh, it was certainly a self-indulgent soliloquy.  
   
  
**Santa Alter:**   
What a splendid performance. He probably has more passion in his pinky than that cursed Tristan...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...But I can't imagine that either of them is Darius.  
Also, that object in the middle of the floor...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
There's nothing here but that tree-like candle in the center of the room. Does that mean Darius isn't here?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
That's fine, then. I should simply turn around and leave now, but I do pity these two.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Merlin has said that when a man is widowed, his suffering surpasses the pain of Death. As Santa, I can't just leave them be.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Let us go, Fujimaru!  
We shall be like the Christmas Carol that saved Scrooge!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Bow down, little ones!  
Prepare to receive your presents from me!  
  
   
**Lu Bu:**   
[[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]???  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Oh, Christine!  
You've come back to me, Christine!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Ugh. Halt, Black Mantle!  
Do not approach my reindeer.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Laying hands upon your audience is a third-rate performer's action. Are you not a world-class actor after all?  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
What? I, a world-class...actor, you say?  
I, the specter of this miserable underground hovel?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I never engage in flattery. You rave as though mad,  
but your cries are filled with truth. So much so I am moved to tears.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
But more importantly, where is the master of this castle?  
The sender of this letter to Santa should be here.  
  
   
**Lu Bu:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Santa... Ahh, Beautiful One, what tragedy is this?  
Now that I look more carefully, you are, indeed, Santa Claus!  
  
   
**Darius III:**   
Ohh... Oooohhhh!  
Santa... Santaaaaaaa!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
?! This candle tree moves?!  
You two, just what is the meaning of this?  
  
   
**Lu Bu:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Die, please. Repent! And surrender what's in that bag!  
Santa Claus is the one who should be struck from this world!  
  
   
**Darius III:**   
Oooohhhhh!  
Presents! Gimme!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Well! Only naughty little children try to take things by force like that! We've no choice. Prepare to fight,  
Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
After all, it is also Santa's duty to give dreamy-eyed children a cold jolt of reality!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, but I don't see any “little children” here!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Santa's more violent than I'd imagined!  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Minor details. Worry not!  
All one really needs to be Santa is to hand out presents.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Not even Picts, and raising such a ruckus indoors?  
Such poor manners. It's Christmas. Take this fight outside!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Have you learned your lesson, ruffians? The form of Santa Claus pleases me greatly but it is only a temporary one.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
My true form is that of Britain's Red Dragon,  
Altria, the King of Knights. Remember it well.  
  
   
**Lu Bu:**   
[[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]...  
...(looking dejected)  
  
   
**Darius III:**   
Ohhh... Santa... Claaaus...  
Santa... Claaaaauuss...  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Anguish... Anguish... Anguish...  
When I think of what we've done... Oh, the anguish...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Doesn't he look a little odd?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Well, Your Majesty, don't welook like the bad guys here?  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...Yes, it is starting to feel that way to me as well.  
This being my first job, perhaps I got a bit too hot-headed.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
You there. You understand the speech of these other two, correct? Is that tree Darius, aged three, by any chance?  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Yes, he is... His king is, in fact, the green light that burns in Hell, the Lord Cyalume... And who might you be, my lady?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I already told you I was Santa Claus.  
Now, accept your presents.  
  
   
**Lu Bu:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!  
  
   
**Darius III:**   
Ohhhh!  
Presents! Gimme!!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
There, there.  
This is for you.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Since you would die before you could ever use a Noble Phantasm, use this to amass a little motivation, or perhaps a little love.  
  
   
**Lu Bu:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!  
  
   
**Darius III:**   
Hurraaaaay!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
As for you, Black Mantle, I shall give you... Yes, this.  
  
   
**Phantom:**   
Oh! This is the very thing I have lost! My love, my light!  
Christine! You've brought her back to me!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
As I said, do not come near my reindeer.  
We are busy. We have a mountain of work to do.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Let us go, Fujimaru. Santa should be as a passing breeze. We must not stay long.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
And it is painful to have to leave a party early, since my hunger is never satiated.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Well, then&mdash; Farewell, little ones!  
Let us meet again next year! Merry Christmas!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
All right. They were the perfect companions for some light warm-up. Now it's time for you to work, my reindeer.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
From now until the end of Christmas, many more battles await us, I am sure.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
At each stop, gather the stockings and bring them to me.  
Stockings are the crystallizations of the hearts of children seeking presents...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
It is by the power of such magical energy that Santa Claus traverses the globe. In other words, you could call it our fuel.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
The more you gather, the greater the reward I shall bestow upon you. Remember that as you go about your work.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
The next “Dear Santa” letter is on the 2nd.  
Let us build up our party until then!  
  
   
## 2nd Night: Her Name is Little Marie  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Good work with your reindeer training. You're fighting Christmas monsters when you have time, right?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Thanks to your efforts, the fuel for my sleigh...  
The Santa Points have been building up nicely.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Now I can deliver the next present.  
Good work, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Let's go over this one more time Christmas celebrates the birth of a certain person.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
It is the mass of Christ, hence the word Christmas.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
These days, Christmas Eve is December 24th,  
and the 25th itself is Christmas.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
But the original period was much longer. His birth was celebrated for days, reaching its peak on the 25th.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
In other words, beginning my advance this early is Santa's old way of doing it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're doing it the classic way.  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Of course. Function follows form. Destroying everything thoroughly is the classic way to win.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Advance? Like a military advance?  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I see our destination. Give me your magical energy, Reindeer!  
  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
This “Dear Santa” letter is from Marie, a girl who lives in France.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Two of her friends are always fighting, so she wants a present to bring them together, it says.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Humph. How stupid.  
Santa only grants one's own wishes.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I have no presents to bring happiness to other people.  
What does this Marie think Christmas is about, anyway?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sounds like a mistake Marie would make.  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
That's right. If she wants to bring them together,  
she should pick a present herself.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
She should do what I did. I once sent two knights who were fighting a single horse, and told them this...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
“This is for the one who thinks they're better than the other.” I knew this would test them and form a friendship.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
It worked perfectly. They stopped arguing in front of others. Although they were trying so hard not to snap at each other when they smiled, but oh well.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
That was Agravain's idea.  
Aggy always gave me the best advice.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sounds like a mistake you'd make.  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I'm not making any mistakes.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Santa brings gifts.  
She does not bring happiness.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Whether the gifts bring happiness depends on if the little ones have been good or not.  
  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...Hmm? This should be the insertion point...  
But it's a snowy field.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
The French Marie is without a doubt a member of the royal family.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I was expecting her Christmas party to be nationwide chaos, with mountains of expensive turkeys...  
  
   
**???:**  
Found you!  
That's your last airspace violation, Santa Claus!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
What!? We're 2,000 meters in the air!  
Don't you think that's crazy?  
  
   
**???:**  
That's my line!  
What's with that hippo sleigh? Are you kidding me?  
  
   
**???:**  
Also a date in the sky with Master was going to be my thing! Don't steal it from me!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is that eagle...bird?  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
That's a hippogriff, Reindeer.  
It's often mistaken for a griffin.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I mistake them often myself. Neither is as good as a dragon, so don't waste time remembering.  
  
   
**???:**  
ARGH! Don't think that firepower equals strength!  
How short-sighted can you be?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wow, that's so cool!  
   
**???:**  
Huh...it is? Am I... Cool?  
I'm used to being called cute...  
  
   
**???:**  
...but “cool” is new. You're making me blush... Hehe.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...Maybe I'll crush them. More specifically,  
I'll smack you hard right between the legs.  
  
   
**???:**  
Humph. I don't like that kind of sexual prejudice.  
That's not a weak point for me anyway.  
  
   
  
   
**???:**  
Hmmph, target sighted!  
Marie, up here! Fire everything you've got!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
What!?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
We've been hit!  
Grab on, Reindeer! We're crash-landing!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Tch. They shot down Santa Claus!  
Is this the French way? I knew I shouldn't trust them!  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
That's my line, you suspicious woman!  
Go back to Santa Claus village!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh my. That's rude to Finland, d'Eon.  
The fault lies entirely with this wicked Santa.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Hehehe. I've never felt so violent before.  
It's exciting! Shooting a cannon is fun♡  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Not interested in negotiations, huh?  
You're after my sack of presents, aren't you?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Very well. Santa is destined to be a target for thieves.  
I'll deal with you before I go see Marie.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Let's go, Master!  
We can ride that merry-go-round after we're done!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
...Huh? Do I have the wrong person?  
Maybe Astolfo's got bad eyesight...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
It doesn't matter. Tonight's a festival night!  
Little problems will melt away with the snow.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Vive la France!  
My dear, gallant Santa, do you like snowball fights?  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**d'Eon:**   
...Such amazing bladework.  
This couldn't be Santa, could it?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh, didn't you realize when the fight started?  
This isn't the same Santa Claus as before.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
I-I'm sorry... I wasn't thinking straight...  
But my queen, if you noticed then why didn't you stop?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I'm sorry, but I wanted to keep the momentum going!  
You had fun too, didn't you Santa?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Of course. It's good to revisit one's childhood.  
I'm sorry for being so rough with your knight.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
By the way, that well-bred dog...  
Are you perhaps Marie?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Yes, I am Marie.  
You read my letter, didn't you, Santa?  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
(Dog... That Chimera was a dog? That definitely wasn't a papillon, but if the queen says so...)  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
I'm here! ...Wait.  
Is the fight over already? I don't get to fight?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
So this is everyone, huh? It seems there was a misunderstanding, but it's solved now.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I'll give you your presents then.  
Line up, you violent children.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Okay!  
Come on d'Eon, Astolfo, let's line up!  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
Huh? ...I get a present too? Are you actually a nice person, even though you don't look like one?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
That last part was unnecessary.  
You and I should get along. You have my respect.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Men's attire in France is really elegant, isn't it, Knight?  
Give me more details later. I like those frills.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
I am not cross-dressing!  
I am a man as you can see!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...You heard them.  
Anything you want to say, Hippo?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Why are you asking me?  
What's wrong with a girl dressing like a boy?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
People should wear the clothes that suit them.  
I think d'Eon's letting clothes run their life, though...  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
You're too free-spirited! You, Roland...  
Are the 12 Paladins filled with nothing with perverts?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Huh?  
Comparing me to Roland isn't fair!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
He's the type who wind up in handcuffs.  
I get my name in the papers!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I'm glad you're all getting along.  
Let me see...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
This is for you, Marie.  
I hope it gives you inspiration for the Merry-Go-Round.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh my! A glass horse!  
Thank you, Santa!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Next is the Knight. You get this.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
A m-maid?  
Why do I get a maid outfit? Am I supposed to wear this?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
It's a message to at least make better food than the cat.  
That is, if anyone will take you at this point.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
I'll be single for the rest of my life!  
Even as a Servant!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I see. I think we'll get along well there, too.  
Give me your contact info later.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...Now then.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
...(Excited)  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Let's go, Reindeer.  
Farewell, and see you next year!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
H-Hold it&mdash;!  
What about me? What do I get, Santa?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Nothing! He who does not fight shall not get presents!  
You were too lazy to save Orleans!  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
She's got you there.  
Even Atalante showed up as an enemy.  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
What!?  
That wasn't my fault!  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
The France chapter ended a long time ago!  
That means I couldn't possibly&mdash;oww!?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh my. I guess Santa gave you a present after all.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
A Halloween pumpkin...  
What does that mean?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Um... Maybe that I'm cute like a pumpkin?  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Aww, she said those mean things but she actually loves me... Tehehe.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
No, I think she's saying you're an idiot who was late for the party. This is a Craft Essence that's past its expiration date.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh, I get it! It means  
“You won't be in anything until next year's Halloween.”  
  
   
**Astolfo:**   
What? &mdash;I-M-P-O-S-S-I-B-LE!  
That can't be right! I'll be back sooner than that!  
  
   
## 3rd Night: Heartbreak☆Jean Kay  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
So here we are. This time our “Dear Santa” letter is from Jean Kay, address unknown.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I guess she makes a living as an assassin, so has no specific address. Right now she's hiding in those caves.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you talking about Jing Ke?  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
It's Jean Kay, I think. How am I supposed to know how to pronounce it, I don't speak Chinese.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What did she ask for?  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
The mental fortitude to remain calm in adversity,  
and a pair of easy-to-draw double daggers.  
  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
By the way, Fujimaru.  
Do you hear that strange sound?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
It's like someone's repeatedly hitting heavy meat with a blunt object, or endlessly pounding a bag filled with sand.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I've got a bad feeling about this.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...I can guess who that is.  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
You're pretty perceptive. I wouldn't have guessed.  
...Well, once we go inside, we'll find out even if we don't want to.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
This time it's a cave, so there's no chimney here.  
We'll go in through that door in the front.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Hahh! Hahh! Whew!  
What's wrong! With people! On Christmas?!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
They say it's about celebrating His birth, so why!  
Are all these couples! Exchanging presents!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
No, it's fine. It's fine, Martha.  
Showing your beloved how you feel is a good thing.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
The problem is! Wimps! Who can't even ask a girl out!  
Unless it's on Christmas!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
And His birthday was October, anyway!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
And why are they playing!  
Sappy pop songs! On a day! Like this!?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...It fell. No, it snapped.  
The chain holding that sandbag just snapped.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I saw   
   
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
You've got that right, Martha. If someone wants to send presents, they can do it any time.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I went and got the enemy general's head for my brother the instant the idea came to me. He refused it for some reason, though.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
...My Lord said something similar, actually.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I went hunting monsters, and they said they wanted a demon's heart, not their head. “Stop that, it's scary,” they said.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Hehe... Both them and my brother want so little.  
It's such a virtue to be so not-greedy.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I think they said something about needing eyeballs a while ago.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
If they want me to do it, I'll pull all the eyeballs off a Demon God pillar, but...  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Unfortunately, I've been given no such order.  
I wish they'd give me some kind of mission...  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
...so crazy that it could make you shiver just hearing about it...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Fujimaru, do you know that woman who doesn't know how to work out her stress problems,  
or the loyal dog with the broken brakes?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Well, it doesn't matter. Excuse me!  
I'm told Jean Kay is here!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Huh? Who's there!  
How long have you been there?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Since just now. I mean it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I saw nothing. I saw nothing.  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Reindeer is right.  
We're here to see Jean Kay.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I'm not at all interested in the things you were saying that would freak out Master if they heard them.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
&mdash;Ahem. So you're here for Jing Ke, right?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Welcome to this distant cave, which normally no one should ever visit.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I can see you're two... Um, two travelers, right?  
Please, sit down.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I'll get dinner ready. Once you have some warm soup,  
please kindly get out, okay?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
No need for that. Once we're done here we will leave.  
Where is Jean Kay?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
You mean Jing Ke?  
Oh, she's...  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
What's up?  
Did somebody call me&mdash;?  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Oh, looks like we've got more company!  
Hey Martha, are you going to cook?  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Add in an order of seared beef, too.  
Some sea turtle soup would also be great!  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Everything you make is delicious, Martha. I don't know why the world's men aren't banging down your door.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
You're so lazy! All you do is lay around and you never help with the cooking.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
If I had my staff I'd be teaching you a lesson, Jing Ke!  
What happened to the normal, gallant you?  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Aww. C'mon, just make it! Pretty please!  
I really like the meat dishes you make!  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Yukhoe? Is that what you call that stuff? Those thin slices of beef you eat raw. It's so good with wine!  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
But how do you manage to grind the meat without a blade?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Wha&mdash;t is this?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Definitely a drunk!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Definitely a cutie!  
   
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Hmm? Ushiwakamaru, did you get smaller?  
What's with the black clothes? Going to war?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I'm sorry, honored guests.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Jing Ke began drinking to recover from a traumatic event, and that was ten days ago. Now she's totally toasted.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I see... She couldn't wait for me, huh?  
I should've come here first. Forgive me.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
But don't worry. Santa Claus is here for you,  
little drunkard... No, I mean office lady!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I've come to deliver your present!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
What? Did you say Santa Claus?  
Now that you mention it, you do dress like one...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Heh, you've got guts. What makes you think you can just come back and... Never mind.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I'm gonna smash up your face!  
Get ready, you villain!  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
What? Another Santa? Give me a gift card for a good yakiniku place! I want some beef tongue!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I knew they'd attack us!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What did Santa do?  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...Looks like this is starting to make sense.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
There's lots I want to ask, but it can wait until after the battle.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
You young ladies who want to spend your Christmas having a party in a gloomy cave&mdash;  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
This is a royal order! Once I beat you, go try and find yourselves boyfriends!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
I lost&mdash;!  
So close! I just needed nine more steps!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
I give up&mdash;!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Tch... How could I lose twice to this thief...  
Is it the staff? ...Am I not cut out for a staff after all?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Hmph. You've finally calmed down, huh?  
You seem to have it out for Santa Claus.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Something happened, right? Tell me.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
What do you mean? A Santa Claus came here before.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
When I said, “Yay! Presents! Santa, I want a new set of German cooking knives!” and got all excited...  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
...That Santa made us sign some weird form and then put our stamp on it...  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
...and the next thing we knew we were forced to buy expensive presents with our own money...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
That's not all. When they found out we didn't have enough money, they confiscated our stuff!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
What is that? Some kind of new sales technique?  
When did Santa Claus turn into a shady company?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
That's impossible!  
Santa Claus is a friend to children everywhere!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...But it seems your story is true.  
As a fellow Santa, I am upset.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That Santa must be a fake.  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Come to think of it... Santa Alter's wearing black.  
I didn't realize that she was Santa Claus at first.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
But the other Santa looked just like you'd expect Santa Claus to look.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Santa Alter is a good evil Santa Claus.  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Hmm. That's a complicated way of calling her.  
So, is she good or bad?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...A dark Santa, huh? One that gives awful presents to bad kids.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Kids might think she's a mean Santa, but objectively speaking, she punishes evil kids so they'll mend their ways.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
That's not true at all.  
I just give people the gifts they need.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I have no intention on lecturing anyone.  
If you want one, you can ask an Avenger.  
  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Anyway, I'm sorry that happened to you. Let me see...  
I didn't expect to need presents for three people.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
You, cold-looking woman. This is for you. The real one isn't here, but if you have this with you you'll find it.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
A-A ship? I might be able to do something with a small boat, but a ship this large...  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Well, whatever... If I sneak aboard at night and take the boss out first, the crew will all belong to me.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
That's a dangerous thought. As expected from a genius dog like you. I can see why your brother has such trouble.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Next...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Huh? I get something too?  
You show compassion, even to those you fought?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I'm sorry. I misjudged you.  
You are pure-hearted, and a real Santa Claus&mdash;  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
This is for you. You like these, right?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh my.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...Wait a minute! I don't need this!  
Why would a Saint want to get buff?  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Hey, what do I get?  
Don't I get a present?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Of course. You get this, Jean Kay.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
This talisman will help you do your job elegantly,  
and not panic in front of your target.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHA!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She loved it!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...She thinks it's funny?  
   
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Wonderful! I love this bearded guy&mdash;!  
Wow. That kinda got me. That hit me right in the kokoro.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
I'm gonna go assassinate this guy&ndash;! He's got a face that just makes you want to stab him from behind&mdash;!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He was already assassinated...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's crazy...  
   
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
...I'm sorry. Jing Ke almost never gets drunk,  
but when she does she's like this...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
She's been drinking ever since that Santa Claus got her... It's understandable.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Hmm... This Santa Claus was good enough to deceive tough-looking girls like you, huh?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Well, it doesn't matter.  
My job is done here.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Let's go, Fujimaru!  
To the next set of troubled children!  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
They left, huh?  
She turned out to be a good Santa, but...  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Why was my Lord wearing a reindeer costume?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
No, it was very cute, so it was a good Christmas present for me.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Y-You think she's just into that?  
That's how Riders are. Anyway&mdash;  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...I don't see Jing Ke, do you?  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
Oh.  
  
   
**Ushiwakamaru:**   
&mdash;Okay, it's too late!  
Let's forget about the bearded gentleman!  
  
   
## 4th Night: Penname, Daddy-Long-Legs  
   
**Emiya:**   
The keel's done for! It'll break any moment now! Isn't it time a certain someone took responsibility for this mess?!  
  
   
**Robin:**   
Don't look at me! This isn't my fault! This whole thing was supposed to be the two of us going on a fishing trip!  
  
   
**Robin:**   
Being equally matched at hunting in the woods, we were supposed to take our contest to sea, so to speak.  
That's when&mdash;  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
That's when&mdash; A certain idiot stowed away on our boat and waited for his chance while the two of us were busy in the hold.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
And saying how he wanted to meet the ladies of the Southern Lands, steered our boat straight out to sea!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Isn't that right?  
  
   
**Emiya/Robin:**   
“King David!”  
“Old Man David!”  
  
   
**David:**   
Hmm... It's one thing when young ladies call my name...  
But having it shouted by you gentlemen is rather unpleasant.  
  
   
**David:**   
Now, you two. Weren't you ever taught that you must respect your elders?  
  
   
**David:**   
By the way, I'd rather like to return to the shore now. What do you say?  
  
   
**David:**   
What? The sail got broken and we ran out of our magical energy?  
  
   
**David:**   
Then this is an emergency!  
Quickly, you two! Jump into the water!  
  
   
**David:**   
The boat can still hold my weight if I'm alone.  
The magical energy stored should hold out too! It's simple math!  
  
   
**Robin:**   
Arrrghh! It's no use, I am about to snap&mdash;! Old man,  
how can you act so high and mighty at a time like this?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
That's how every one of the Kings of Old behaves!  
In fact, I can think of one who's like a walking mass of arrogance...  
  
   
**Robin:**   
Wah! This isn't the time to stand around glaring at each other! Let's hurry up and toss some cargo overboard, at least!  
  
   
**Robin:**   
If we get done in by something like this, we'll be the laughingstock of the Servant World!  
  
   
**David:**   
The Servant World? So that's how you refer to it?  
That's good to know. Thank you!  
  
   
**David:**   
Then in that case, may I ask who the current top comedian is there? I'd like to know for future reference.  
  
   
**Robin:**   
Oh, probably that one girl... The one with the dragon wings and the horns growing out of her head.  
  
   
**Robin:**   
There are lots of other talented ones too, but they fall short of her.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
What are you babbling on about? As of now, I'd nominate the three of us for the biggest stooges!  
  
   
**David:**   
Oh yes, I'm sorry! That reminds me, do the two of you know the tale of Carneades?  
  
   
**David:**   
When a ship sank upon a stormy sea, one man was fortunate and survived the wreck by clinging to a small piece of driftwood.  
  
   
**David:**   
But there was another fortunate man who survived as well, and he swam toward the first man. Therein arose a problem.  
  
   
**David:**   
The driftwood was large enough to keep one man afloat,  
but with two, it would certainly sink. Thus, the man&mdash;  
  
   
**Robin:**   
Hey, Red Mantle! What do you say we lighten our load by one person right now? Then you and I can continue our contest afterward!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
For once, I agree with you, huntsman!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
This is a good chance for us. We can compete to see who's the better Archer right here and now!  
  
   
**David:**   
That saddens me. Nothing ever comes from contention...  
And, it's already known that I am the superior Archer...  
  
   
**David:**   
But I suppose if I were to knock you off the boat defending myself, none could blame me for it. So I shall join in your contest!  
  
   
**David:**   
Despite my appearance, I was a King of many victories.  
I must warn you that I am skilled. Extremely skilled.  
  
   
**David:**   
If there were a ranking of “Most-Victorious Kings” in the Servant World, I assure you, I would occupy its top spot.  
  
   
**Robin:**   
Oh, is that so? Fine by me. Killing kings is what I do,  
so I'll put you out of your misery now!  
  
   
**???:**  
Most-Victorious King? Superior Archer?  
Hmph. You 3-Stars certainly talk a big game.  
  
   
**Robin:**   
!!! Look above!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Hohoho!  
Step aside, you're in the way of my landing!  
  
   
**Robin:**   
...And who might you be?  
We were in the middle of something just now, you know?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
The invincible Santa that descends upon Christmas like this storm! That is who I am.  
  
   
**Robin:**   
Huh? Santa? Really?  
But wait! The sky? You came from the sky?  
  
   
**Robin:**   
Meaning, you have some means of getting off this boat?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Naturally, I do. Due to this storm, I have left my sleigh and reindeer waiting for me above the clouds.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
A proper Servant must think upon their Master's safety.  
Isn't that so, Red Archer?  
  
   
**Robin:**   
Oh-hoh! Is this Servant an acquaintance of yours,  
Red Mantle?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
&mdash;(remains silent with an unreadable expression on his face)  
  
   
**David:**   
Abishag! It's you, Abishag! O Beautiful One, there can be no doubt that you are my Abishag!  
  
   
**David:**   
Ohh, to think that we would both become Servants and meet again like this! I am truly blessed!  
  
   
**David:**   
Come, warm this chilled body of mine as you did in the past. Come, hesitate not.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
You are mistaken, King David.  
I am Santa Alter, not Abishag.  
  
   
**David:**   
??? But with beauty such as yours you must be Abishag.  
Ah. Perhaps you do not recognize me as a youth?  
  
   
**David:**   
I was an old man when I took you as my wife.  
But fear not, for my heart is as true as ever it was.  
  
   
**David:**   
Be I shepherd, king, or aged man, I declare that the contents of my mind, at base, are ever unchanged!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Oh? That is well, then. In that case, you were of sound mind when proclaiming yourself the “Most-Victorious King”?  
  
   
**David:**   
Huh? Uh, yes, I suppose that...  
I was indeed powerful in war.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Fool... You've dug your own grave...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Then I shall see your strength tested.  
Gift distribution can wait till after.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
En garde, Archers!  
This sword shall rectify your arrogance!  
  
   
**David:**   
Sorry, one moment, please! As I, personally, am not terribly powerful, won't you assist me, gentlemen?  
  
   
**Robin:**   
Huh? Are you completely mad?  
All we want is to catch a ride on that flying sleigh...  
  
   
**Robin:**   
Though she just might do our bidding if we defeat her.  
If it's a fight you want, I will gladly comply.  
  
   
**Robin:**   
A Saber-class challenging Archer-class Servants to a fight. This won't even be funny.  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Robin:**   
Gwaah&mdash;?! Man, I messed up... Now that I look closer, you're actually a Rider-class, aren't you?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
You have an Archer who attacks with a staff.  
A Rider who attacks with a sack of presents should be fine as well.  
  
   
**David:**   
Hahaha! Well, there's no comeback we can make to that.  
That said, my Noble Phantasm is pretty Archer-like though.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Ahem. I assume we're all calmed down now?  
Why, exactly, did you come here, Santa Rider?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Fool. I did not come here at my own behest.  
I came in response to a “Dear Santa” letter.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...I see. I have a pretty good idea who the sender was.  
I'll bet he asked for jewels to delight his many wives with, right?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Really, writing letters to Santa as a full-grown man...  
What a problematic adult. Seriously.  
  
   
**David:**   
Yes, seriously problematic.  
One should limit one's childish dreams.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
What? King David... Um.  
Pardon me, but wasn't it you?  
  
   
**David:**   
Of course it wasn't.  
The only one I send my prayers to is our Lord in Heaven.  
  
   
**David:**   
And anyhow, isn't the idea of Santa Claus a bit scary?  
It's nothing but trouble to receive gifts from someone who wishes nothing in return.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
If it wasn't me and it wasn't King David,  
that means&mdash;  
  
   
**Robin:**   
All right, all right! It was me, okay? I sent it!  
Call it a temporary fit of madness&ndash;!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Don't be embarrassed. All are equally accepted in the eyes of Santa Claus. Especially you in the green. You have worked hard.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Your method of supporting your Master from the shadows rather than coddling them is most praise-worthy. Though a tad under-handed.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
In contrast, you in the red. You spoil your Master too much. What are you, the mother of an exam student preparing for Exam Day?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Uh-uh! I object strongly to that!  
I'm not at all overprotective...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
These presents are for you two.  
Accept them gratefully.  
  
   
**Robin:**   
!!!! Black Key Assortments?  
  
   
**David:**   
Wow, what an impressive-looking sword!  
(rather half-heartedly)  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Don't get too happy yet. Your real present is being prepared elsewhere. I sent word ahead of time, so it should arrive soon.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Farewell, then.  
Keep your fights moderate during Christmas times!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
She comes and goes like a storm.  
I didn't even realize the real storm had passed.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Ah, well. At least this means we won't have to listen to the tale of Carneades now.  
  
   
**David:**   
What? Who spoke of Carneades' tale as an example to follow? That's horrendous. Let us put that man to death.  
  
   
**Emiya/Robin:**   
It was you! You haven't learned anything since the Uriah incident, have you?!  
  
   
**David:**   
Now, now. No matter how strained the situation, I am not the kind of man who would be so insensitive as that.  
  
   
**Robin:**   
...Maybe we really should just toss him overboard?  
We'd be doing his Master a favor, don't you think?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...Agreed. His existence will only be a bad example.  
Let's just say King David went back to Okeanos.  
  
   
**David:**   
I apologize, it seems your words were true. I know I am wrong now, please forgive me. Our Lord in Heaven says so, too.  
  
   
**David:**   
Rather, why don't we reflect on our battle just now?  
Despite our loss, don't you think the three of us make a good team?  
  
   
**David:**   
Nameless One, with your AOE Noble Phantasm.  
And Faceless One, with his single-target Noble Phantasm.  
  
   
**David:**   
And I, using aggressive evasive tactics to avoid harm,  
sealing the enemy's special attacks before they are launched.  
  
   
**David:**   
Even humbly speaking, wouldn't we be a rather invincible team? We should become friends, shouldn't we?  
  
   
**Robin:**   
Hmm, that's true enough.  
We wouldn't have any blind spots as a team.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
True. We wouldn't be the most powerful team, but we're all elite Archers. With the three of us combined, there'd be no enemy who could&mdash;  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hi! I received your order and have come accordingly!  
This is the location of the special Christmas concert, right?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Ugh, a Lancer?!  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
According to the client's order, since we are floating out at sea, I can let loose and sing as loud as I want...  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I won't let anyone escape me tonight! Now let's jump straight into my opening number, “Love is Dracul!”  
  
   
**Robin:**   
Ah, this is the end. We're all going to the underworld with that AOE Noble Phantasm...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
It seems the Home-Delivered Concert from Hell has begun.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Heh! Those accursed Archers, will drop like flies.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
 Welcome back, Santa.  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Th-thank you. So you've learned to give Santa a proper greeting after all? You seem to be understanding your role as a reindeer better.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
 Did something happen down there at all?  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
What? I merely sent them an event worthy of Christmas.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
After all, they were wondering who the top comedian in the Servant World was at present.  
  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
In any case, that concludes our detour.  
Our next “Dear Santa” letter&mdash;  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...comes from Uruk, from a boy named Gilgamesh?!  
  
   
## 5th Night: Little Gilgamesh  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
This is the address of our next letter-sender, but&mdash;  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
My letter should be arriving soon. Not that I normally take any notice of Christmas or whatever it is&mdash;  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
That wretched Saber is sure to dress in that manner of getup. Such frivolity... Who would've thought she would answer to such needs so faithfully.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
It is praise-worthy for a king to endeavor to meet his subjects' expectations. Even I could perhaps learn from her example. But of course, I won't.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
No, that is not the vital point in this. What I should truly take note of is the institution of Christmas!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
It is said that however reserved and modest a woman can be, on Christmas, she cannot help but speak the truth of her heart!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Ahh, I can't imagine any future but one in which she will confess her feelings for me! Very well. I shall allow it! Thank me for the good service!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Now, come quickly, Dark Santa! I shall make you understand our difference through my treasury!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fwahahaha! And then, perhaps I will say something like,  
“You, yourself, are my Christmas present, aren't you?”  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
We're leaving, Fujimaru.  
This house appears to be empty.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
 Yes, indeed.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
 Yes, indeed.  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Reindeer! We have the night off thanks to Gilgamesh's grand delusions.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
And we happen to be floating above a great city.  
What don't we enjoy ourselves in its entertainment quarter?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Though there are but rustic eateries here in ancient Uruk,  
they should have good, simple food to dine upon.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I, myself, favor that dish of wheat flour mixed with water and stuffed with various fillings that is then baked upon an iron plate and then basted with sauce afterward.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
   
I imagine even you could make something like th&mdash;  
What?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
We've been encapsulated by a strange space!  
Don't leave my side, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
!!! ...Where are we?  
This does not appear to be a normal place...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...Pardon me... Hello there.  
Miss, are you Santa Claus?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
You are Santa, aren't you?  
I mean, you're carrying all those presents, after all.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Yes, I am Santa. And what manner of beings are you?  
Are you the ghosts that haunt this place?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We...are not ghosts or phantoms, I think...  
But I don't think we are human either...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Yes... Neither Jack nor I really know what we are...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
We didn't have names either...  
All we could do is lie here and look at the town...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
But tonight, um...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Since it's...Christmas...  
We were thinking we'd like something warm too.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...Yeah. That's why, even though we knew that it was wrong...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...we forcefully summoned you here “inside” ourselves.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...I see. You must be the unfulfilled spirits of young girls.  
Your lives ended while still innocent, and ignorant of love.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I see you've gained a sense of self under the light of Christmas. ...Though only due to your sense of loneliness.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
We aren't that complicated.  
But Alice only had memories of the hospital, so...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
What? Well, you only had memories of a dark sewer,  
Jack. I don't think that's a good thing. Not at all.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
That's why... At least for one day today, we...  
We wanted to feel “chosen” by someone too...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...I see. So you've never had your names called,  
or have never been chosen by another?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
&mdash;Upon this extraordinary day, the two of you felt that you, alone, were not special?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
 This sounds like a job for Santa Alter.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
 Aren't you going to give them presents?  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
That I cannot do. I cannot give presents to any who have not written me letters.  
  
   
**Jack/Nursery Rhyme:**   
...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
However! If you wish it from the bottom of your heart,  
declare it! Wanting something just because you're lonely means nothing!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
You should want something because it looks like fun, or simply because you want it! There, now. Show some courage!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
O&mdash;Okay.  
T-to be honest, we...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
We want to play like everyone else does!  
We want a dream that's more fun than this!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Please, Santa Claus!  
Please give us presents too!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Well spoken. I shall answer to this courage. If you have no letter, then come take your presents by force!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Apologies for keeping you waiting, little ones.  
Now, let us begin this merry party!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jack/Nursery Rhyme:**   
Aww... We...lost...  
I guess there won't be...any Christmas for us...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Augh&mdash;!  
I&ndash;have&ndash;been&ndash;defeated&mdash;!  
  
   
**Jack/Nursery Rhyme:**   
...Huh?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Well fought, my brave little ones!  
As promised, I shall now give you Christmas presents!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Ms. Santa!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Ah... Ohh...  
Presents... So many presents!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Santa!  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Your face says, “So you do have some good points,”  
Fujimaru. ...Of course, I do. I am the ally of all children.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
 Alter-chan!  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Do not call me, “Alter-chan!”  
Know your place as a reindeer and show some restraint!  
  
   
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Thank you... Thank you, Santa Claus! But is it really okay for us to have so many presents&mdash;?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Th-that's right... Aren't there many other children waiting for their presents too?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Heh. You needn't worry about that.  
I have only one more stop to make.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
What's more, these are merely the spoils of your victorious battle. Now, what shall I give you for your actual, individual presents&mdash;?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Here, take this!  
These are the presents I have chosen especially for you!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Ohh... Ohhhh&mdash;!  
This... This is...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Hurray&mdash;! It's a reindeer&mdash;!  
A humongous, humongous reindeer&mdash;!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Two little girls running in gleeful circles around Asterios...  
Heh! That's what a proper Christmas should be.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...So you already had a reindeer,   
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Fool, that one is only for show. If Asterios were to start running, lightning would streak the sky.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Which would frighten all the little children.  
The best thing for this prince is to have him do nothing.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Should we go call Euryale?  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Certainly not. If that wicked goddess were here,  
she would turn these pure, young girls into demons!  
  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...In any case, our work here is done. Even if it is only a dream for one night, enjoy yourselves heartily.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Ah... Wait, Santa!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
...Thank you.  
Never mind me, but thank you for granting Alice's wish.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Yes, thank you, Santa, and thank you, Jack.  
Even though I was scared at first, the party was fun!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
&mdash;  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
But I'm glad. It was only because we waited patiently like the fake Santa told us to...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...that we got to meet the real Santa Claus.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
&mdash;Wait.  
What do you speak of?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
...Right. Before you came here, another Santa Claus came too. But...  
  
   
**Jack:**   
...while that Santa was talking with us, they suddenly said, “Uh-oh. This won't do!”  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
“Since I'm not the real Santa Claus, I won't be able to fulfill your wishes. But the real Santa Claus is sure to show up soon.”  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
“Please be good girls and wait patiently until then. What? If you can't do that, I'll try to do something for you next year.”  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
And after saying that, that Santa disappeared somewhere. She may have been a fake, but she was a cool Santa too!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Well, good-bye, Santa! And Santa's reindeer!  
Thank you for bringing presents all the way out here!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...A fake Santa. I'd been ignoring it, but now it seems a showdown is inevitable.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Before I deliver my final present, I must punish this insolent cur. Fujimaru, next up - a showdown!  
  
   
## 6th Night: Fake Santa, Caesar  
   
**Caesar:**   
Welcome to the snowy fields of the final showdown!  
Of course, I was the fake Santa!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
&mdash;(Tired Sigh)  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
W-What's with that sigh? A duel in a blizzard should be incredibly exciting!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Now, let me answer all your questions!  
I'm ready!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Why did I become Santa Claus?  
Why is Caesar so plump?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
What kind of beauty was Cleopatra?  
What's the present going to be on the last day?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Everything! Everything! My swift tongue shall melt away all your anger and doubts!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Shut up, you red igloo!  
I've no interest in your babbling!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Igloo? Oh, those houses they make out of snow.  
I stand strong against adversity, so it's a good metaphor.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
But are you sure you can't wait just a little?  
Don't you want to know the story?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
No, you should learn the whole thing!  
It was on a starry night, when I went to Darius' castle.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
He mistook me for Santa Claus, and became very happy.  
I had no choice but to take his things.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That makes no sense!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why didn't you have a choice?  
   
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Am I supposed to tell someone who's overjoyed to see Santa that they've got the wrong guy?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I could do not that, for I am Caesar.  
But I had no presents to give out.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
So I borrowed things from Darius.  
So I could use them as presents, you see.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Though I did have Phantom, who just happened to be there, sign off as the buyer.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you a demon!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What did Phantom ever do to you?  
   
  
   
**Caesar:**   
But in the end, I was just a temporary Santa Claus.  
I couldn't give them what they truly wanted.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Unable to bear their sad crying, I crossed the river and the next thing I knew I was in France.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
There was a very pure-hearted knight. She... No, he?  
No, She? Anyway, I did my work there, too.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I heard they wished to sell their old possessions and I bought everything they owned.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I was fortunate to have the funds from Darius.  
One of their possessions was a treasure of the French Royal family.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
They begged me to return it,  
so I sold it back to them for ten times the price.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
“Are you really a famous spy, d'Eon?  
Maybe the enemy just lets you go because you're cute?”  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I couldn't bear to see the Queen bullying her like that.  
She was almost in tears.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
So I went to the mountains and hid, where I found an oriental beauty plotting to assassinate an Emperor.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
“This time, the Emperor shall die by my hand&mdash;”  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Could any man not be struck by the sight of her meditating beneath that waterfall?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Fortunately, I'm half an emperor myself. I told her I could give her good advice, and persuaded her to lend me her daggers&mdash;  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Enough! Silence!  
You're a walking fraud machine!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Humph. I'm a victim too, you know.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Everywhere I go, people call me Santa Claus!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I'm a general and a politician. You could say it's my job to live up to people's expectations.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Thus, even if I knew I was fake, I had no choice but to play the role. Though I did have fun.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
By the way, do you know why they all think I'm Santa Claus? I have no idea.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I mean, you look just like...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Surprised you survived this far, actually.  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...I see.  I'm forcing myself to wear this embarrassing outfit, yet you don't have to do anything for children to love you...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I have no choice but to kill you!  
For the sake of the world, and Santa Claus!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Hahaha! That's the true Santa Claus for you!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
To be honest, I was getting tired of being mistaken for Santa Claus and having to run away!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then stop causing trouble!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You can't live without making trouble, huh?  
   
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I'm bored, though!  
Nero and Caligula won't play with me!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
And Cleopatra is avoiding me! How can I be Caesar if I don't cause trouble for all these lovey-dovey couples!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you just have a grudge against people!?  
   
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Hahahaha! I guess you found me out!  
It's time to fight, then!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
If I defeat you, I will take the presents, and become the True Santa, that's fine with me!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
The throne of the rare Servant shall be mine!  
Now hand it over, Dark Santa!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Caesar:**   
Humph... The wind...stopped...  
Is this the end...of my battle?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
But...it's not so bad... It was hard for me, too...  
After falling at the hands of the true Santa, I can finally...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mr. Caesar...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mr. Igloo...  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
&mdash;Humph.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Jump!  
Hahaha! That was close! The snow is so slippery!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
He moves around so fast...  
He's like a seal on ice!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I'd prefer you called me a dancing snowman.  
Hmm, but I can't stop. I can't stop!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
My plan to take over the role of protagonist and grab the star of glory is ruined!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
But this is for the best!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
The star of the festival should be a beautiful Servant,  
not someone like me!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Farewell Dark Santa! Farewell Reindeer! The Christmas nights are at an end, and the 25th is upon us soon!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Gather stockings, and a Christmas Eve miracle shall be yours!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...He rolled all the way home, huh?  
We won't be able to catch him.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
But this solves the problem. The fake Santa is gone and will never deceive people again.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't think we're done with Caesar...  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...True. To be honest, when I heard “fake,”  
I was imagining a different Roman emperor.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
There's another Red Saber...  
Someday, I'll have to settle things with her.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A Christmas Eve Miracle?  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I-I wouldn't know.  
Forget it. It's for your own good.  
  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Fujimaru, there's one night left.  
There's still one Dear Santa letter.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I look forward to finding out what kind of child awaits us.  
  
   
## 7th Night: Attack! The Alter Next Door  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
At last, it's time, Fujimaru.  
Tonight shall be our last and greatest work.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
The last “Dear Santa” letter is from an Alter, address unknown.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
An evil Servant, crawling in the abyss of a curse...  
In other words, like me.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Her present request is for  
“A board game everyone can have fun playing together.”  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
It's a game like the Japanese sugoroku, where you roll the dice to advance your piece, and buy up properties on a game board.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
The players buy land, charging tolls and usage fees to strip the other players of their fortunes and become rich.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
There are many ways to clear the game, but the most common is to reach a certain amount, or bankrupt all the other players.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Below us is a Servant who would desire such a game.  
Exciting, isn't it?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Let's go. Don't forget to smile.  
Don't forget to pray. Don't forget to be sadistic.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
As Evil Santa Claus,  
it's time for me to perform my last job!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I have arrived!  
Santa Clause descends to the sound of jingling bells!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&mdash;This is awful. This is the worst.  
The worst possible woman who could've come.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jeanne d'Arc Alter?  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I thought it was just that disgusting Servant,  
but you're here too, huh Fujimaru?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
What does a pure-hearted Master want with a fallen woman like me?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
L-Lovely Christmas decorations!  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
How?  
What part of all this is luxurious?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
The spirits did this on their own.  
It's not my taste. I would've used a burning stake motif.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Or what? Will you be my straw doll Fujimaru?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
A straw doll, crucified and burning.  
I like that. It's enticing.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
If you will, I'll forget about what happened before.  
It won't matter, because you'll be dead!  
  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Don't you dare bite my Master, rabid dog.  
You're the one who sent me a letter.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Heh&mdash;I was shocked when I saw the name on the envelope. A girl who's nothing but hatred towards what is good, making a wish?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Also, the handwriting was very easy to read.  
I thought you couldn't write.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I studied! Is that bad!? Those scribblings I made were so ugly it made me retch.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Heh. That's just like you,  getting rid of anything you don't like.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
And why does it matter if they're ugly?  
No one will see them.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Humph. You're not thinking hard enough. I'm a perfectionist. You know, if you sign a contract with bad handwriting&mdash;  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Enough about that.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Why are you calling yourself Santa?  
Bring out the real Santa.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Are you blind? Or just stupid?  
I've brought many presents to children.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I may not be a Saint, but I'm a real Santa Claus.  
Fujimaru's trust is proof of that.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
The reason I started this was to fling this present in your face, but now this is my real job.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I can't be a Saint, but I'm not a fake.  
Right, my Reindeer?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Santa Alter is a real Santa Claus.  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Indeed. You may deny my words, but not those of Fujimaru. Right, Dark Jeanne?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Santa Alter is a veteran Santa.  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I don't know if there are veteran Santas.  
But maybe you're right.  
  
   
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hah&mdash;  
I see. This is an elaborate way of pranking me, huh?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You probably thought I was spending Christmas lonely by myself, right?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
But too bad! I'm having fun every day!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I've got so many wonderful friends here with me!  
  
   
**Pierres A to G:**   
“Help me!” “Help me!” “Help me!”  
“Help me!” “Help me!” “Help me!”  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
A horde of spirits?  
You haven't been using them to&mdash;  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That's right! We're all having fun playing a board game!  
Games are fun! Games are great!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
The weak endlessly trod the path of the weak,  
and the strong endlessly take from the weak&mdash;  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Stealing the flesh and blood off the other players as they scream and cry is wonderful.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Yes&mdash; I am in first place by far! I have the most capital! Monopoly is fun! Monopoly is great!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Hmm? It doesn't seem like that much of a difference...  
There's about a 10,000 dollar difference between 1st and 2nd place&mdash;  
  
   
**Pierre D:**   
“Help me!”  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He just took the lead.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Jeanne owes Pierre a million dollars...  
   
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Oh, I'm sorry. My hand slipped.  
Let's start over. Too bad!  
  
   
**Pierre D:**   
“Help me!”  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...How wicked.  
You haven't repented at all, have you?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
You'll never make any friends like this, and you definitely won't get to be a Servant.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Humph. I don't want to be a Servant.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I don't need a Master.  
Why would I want to join you, anyway?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...I'm fine being alone. I'm fine being alone.  
I should atone for my sins all by myself.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I don't want anyone's help&mdash;least of all the help of Fujimaru, the one who defeated me.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Jeanne Alter...  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Oh, are you sympathetic? Or disgusted?  
It doesn't matter. You're annoying me anyway.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You need to play the game fair, though...  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
How rude. I play fair!  
Wait, is that what you're thinking about here!?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I just used Jeanne Rule #3:  
Jeanne gets to do whatever she wants three times!  
  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I guess nothing we say matters...  
We'll have to fight.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That's just what I want. Pierres, get ready.  
You want to work off some of that stress, right?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Torture them. Just like the trials you gave to me in life! Torture them slowly!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Humph, by the way... I've been wondering,  
but did you forget how to talk like a Saint?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Oh, I haven't forgotten. This is just for today.  
I mean, you wouldn't want me using fancy words, right?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Can't you tell? I'm trying to match you. I'm trying to use words your puny, violent brain will understand!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
It must be hard. I understand your pain.  
I recognize your frustration myself.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Because I was trying to match your level, and it's been making me want to throw up.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you're both good friends!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're both Alter!  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter/Jeanne Alter:**   
Would you shut up!?  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Humph. I guess that's all you can expect out of spirits.  
The only ones I can rely on are Gilles and the wyverns.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
So, what will you do? Keep playing?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I spend my days doing nothing but cursing at the bottom of the Earth. I'll fight as much as you like.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She hasn't changed at all...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She hasn't learned a thing!  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
That's right, Fujimaru.  
The battle will continue until we defeat her mentally.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Losing won't teach her anything.  
She'll just try and claim we never won.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
This particular child needs an especially nasty punishment.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...What?  
Do you have some kind of trump card?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Of course. Will you still talk about staying down here forever after you get this present?  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&mdash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, her expression changed.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah, I kind of know how you feel.  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
How does it feel to look at your light... Light?  
Well, I guess it's light.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
This is what will happen if you stay down here.  
At this rate, there might even be Jeanne Lily.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&mdash;I'm going back to purgatory.  
I've got better things to do than play here.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I'll build up my Spirit Origin and become a Servant,  
and next time I'll impale that stupid wannabe Saint!  
  
   
**Pierres:**   
“Oooh!” “We're free!” “We're free!”  
“We're saved!” “Thank you!” “Thank you!”  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Oh, but first, I forgot something.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Let's go, Bishop. You're going to help me with my trials in purgatory, okay?  
  
   
**Pierres:**   
“Help me!” “Help me!” “Help me!”  
“Help me!” “Help me!” “Help me!”  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...All right. That's the last of the Dear Santa letters.  
We've handed out all the presents.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
My job is done.  
Good work, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I couldn't have finished this without you.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Without you, I would've given up after the first person.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...I may not look it, but I get bored easily and have a short temper. I'm sure you didn't notice.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, yeah.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sure, yeah.  
   
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I like that. It's good for a Master to be able to get along with their Servants.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...Hmm. So even that's not enough to get my point across, huh? Fine. Get on your knees and lower your head.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I will point my sword at your shoulders, but I won't cut you. Just bear it for a moment.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
&mdash;Once again, I recognize you,  
Fujimaru. I won't forget what has happened over these last 10 days.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
You are my knight, my follower, and my leader.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Please keep your light shining into the future.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...Now then, the time has come, it seems.  
Our busy Christmas is over.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
I have one final present for you.  
A justly deserved reward. Take it.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
...In other words, a new fighter.  
I don't need to say anything more, do I?  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Chaldea's system has its flaws, so you'll have to start over from scratch. But that's all right.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Thanks to its flaws, and its vagueness, so many encounters are possible. It's a good thing.  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
My blade is with you!  
You can ride on my sleigh any time you want!  
  
   
**Santa Alter:**   
Farewell, my Master!  
&mdash;Merry Christmas!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, it's Senpai!  
They suddenly appeared in an unoccupied bathroom!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What&mdash;!  
Did that bathroom have a hidden room or something?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
My head feels... Weird...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think I saw... Santa...  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Good, you seem like you're okay.  
Oh, but this is&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai is REM-REM-ing and looking very tired.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Is that right? Long-term Rayshifts are mentally draining,  
so it's good to get a lot of sleep, but...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, their health looks okay.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I was worried when you grabbed me and told me Chaldea was in trouble. I'm glad it was nothing.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And disappearing only to reappear later is quite the Prestige! It'll be a great trick for the party!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Party?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wait, is today  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, it's Christmas, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Everyone's waiting for you in the conference room,  
Christmas cake in hand.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Master?  
Is something bothering you?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nah. I've got a funny story to tell you later.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I look forward to that. I was a little worried it would just be Da Vinci's magic tricks.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There are only a few days left in the year. Our battle continues, but for tonight, let's enjoy Christmas!
