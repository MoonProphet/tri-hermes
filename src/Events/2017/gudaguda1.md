# GUDAGUDA Honnoji  
  
## Prologue: The Warring Era of Heroic Spirits  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
An intruder in Chaldea!  
Again? Where are they from?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
They seem to have directly entered from a different phase space. But this response? I wonder what this is.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, is it an emergency?  
Oh, Senpai, good morning.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You look cheerful again today.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, of course. It's good to be cheerful.  
I also had a delicious breakfast today.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I think you're acting a little too calm!  
Greetings are important, but for now, intruder!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What was breakfast?  
   
**Mash:**   
Fried eggs, seaweed, and miso soup, with stewed pumpkins for dessert.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Even rationing out what little we have stored, I believe this was a frugal yet complete meal.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Pumpkin, huh. We did harvest a lot, so there is an excess of them.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No wait!  
Intruder, the intruder!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh my, I'll go intercept them right away.  
Senpai, please do the honors.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The response was from around here...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash, behind you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wh&ndash;?  
  
   
**H：???:**  
Nobu nobuu!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
?!?!?!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wha&ndash;?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Huh?  
   
  
   
**H：???:**  
Nobu nobuu!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What is this thing?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Be careful, Mash. It may look like a joke, but it's displaying high combat capabilities.  
  
   
**H：???:**  
Nobbuu!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master!  
Look out!  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Stop right there!  
  
   
**H：???:**  
Nobu!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
W-Who are you?  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Nice to meet you. I'm from Shinsen&ndash;  
Uh... Let's see... Just call me Sakura Saber.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sakura... Saber?  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
Yes. I materialized in this world to pursue that mysterious creature...  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Wait, wait, man-slayer!  
Don't leave me behind!  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Sheesh, my normal self could take them out like it was nothing, but this is rather hard on me...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
U-Um, the two of you are?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Hmm? Me? I am the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Nobu&ndash; No, Demon, right! I'm Demon Archer!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Demon Archer and Sakura Saber...  
I see.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If I could interrupt, I figured out where that thing spawned. It's a different phase space that collided with Chaldea.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We have to destroy the source of the problem.  
Or else, Chaldea will be filled with strange creatures.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I finished calculating the coordinates for the Rayshift.  
Go in there and get rid of them quick!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood! I'll hurry over with Senpai!  
Um, by the way, what will you two do?  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
We're hoping to do the same thing you're trying to do.  
Please let us come along with you.  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
If that's okay with you?  
Archer?  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
All right, all right. Well, it is our problem and I've grown tired of chasing after them...  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Very well! The Demon King of the Sixth Heaven,  
Demon Archer will lend you a hand!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyway, once you all Rayshift, I'll lock the system down.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There. Now we can have some peace of mind.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
By the way, those two Servants...  
How did they directly materialize into Chaldea?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm, it looks like we got connected to a strange space by an astronomical probability.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Look at the conditions they're Rayshifting into. What's this? Phenomena Corruption from another phase space?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
In any case, it's pretty terrible.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wow... What's this? A group of strange creatures, and something else? They're not quite Shadow Servants...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Either way, I believe Fujimaru will be able to do something about it&mdash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&mdash;Now it's time for me to go back to bed.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm sleepy because I was sending messages to Magi☆Mari till really late last night.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You kept sending her messages and she just kept yelling at you... Is that some sort of punishment?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's not a punishment, it's a reward!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Though, I need to take a nap or something to reset my mind and regain my footing...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? It's you, Fou. You were left behind? Eh?  
You had a bad feeling so you didn't want to go?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Rayshift complete, but...  
Where are we?  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
It seems the Imperial Holy Grail lost control and created a separate dimension within this phase space.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Imperial... Holy Grail?  
What is that?  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
We can talk later.  
They're coming!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
The Grail&mdash;is out of control?  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
Yes. There was a Holy Grail War in our world,  
but the Grail was tampered with by some strange technology.  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
At the end of all that tampering, its power got out of control...  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Unfortunately, I got involved in the accident and my subconscious materialized.  
It's starting to&mdash;corrupt reality.  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Worst of all, it took away most of my power. Originally I should be OP like a Last Boss, but now I'm like a 0.5 star Servant...  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
In short, I got nerfed to a level 1 noob.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Star?  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
With my power, I should've been a 5-star character.  
Why did it end up like this...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So you're one of those...  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
I'm sorry our Archer is causing you so much trouble.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
So that indescribable creature is the manifestation of Demon Archer's subconscious and power?  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Y-Yeah. I don't quite understand it myself,  
but that seems to be the case.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How irresponsible...  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
This has nothing to do with you,  
I'm sorry that you've gotten involved.  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
It's basically all Archer's fault, so please complain to her as much as you want.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It only has one eye...  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
I-It's only being hidden by hair, yes?  
See, it's just like Mash over there!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Don't lump me in with that thing!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
By the way, I found this during the earlier battle.  
...A bowl? Perhaps? And a steel pot?  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Looks like the magical energy leaking from the Grail copied what's “valuable” in my mind.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Valuable? A black pot and an old bowl...  
They don't look like they're that valuable...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Mash, can I have a look at them?  
Hmm, hmm...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
What is this? Such dusty looking vessels are valuable in the Far East?  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Rude Westerners! Rikyu will punch you for not understanding value in the simple and subdued!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, even if you claim this is valuable...  
Wait, now that you mention it...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
&mdash;I'm curious! These tea set-like things?  
My workshop will take them!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're interested in them?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Just look at this black, unsightly teapot!  
Quality iron, smooth to the touch...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...But is super dull in shape and color. Still, I feel like it has an indescribable charm, or maybe not so much?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's what she meant by “simple and subdued!”  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Oh, you are quite knowledgeable.  
I'll make you some tea later.  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Let's see, I'll rent out an entire temple somewhere...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Won't it explode?  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
No, no, there is no way a teapot could ever explode.  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
You think so?  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-In any case, let's head towards the center of this Singularity.  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
We somewhat forced your hand for assistance,  
but I hope we can work together well.  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Right! Let's go, everyone!  
On to the journey that will unify this nation by force!  
  
   
## Act 1: Sneak Attack!! GUDAGUDA Okehazama  
   
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**   
All right, we'll set up camp here! Ben&ndash; I mean,  
Sessai, prepare for a banquet. In two seconds.  
  
   
**Musashibou Sessai:**   
Two seconds? Oh I'm sorry, right away!  
Please don't put your hand on your blade.  
  
   
**Musashibou Sessai:**   
However, my lord, camping in a place like this is dangerous. Don't let your guard down.  
  
   
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**   
I am fully aware of that. After all, I'm a genius.  
I don't mind danger and stuff.  
  
   
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**   
If we're attacked, we wake right up and attack back.  
Enemies can't easily approach an army this size to begin with.  
  
   
**Mini-Nobu:**   
Nobu nobuu!  
  
   
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**   
See, this mysterious creature says so, too.  
Ben&ndash; I mean, Sessai, you worry too much.  
  
   
**Musashibou Sessai:**   
I see...  
I hope nothing serious ends up happening...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like some Servants are bringing those strange creatures along with them...  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Hmm, it seems they brainwash Servants summoned by the Holy Grail, and then they put those Servants to work...  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
Those do look like Heroic Spirits, but something's odd.Maybe some unnecessary factors got mixed in during their summons.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In any case, it'll be difficult to fight an army that large.  
What should we do?  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Indeed, this calls for&mdash; a night raid, of course!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Night raid?  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
That's right! It's the best way for a few to attack many!  
By the way, when I was young...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's like Okehazama!  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
You study hard, I'm impressed! Yes, with that battle I revealed my intention to unify the nation!  
  
   
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
I'll catch the enemy's attention. Everyone, ambush the main army when you get the chance!  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Listen to me!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sakura Saber, will you be okay going alone?  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
Despite my looks, I'm used to dealing with large groups,  
and those trivial enemies can't possibly defea...  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
Kugh?! (coughs blood)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Whaaaaaat?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A-Are you all right!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
MEDIC!  
   
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
D-Don't be alarmed...  
This is simply a skill of mine...  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
Sometimes I'm unable to act, or I'm defenseless before an enemy. That's all this ability does...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What kind of useless skill is that?  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
(Sob) After all, I'm a useless soldier.  
Who made the Bakumatsu like that?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I see, that's pretty fatal!  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
It's not as if I like having this skill!  
I can't remove it even if I wanted to!  
  
   
  
   
**???:**  
Hmm?  
Who's making a fuss over there?  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Come on! See, now they found us because you were making so much noise!  
  
   
**Matsudaira Arash:**   
Are you the insolent bunch after Lord Yoshitsune?  
You have some nerve attacking an army this large.  
  
   
**Matsudaira Arash:**   
...But I respect your courage! Therefore I, Matsudaira Arash, the vanguard of this troop,  
  
   
**Matsudaira Arash:**   
the best archer in these seas&mdash;no, the best archer in the Orient! &mdash;will rain punishment down on you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I am so confused right now!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Matsudaira Arash:**   
This isn't good...  
But it's not over yet...  
  
   
**Matsudaira Arash:**   
I will show you...  
This attack has all my body and soul poured into it!  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
I've got a bad feeling about this...  
Looks like there's a lot of power going into that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-Anyway, let's run away!  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
Everything's a mess right now, but we have no choice.  
Run!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where can we run to?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But that's...  
   
  
   
**Matsudaira Arash:**   
It's impossible to run from my bow.  
Its range is 2,500 kilometers!  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
That's not a bow anymore!  
  
   
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**   
The moon is nice tonight, Benkei...  
I mean, Sessai.  
  
   
**Musashibou Sessai:**   
You ended up saying my whole name, my lord.  
The moon is indeed lovely, but still...  
  
   
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**   
Strange people seem to be approaching us...  
Do you know who they are?  
  
   
**Musashibou Sessai:**   
I wonder if they're the patrol that Matsudaira sent out.  
  
   
**Demon Archer :**   
Move, move!  
Get out of our way!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sorry, we're going to pass through here!  
  
   
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**   
...They're gone now.  
I wonder what that was about?  
  
   
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**   
So, Benkei... I mean Sessai.  
There's one more thing I wanted to ask.  
  
   
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**   
Did we shoot off some fireworks during the feast?  
  
   
**Musashibou Sessai:**   
No, I didn't hear about that...  
  
   
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**   
Then what's that light streaking across the sky like a shooting star...  
  
   
**Musashibou Sessai:**   
It's shining brightly, like a shooting star indeed.  
  
   
**Matsudaira Arash:**   
Stella&mdash;!  
  
   
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**   
Th-This can't be. This huge army, in an instant...  
Forgive me, brother, but our dream of resurrecting the Kamakura shogunate is...  
  
   
**Imagawa Yoshitsune:**   
Ah, please stop trying to hit me with a rice spoon from beyond the mountains... (snore)  
  
   
**Musashibou Sessai:**   
That's why I told you not to let your guard down...  
Anyway, let's get out of here while we're still standing...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All enemy Servant signatures have vanished...  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
Well, this is kind of...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What a mess...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's Stella for you...  
   
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
It can't be helped!  
  
   
## Act 2: Dashing!! GUDAGUDA Three Line Formation  
   
**Takeda Darius:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!  
  
   
**Sanada Medusa:**   
Finally the time has come to settle the score,  
Fool of Owari! ...So my boss says.  
  
   
**Takeda Darius:**   
[[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]&ndash;!  
  
   
**Sanada Medusa:**   
Bare your corpses before the Takeda Cavalry.  
...So my boss says.  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
But it looks like you're just riding an elephant...  
  
   
**Takeda Darius:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!  
  
   
**Sanada Medusa:**   
Don't worry about the details. It'll make you go bald!  
...So my boss says.  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
You should be the one worrying!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Takeda Darius:**   
[[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]&ndash;!  
  
   
**Sanada Medusa:**   
L-Let's plant our flag in Persia.  
...So my boss says.  
  
   
**Sanada Medusa:**   
Oh, I'm done here?  
Yay...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
W-We managed to defeat them... But it seems like Rider wasn't really that interested in the first place.  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
It seemed like my famous cavalry-killing Three Line Formation didn't do that much to Rider?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Uh, well, that's...  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
Now that you mention it, it seemed like arrows hurt more than usual...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's just your imagination.  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
Speaking of classes, we haven't heard of yours, Mash.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You wouldn't see one in a normal Holy Grail War, but...  
I'm a Shielder, and we focus on defense.  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
A class focused on defense. That's unusual.  
But, your chest does look squishy enough to repel anything I throw at it.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Affinity matters, doesn't it?  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Now that you mention it, Mash doesn't seem to be affected by affinities.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right! I'm a Shielder, so you can leave all the defense to me!  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
I'm kind of jealous since I've got a fragile body.  
Are those boobs the secret to defense?  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
That part doesn't matter!  
  
   
**???:**  
Behold! I am the true god of war, Uesugi Altria!  
Takeda Darius, it's time for our fated duel!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A new Servant?  
Master, get ready for battle!  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
What? Uesugi? ...Wait, you're a girl? The Dragon of Echigo can't be a girl! Go back and start over!  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
I don't think we can say that...  
  
   
**Uesugi Altria:**   
No, there are theories saying I could be a girl...  
Anyway... Where is my fated rival, Takeda Darius?  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
Huh? He got eliminated just now...  
  
   
**Uesugi Altria:**   
What! I came all the way from Kasugayama just to fight,  
and it was all a waste...  
  
   
**Uesugi Altria:**   
I wanted to take Kai's food and eat to my heart's content...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Please leave.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The Warring States economy is so cruel.  
   
  
   
**Uesugi Altria:**   
Oh... Well, that's just how it goes!  
For my food... No, for my people!  
  
   
**Uesugi Altria:**   
I'll take your rations instead!  
I have the divine protection of Vaisravana on my side!  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
The Warring States period really was like this!  
What a pain!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Uesugi Altria:**   
I can't believe I lost... It must be because I stopped myself at only three bowls of rice this morning...  
  
   
**Uesugi Altria:**   
By the way, this is completely unrelated,  
but I think my shadow is getting...thinner?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That was a tough battle, Senpai.  
All the Servants seemed kind of strange...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, they did.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You just noticed?  
   
  
   
**E：Demon Archer:**   
It seems like when they were summoned, factors of the generals I considered my enemies were mixed in.  
  
   
**D：Sakura Saber:**   
So it's your fault again...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is bad! Fujimaru, Mash!  
Get away from there immediately!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What? What's going on, Doctor?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, I was a bit groggy when I woke up, and was just casually looking into that space's composition...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...when I discovered a certain particle spreading there.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A fascinating, funny particle that infects Servant spirit cores, causing bad stuff to happen!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wh-What was that?  
What kind of “bad stuff” are we talking about?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Weakened status, modified memories, damaged spirit core. But out of everything that could happen this is the worst...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
“You become a disappointment!”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? A disappointment?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, a disappointment.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
N-Now that you mention it, there was that Uesugi and that Imagawa from before...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is bad, Senpai!  
We need to get out of here before we go kaput!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're going to go kaput?  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right!  
We can't go kaput!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We might end up like that weird creature!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash has already been contaminated...  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? I-Is there something wrong? Anyway, let's go take a bath and wash it off or something!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? It doesn't seem like Sakura Saber or Demon Archer have changed at all...  
  
   
**E：Demon Archer:**   
Hmm. We haven't changed at all...  
  
   
**D：Sakura Saber:**   
I'm my same old blood-coughing self.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, maybe you two were already a disappointment to begin with.  
  
   
**Archer & Saber:**   
What? (x2)  
  
   
## Act 3: Predicament!! GUDAGUDA Encircling Net  
   
**Shimazu Sétanta:**   
So I guess it's our turn now...  
But why do I have to be teamed up with you guys?  
  
   
**Chousokabe Emichika:**   
I know it's a Servant's job to obey once summoned,  
but I would have loved the chance to refuse this time around...  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
That's what I wanted to say! And what's up with this weird space? The flow of magical energy coming from the Grail is really strange.  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
The Grail's being used for something unnecessary again.  
Don't you want to have a proper Holy Grail War?  
  
   
**Chousokabe Emichika:**   
As expected of a witch from the Age of Gods.  
You've seen through this trickery?  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
Of course.  
...Not that I can do anything about it, though.  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
You know how there's supposedly a familiar made from the flesh of corpses?  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
Flesh...enstein, was it?  
That is what's happening with the Grail this time.  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
A lot of things got tampered with, and it turned into something weird...  
  
   
**Shimazu Sétanta:**   
It's a pain. Anyway, it seems like they're coming.  
Do you have a plan?  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
Well first, Lancer... Shimazu Sétanta, was it?  
I want you to lure the enemy in.  
  
   
**Shimazu Sétanta:**   
You want me to be bait? Leave it to me.  
But...Why am I the only one with a childhood name...  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
At least that's your real name!  
What's up with my Mouri or whatever?  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
A general from the Warring States period? What's that?  
I don't know anything about the history of the Far East!  
  
   
**Chousokabe Emichika:**   
Hm, a grand strategist and the Witch of Betrayal.  
The Grail certainly made strange pairings.  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
You there, don't look like you understand everything.  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
I want you to hit enemies lured in from the sides.  
An ambush, basically.  
  
   
**Chousokabe Emichika:**   
So it's like a guerilla attack. How clever. You're getting accustomed to this strategist thing, aren't you, Caster?  
  
   
**Shimazu Sétanta:**   
&mdash;So what are you going to do, Caster?  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
Me? I'm just a weak witch and waifu, right?  
I won't be joining in trivial matters like that.  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
Though I could charge my NP super fast and go nuts with my Rule Breaker...  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
I mean, apparently my younger version is getting summoned and taking the spotlight.  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
This time I'd like to keep my sweet, ladylike image.  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
Though I'm still pretty young, you know?  
  
   
**Shimazu Sétanta:**   
Okay, this is getting too long!  
Let's go!  
  
   
**Mini-Nobu:**   
Nobu, nobu!  
  
   
**Chousokabe Emichika:**   
Ah, be careful, Lancer.  
By the way, is that creature a dude?  
  
   
**Shimazu Sétanta:**   
Anyway, give me your hearts!  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
What! My heart?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It hasn't been taken yet! Anyway, we need to intercept them! Huh? Where's Sakura Saber?  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
Sorry, I'm feeling sick today...  
Cough!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is bad! Without Saber, fighting a Lancer class is going to be difficult!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sakura Saber's really difficult to deal with...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're talking kinda funny!  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You're right. What should I do? I know!  
Let's ask Magi☆Mari! (Escape from reality)  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Even the Doctor's been contaminated...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Chaldea should have been quarantined...  
Da Vinci, please make a vaccine!  
  
   
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
You unreliable man-slayer... Huh?  
What? What's going on? He's running away.  
  
   
**Shimazu Sétanta:**   
They have more people than our scout reported!  
I need to pull back for now.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't really get it, but this is our chance!  
Let's go after him, Senpai!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All right! After him!  
   
**Mash:**   
Mash Kyrielight, charging in!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, I'll carry Sakura Saber on my back.  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
...Thanks for always helping me, Mash.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is the first time!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I've got a bad feeling about this...  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Oh, shut it.  
Follow me!  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Hurry up and recover, man-slayer, or you're going to get labeled a useless Servant!  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
Strong Servant, weak Servant.  
That's up to them...  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
A truly strong Master will...  
(Cough!)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway, please get some rest!  
  
   
  
   
**Shimazu Sétanta:**   
Oh, so they actually managed to catch up...  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Hahahaha! We've got you now, Shimazu... or whatever your name is! Now prepare yourself!  
  
   
**Shimazu Sétanta:**   
Yea, I think&mdash; You're the ones who need to prepare yourselves.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What? We're being hit!  
From where?  
  
   
**Chousokabe Emichika:**   
Looks like Lancer led you right into our trap.  
Time to show you the power of an Archer.  
  
   
**Chousokabe Emichika:**   
Trace on!  
Broken Phantasm: Shoot!  
  
   
**Chousokabe Emichika:**   
When am I going to use this bow?  
That'd be right now! Fiiiiiish!  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
What is this rain of arrows? Is it an ambush?  
Oh, so when you ambush someone you want to...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is no time for explanations!  
We're not in some kind of seminar!  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
Ha, ha, ha. You dummies fell right into my plan.  
Good work, Lancer! I'll buy you some bread later.  
  
   
**Shimazu Sétanta:**   
Are you treating me like a kid?  
Get something with yakisoba in it. Nothing spicy!  
  
   
**Shimazu Sétanta:**   
...You guys should be more cautious.  
Me running away should've alerted you.  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
How could I be so careless... There's been no greater shame since Kanegasaki, Nagamasa...  
  
   
**Chousokabe Emichika:**   
Looks like you've given up.  
What are you planning on doing with them, Caster?  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
Let's see...  
What should we do with them?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry, Senpai...  
If only Sakura Saber could fight with us...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't give up!  
   
**Mash:**   
Do you have a plan that could get us out of this?  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Well if Monkey or Micchi were here, we could leave this to them and run away...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How do you feel?  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
... (Dead silent)  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
No response.  
She's on her last legs.  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Looks like we got a faulty Saber.  
Thanks for your service.  
  
   
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
Hahahahaha! Before Mouri Medinari, you're like a moth drawn to a flame!  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
...Am I playing the bad guy role a bit too heavy?  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
...Mouri?  
  
   
**Shimazu Sétanta:**   
You were always the bad guy.  
  
   
**Shimazu Sétanta:**   
In any case, I guess my role here as Shimazu or whatever is over.  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
...Shimazu?  
  
   
**Chousokabe Emichika:**   
I have no clue why I ended up as Chousokabe, but I guess that's the way it goes.  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
...Chousokabe...  
Tosa?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...What?  
Sakura Saber is...  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
Uuuoohhhh!  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
...With sadness and misplaced anger giving me power,  
I shall now don the haori of my oath!  
  
   
**Sakura Saber:**   
Satsuma and Choshu shall die!  
No mercy!  
  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
Huh? Satsuma and Choshu? What's that?  
This girl is completely different now! I'm scared!  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
I shall explain!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Eek! That caught me off guard!  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
This feeble man-slayer, known as Sakura Saber...  
Her True Name echoed through the streets of Kyoto at the end of the shogunate.  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
The one who swore to kill all Satsuma and Choshu...  
The captain of the Shinsengumi's First Unit, Okita Souji!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All of a sudden you reveal her True Name?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So you mean Okita Souji is a girl?  
Though, I guess I'm used to that by now!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not really knowledgeable about that era, but is she a famous Heroic Spirit, Senpai?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Pretty famous in Japan.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wow, a girl, no way. (lifeless)  
   
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
By the way, my True Name is Oda No&ndash;  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
It's finally time to pay Satsuma and Choshu back for Toba-Fushimi, Mr. Kondou!  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Yes! Also, I can't really forgive Tosa, either!  
  
   
**Chousokabe Emichika:**   
There's the Satcho Alliance too, so that can't be helped.  
But, I am the one that's troubled for being called Chousokabe.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Shinsengumi's First Unit Captain, Okita Souji!  
Here I come!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mouri Medinari:**   
Ah... The old me is so pitiful it hurts...  
  
   
**Shimazu Sétanta:**   
Oh my mentor, I'm sorry...  
By the way, that bodysuit...  
  
   
**Chousokabe Emichika:**   
Indeed, this is a bit stranger than expected...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Haaah, haaah... I-I did it, Mr. Hijikata... (Passes out)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
When Sakura Saber... I mean, when Okita donned her haori, she was ferocious, huh, Senpai?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
As expected of the genius swordsman.  
   
**Mash:**   
If she was in the First Squad, does that mean there were other powerful swordsmen in the Shinsengumi?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She collapsed again...  
   
**Mash:**   
Hang in there, Okita!  
Have this Golden Fruit!  
  
   
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
By the way, you're not interested in my True Name?  
I'm super famous in the Far East.  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
It's hard, you know, being such a popular Heroic Spirit!  
Everybody wants a piece of me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, it's time for lunch, Senpai.  
I packed us some.  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Guess nobody cares, huh?  
  
   
## Act 4: Overwhelming Victory!! GUDAGUDA Tenka Fubu  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
I'm getting tired of this, actually...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But that's so irresponsible!  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
This is all your fault to begin with, so you'd better see it till the end!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Okita, what was your relationship like with Demon Archer in your home world?  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
I don't know what to say... She's annoying.  
Especially when she warps around.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Look who's talking!  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
If you hadn't tried to convert the Grail into a bomb,  
this never would've happened!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You turned the Grail&mdash;into a bomb!?  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Yes, I planned to use it as a superweapon to turn things around.  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
But I screwed up and fell headfirst into the reactor core as it was reconstructing...  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Because of that, my powers were taken and weird creatures were born. It's unbelievable.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't understand, but now I know that you were up to some crazy things...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Oh, we made it here while she was blabbing.  
This is the heart of this Singularity, Osaka... I think?  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
This is clearly some European town...  
  
   
**???:**  
Fwahahaha!  
Welcome, mongrels!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-This voice!  
  
   
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**   
It is I, Toyotomi Gilyoshi! King of Heroes and ruler of Zipangu, the Land of Gold!  
  
   
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**   
All the treasures of this world, be they gold, or really nice tea sets, are all mine, hah!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Man, this situation is really getting out of hand. “Hah?”  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Hmm... He kind of reminds me of Monkey.  
  
   
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**   
Don't be mistaken, mongrels. This amount of mud won't even shake my being! I'm here on a different matter!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A different matter?  
  
   
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**   
I won't allow you to forget! I'm speaking of the time I bestowed treasures upon you! I offered you the finest gifts...  
  
   
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**   
...yet you mongrels greedily said how Rome's was better, or how you wanted the Dark ones!  
  
   
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**   
I wanted those too!  
I... I suffered too... I suffered greatly.  
  
   
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**   
Why... Why didn't anyone... come to my 10 Summons...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He said it wasn't going to shake his being, but things have become disappointing for the King of Heroes.  
  
   
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**   
I won't give up. Some things are beautiful because you don't own them. Heh, that's the healthy way to look at it.  
  
   
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**   
Now I build my power to prepare for the next event.  
  
   
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**   
I'm gathering gold and plain tea sets from this country,  
so that next time I can show people who the true king is!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Man, this is... Yeah.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Give me a 5-star next time!  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Calm down Senpai!  
I don't know what the King of Heroes is talking about...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...But since he seems like the last boss, let's defeat him and go home to sleep!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
To be honest, I'm getting tired.  
In more ways than one!  
  
   
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**   
Hmph. I am the sun itself, yet you point your blade at me, mongrel? Very well, Hanbei, Kanbei. Give me a plan!  
  
   
**Takenaka Andersen:**   
I ain't got one, moron.  
What's with this low-quality world setting!  
  
   
**Takenaka Andersen:**   
It doesn't make any sense!  
I told them not to make a 2D show into a 3D movie!  
  
   
**Kuroda Mephisto:**   
Such a shame! Such an awful, terrible shame!  
But, this is a rare chance, right?  
  
   
**Kuroda Mephisto:**   
In Asia we say, “Dance or explode, fellow idiots!”  
So let's take this chance to go boom!  
  
   
**Kuroda Mephisto:**   
Huh? Have I not been showing up as often lately?  
Aww, you're kidding me!  
  
   
**Kuroda Mephisto:**   
Don't you think Christmas Mephisto might just have a shot of happening?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, I do not!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**   
I can't believe I lost...  
My body falls and disappears with the dew...  
  
   
**Toyotomi Gilyoshi:**   
Uruk is just a dream within a dream...  
Act now to...become an Uruk citizen... (dies)  
  
   
**Takenaka Andersen:**   
Okay, we're done.  
Now my role is finished here.  
  
   
**Takenaka Andersen:**   
I liked the sound of “Takenaka Andersen” so I played along, but I'm sick of that laughing idiot's voice.  
  
   
**Takenaka Andersen:**   
This whole Japan setting is bad news, anyway.  
I might run into some crazy nun at any moment.  
  
   
**Takenaka Andersen:**   
Make sure you guys don't do this too much, okay?  
These marathons are best if you don't do them for too long.  
  
   
**Kuroda Mephisto:**   
A shame! A disappointment!  
Still, the famed fairy tale author sure is nice, huh?  
  
   
**Kuroda Mephisto:**   
I'm not exactly sure who was talking there, but I'll offer you this tea pot as a present.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you very kindly...  
  
   
**Kuroda Mephisto:**   
The simple and subdued culture of the Far East fascinates me! Exploding tea pots! How eccentric!  
  
   
**Kuroda Mephisto:**   
Let's all count down together!  
Three, two, one!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What? This explodes?  
Wh-What do we do Senpai?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Get down!  
   
**Mash:**   
Right! Senpai, hurry and get behind my shield!  
Hold me close! As close as you can!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Throw it away!  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right! I will throw this as far as I, Mash Kyrielight, possibly can!  
  
   
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Don't worry, only Matsunaga's teapot explodes. Yoink!  
...Yep, seems it's the core of that transformed Grail.  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Now my power will return, and we'll be all set...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?  
Archer?  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Archer...  
You can't be!  
  
   
**Demon Archer?:**  
Indeed...  
Everything is according to keikaku...  
  
   
## Final Act: Up in Flames!! GUDAGUDA Honnoji  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Fwahahahaha!  
I commend you for your efforts!  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Everything is according to keikaku!  
This whole thing was my idea!  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
Twelve Servant sacrifices to the Grail!  
I've regained my power!  
  
   
**Demon Archer:**   
I'll use the power of the Grail to make this space mine,  
and then make my way to your world!

**Fujimaru 1:**   
You tricked us!?  
   
**Mash:**   
No way! I mean, I kind of saw it coming?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Now I shall reveal my True Name!  
I am Oda Nobunaga, Demon King of the Sixth Heaven!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, we knew that.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nobbu, why...  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Indeed, I am the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Oda Nobu&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, we knew that.  
  
   
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Huh? How did you know?  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
You introduced yourself during lunch, even though nobody asked you.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Huh? What was I doing?  
  
   
**???:**  
Hah! You've shown yourself, then!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This voice!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga :**   
That's right, it's me!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Two... Nobunagas?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's going on?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This mess has reached its peak.  
   
  
   
**E：Oda Nobunaga:**   
Actually, I went to the bathroom after lunch,  
and someone attacked me from behind!  
  
   
**E：Oda Nobunaga:**   
The next thing I knew I was tied up behind the bathroom, but I managed to escape.  
  
   
**E：Oda Nobunaga:**   
In other words, the person that's been with you since lunch is a fake!  
  
   
**C：Oda Nobunaga:**   
Damn you, you're just half of me yet you're so persistent! My plan was to defeat the real me so I can become the real me!  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
I see.  
Thanks for the explanation.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
I think I understand, but I'm still not sure who's talking.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Why don't we just call them Good Nobbu and Bad Nobbu, so we can tell who's who?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, that might be a good idea...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can I just tap SKIP?  
   
  
   
**Bad Nobbu:**   
What? It's not fair to call me the bad one!  
I'm the same as her!  
  
   
**Good Nobbu:**   
I win! I'm the good Nobbu!  
I have finally unified this nation by force!  
  
   
**Good Nobbu:**   
The battle's as good as won!  
Surrender, Bad Nobbu!  
  
   
**Bad Nobbu:**   
Don't be a goody-goody!  
I come from you, so you're Bad Nobbu too!  
  
   
**Good Nobbu:**   
No way! You left me, so now I'm 100% Good Nobbu!  
  
   
**Bad Nobbu:**   
Curse you! You can't talk your way out of this, Good Nobbu! You're definitely worse than me!  
  
   
**Good Nobbu:**   
BZZT! Wrong! I can't believe how dumb and bad I am.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Could both of you shut up, please?  
  
   
**Bad Nobbu:**   
Fine, I'll show you what makes Bad Nobbu so good at being bad!  
  
   
**Bad Nobbu:**   
No matter how well Good Nobbu talks, I've got most of the power!  
  
   
**Bad Nobbu:**   
Now&mdash;I shall burn the world and its gods to ash!  
For I am Oda Nobunaga, Demon King of the Sixth Heaven!  
  
   
**Bad Nobbu:**   
FWAHAHAHAHA!  
Kneel before the power that slays even gods!  
  
   
**Good Nobbu:**   
Damn you, Bad Nobbu! Everyone!  
Band together and help me defeat my evil side!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yay! Last battle time!  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Yes! I'm starting to run low on magical energy and could disappear at any moment, so I'm glad.  
  
   
**Good Nobbu:**   
Your body's way too weak!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is there a way to defeat both of them?  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
What? I never thought of that.  
That's perfect! Brilliant!  
  
   
**Good & Bad Nobbu:**   
Huh?  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-Anyway, let's just beat the bad Nobunaga!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Bad Nobbu:**   
D-Damn you, Good Nobbu...  
But I have not lost to you!  
  
   
**Bad Nobbu:**   
I lost to the good Nobbu that's inside my heart!  
I will appear again... Yes...  
  
   
**Bad Nobbu:**   
When you forget to be grateful to the land for its blessings!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She said something ominous and disappeared.  
I suppose that means mission complete?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah. Let's go home.  
   
**Mash:**   
We picked up many tea sets along the way.  
I'm sure that will make Da Vinci happy.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That felt like forever.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, it was long in a lot of ways...  
Oh, we need to take back all these tea sets.  
  
   
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, looks like this space is starting to fall apart.  
Be careful on your way back.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga (Real):**  
Hmmm, my power has fully returned, it seems.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga (Real):**  
...Fwahahaha!  
Now I'm really, really done with you...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
I'm sure we've had enough of that.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Oh, everyone, thank you for your help.  
Next time, please come visit us in our world.  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
We're in the middle of a big war, though.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Indeed, our worlds were not meant to intertwine,  
but I've taken a liking to you!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
If you ever summon me, the power of the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven shall be at your disposal!  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Yes, but that probability is most likely very low...  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
...But if it ever happens, Fujimaru,  
I shall lend you my blade!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, thanks!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Summon... Probability... Ugh, my head...  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Goodbye Okita, Nobunaga!  
The takuan we had for lunch was delicious!  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
Hehe, I hope we meet again someday!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Yes, it wasn't for long, but you commanded well.  
Goodbye, Fujimaru! Farewell!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;That was pretty rough, huh, Senpai?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It felt like it was a dream.  
   
**Mash:**   
What do you think they're doing now?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm curious what happened to the Imperial Holy Grail, too.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah, it was such a mess.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I'm glad I didn't turn into a weird creature and go...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mash-Mash!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Like they did.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
What's this?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
Hey! How've you guys been?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Nobunaga?  
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
It's been a while, everyone.  
This time, my evil heart has gone out of control...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Leave!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Give me a break...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's a mess until the very end...  
   
  
   
**Okita Souji:**   
I'm really sorry for everything.  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga:**   
It can't be helped!
