# Moon Festival ~Does Moon Goddess Dream of Dumplings~  
  
## EP 0: Moonlight Hunter  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm-hmm♪  
La-la-laaa♪  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Whoa, Fujimaru.  
Why are you looking at me like that?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mmm, it's like you're saying “I, myself, don't know, but this must be a form of happiness.”  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Your expression is like a mixture of spiritual insight,  
affection, and a little pity. Has something happened?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, but, Doctor finally...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What, were you watching me?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And what do you mean by “finally?”  
I didn't do anything!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why are you walking around with an empty plate?  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, that's the problem. I keep waiting and waiting, but Mash hasn't come back yet.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I asked her to grab something from storage for me,  
but I wonder if something happened...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey, Romani, where are the dumplings?  
I'm about to show footage of the moon.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Let's hurry up and hit the booze.  
After all, we've been holding out for this day.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Hmph, yeah right. That's what you say,  
but you've already started drinking like a fish, you lout...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait a little while longer, Da Vinci.  
Not all the staff members are here yet.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Alcohol?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Dumplings?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? Fujimaru, didn't you hear? The outdoor calendar shows it's almost the end of summer.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Meaning it's almost time for the Moon Festival.  
It's said the harvest moon shall liven up conversations between friends.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The date isn't exactly right, but as long as there's a beautiful full moon in the night sky, it's perfect for the Moon Festival.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There's not a lot to do for fun in Chaldea, so I prepared this thinking we could use a break, but...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Mash hasn't come back yet.  
She was getting the dumplings from food storage.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
She said, “I'm powerful now that I've become a Demi-Servant, so leave it to me.” Then she took off on her own...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I have a bad feeling about this.  
Fujimaru, go see what's up&mdash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The alarm? What's going on?!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is serious, Doctor!  
Someone has raided our food storage!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As well as the offerings we prepared for the festival and everything else... Chaldea's food reserves are nearly down to zero!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What?!  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah. Good morning.  
I'm happy to see you're as healthy as ever.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Is this the place for that kind of conversation?  
I'm impressed by how much you trust each other.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That aside, those glasses really look good on you, Mash.  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah... Thank you.  
My eyes are good so I don't really need them, but...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Okay, look around you.  
This is supposed to be a tense scene.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, this is not the time to discuss that.  
Somebody raided our food storage. Who could it be?!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The thing is... None of the surveillance cameras picked up anything... They're not broken, but...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...but it's like all of the recorded footage has been painted over with a heart mark, so we can't see anything.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The analysis team in the monitor room said...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
“When we watched the footage, we got dizzy and fell unconscious, one right after the other...”  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm...  
I see. This is a real pickle.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A pickle?!  
Leonardo, have you gone bonkers, too?!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Ah, pardon me. I was just having a bit of fun.  
But anyway, Romani, take a look at this Singularity.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Three minutes ago, someone Rayshifted to France.  
That must've been the cause of the alarm.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Rayshift... With no authorization, and solo?  
You're saying the culprit escaped by Rayshifting?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can't imagine a Servant capable of something like that...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good point.  
Right now, Chaldea doesn't exist in normal dimension.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The only ones who can go outside are Master Fujimaru and  contracted Servants.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
On the other hand, a Contracted Servant can do evil deeds.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But only special and extremely powerful Heroic Spirits could bend the rules of time and space.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, did you make a contract with such a powerful Servant?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There are no records of it, as far as I know...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yes, but the order of cause and effect would be opposite, you see?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
We're talking about a Heroic Spirit that could bend time and space, and stretch the string of possibility for “eventually forming a contract”  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
into the “eventual outcome of a contract.”  
It would be an incredibly powerful Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...If it finds the coordinates of Chaldea using nonsensical means like that, that's incredible...  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But... I see,  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
if the culprit here is a Heroic Spirit who's willing to form a contract with Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Then the damage we suffer wouldn't be critical.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Because whatever the future, Fujimaru wouldn't form a contract with an outright villain.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, Doctor.  
The problem is that we don't have any food left.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At this rate, Senpai's health management and tea time after a Grail expedition can't be guaranteed.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As the Master's Servant, I propose we take measures quickly.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Y-yeah, I guess this is not the time to be thinking, “If we're out of sweet dumplings, we can just have sweet bean paste instead.”  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru.  
For the sake of Chaldea's future,  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
and our fun Moon Festival, would you go check out the situation for us?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes I'll go, Doctor.  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I knew I could count on you.  
That's why you're the Master of Chaldea.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You really like sweet bean paste, huh?  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, of course. Sugar is indispensable to someone who works with his brain.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Actually, I was more of a pancake guy, but I got addicted to it when I went to Japan. Hahaha.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
All right, Doctor, please prepare for the Rayshift.  
I'll get every last sweet dumpling back!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
(The culprit must be a Divine Spirit-class Servant that can Rayshift by itself...)  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
(Well, some things are better left unsaid!)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Rayshift is complete.  
This is&mdash;the France we're familiar with, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The one who raided Chaldea's storage is here&mdash;?  
Huh? I hear something being fired nearby...  
  
   
**Woman:**   
Oh my. What do we have here?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Master.  
There's a woman in strange clothes...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She's holding a bow in an improper posture,  
firing not so effective arrows, and&mdash;  
  
   
**Werebeast:**   
Ghraaaaaa!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She's fighting a pack of werewolves!  
What's going on here?!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't know, but let's help her!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
For now, let's fight!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Woman:**   
Oh my! Are you here to give me a hand, stranger?  
Hehe, aren't you a decisive one?  
  
   
**Woman:**   
I will take up on your kind offer. Let's fight together.  
  
   
**Woman:**   
We can leave the fun conversation for after the battle.  
Right now, let's take out these bandits!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Combat complete.  
But, I still sense enemies nearby.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, let me know the status of the surrounding&mdash;  
Doctor?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Bad connection?  
   
**Mash:**   
Seems like it... We can perform a Rayshift to return to Chaldea from here, but...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Think Roman's slacking?  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?  
The doctor's being lazy, you think?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can assure you that is not the case.  
Dr. Roman isn't the type to slack off at his job.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
The more pressing concern is this woman.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um... Excuse me. You're not a normal human, are you?  
Are you...a Servant?  
  
   
**Woman:**   
Hmm? Am I a Servant?  
Oh, you mean a Heroic Spirit! I know all about them!  
  
   
**Woman:**   
Indeed! I am a Servant!  
The splendid hunter forever seen in the night sky&mdash;  
  
   
**Woman:**   
My name is Orion! That's me!  
Round of applause, please!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You heard her, Senpai.  
What do you think?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Clap, clap, clap.  
   
**Orion:**   
Hehe. Thanks for the applause.  
I don't know who you are, but I think we can be friends♡  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wasn't Orion a guy?  
   
**Orion:**   
Truth is stranger than fiction, you know.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
They say that Orion was a fast-talking, no-good skirt-chaser who'd go after any woman he saw,  
but&mdash;  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**???:**  
PGRYU!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Pgryu?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Hehehe. Sorry, I think that's my tummy rumbling.  
I haven't had anything to eat in so long.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Anyway, they say all kinds of mean things about Orion in the legend, but he's actually a pure-hearted, wonderful hunter!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
And I've materialized to prove just that...  
Well? Do you believe me?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She's appeared in order to repair her reputation...  
In other words, to correct an incorrect history!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I know how you feel, Miss Orion.  
Your skills with a bow&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm really confused as to how you could hit a target effectively with that stance,  
  
   
**Mash:**   
but that was really impressive!  
You're as good as the Greek myths say!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The legendary hero who never misses, who seduced the Goddess Artemis!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Oh my. Oh dear. Never misses, you say?  
Hehehehe.  
  
   
**???:**  
Pgryyyrururur!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Your stomach again?  
   
**Mash:**   
Aww, that's bad manners, Senpai.  
You shouldn't ask a girl about her tummy.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Huh? Seduced a goddess?  
   
**Orion:**   
Oh, that's true. More specifically, he made a goddess fall in love with him♡  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
By the way, Miss Orion.  
Have you seen anyone suspicious around here?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We're looking for someone who stole a large amount of provisions from our base...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Suspicious people... Maybe that trio I just saw?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
They were running that way carrying something strange.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
But, they were a little out of it.  
All the food was falling out all over the place.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
See those wolves gathering?  
They're here to get the food that fell out.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai! That's good information!  
Let's hurry and follow them!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, but we need to get those dumplings back...  
Especially those super rare dumplings. I have to defend them at any cost...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh... Super rare... What?  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh&mdash;that's right.  
You don't know about it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mixed with the other dumplings are some special ones,  
made by a famous Japanese shop named Nanayabashiya.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Their taste rivals a 10,000 yen sukiyaki,  
and their value rivals a dozen Saint Quartz...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They're special.  
I'm not sure what I'm saying anymore.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash, calm down.  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh... Right. Sorry. I panicked.  
It's definitely not that I'm hungry.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway, they're very special dumplings. They're humanity's greatest treasure, and must be defended at all costs.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Orion:**   
I see! I understand.  
Can I help, then?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I owe you for saving me, and I need to showcase my archery skills, too. You're a Master, aren't you?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
If you saw Orion being useful here,  
I'm sure you would want to contract with her, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That would be great.  
Thanks for your help, Miss Orion.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, let's get those dumplings.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let the hunt begin!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Right! We'll pick up the rare dumplings as we chase after the thieves!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is a special mission, unlike any we've done before,  
but let's do our best!  
  
   
## EP 1: Antoinette and Company  
   
**Mash:**   
I see light ahead... It's a campfire!  
We caught up to them, Master!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But that's&mdash;that's&mdash;  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Here you go, d'Eon.  
Open wide. Say aaah♡  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
Th-th-thank you, Marie...  
Okay... Aaah.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Delicious, aren't they? They're so plump and chewy, and that sweet, sugary taste...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
And they're so cute, like snowballs.  
I'd love to learn how to make them.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Here, you have some, too.  
Aren't sweet dumplings lovely, Sanson?  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
Y-Yes... I accept this gratefully, my Queen.  
But is this really okay?  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
It said “Take what you like,” but for us to take all three tons of it...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
My dear Sanson, you need to take what you can, when it's offered to you.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Your modesty is commendable, but it's not good to be too modest.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
What happened to the bold Sanson who readied the guillotine?  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
No... My queen, I didn't actually like the guillotine.  
Quite the opposite...  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
You complain too much, executioner.  
Her Majesty said we're taking them.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
So we shall help her do it. That's all there is to it.  
Fortunately, we have access to Marie's glass carriage.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
Carrying a ton or two of snacks is easy.  
We should've taken more.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Heheh. d'Eon understands a maiden's heart.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
They're so delicious! It's natural for a person to want as much as they can carry.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Okay, say aah♡  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
Aaah!  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
Wait, you're eating more?!  
That's too much!  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
As a man of medicine, I must advise against consuming any more calories. You'll get fat...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Really, you don't have to worry, Sanson.  
Everything I eat goes right to my breasts.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
The more I eat, the bustier I get.  
So there's no way I'll get fat.  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
Wh-what...did you...say?!  
I-is that true, Marie?!  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
That's medically impossible!  
But if it is true, I...I!  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
...How crude. Sit down and stop panicking.  
But it's true, executioner.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
Her Majesty has grown to have one of the finest bodies in France. It's truly amazing.  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
&mdash;Tell me more! Give me more details!  
This is important for medical science!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
It's not medical at all!  
It's something all girls have in common!  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
(...I don't know...I think it's only you, your Majesty,  
who doesn't have any fat go to her belly...)  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
&mdash;!  
Chevalier!  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
I know! Get back, your Majesty!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You're all under arrest!  
Surrender peacefully, you dumpling thieves!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh, it's you!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
...You're ...You're...  
Who are you again? Sanson, do you know them?  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
Of course not.  
If you think you do, you're probably imagining it.  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
They're probably bandits, lured here by the light of our campfire.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
Indeed.  
For once we agree, executioner.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
Take up your swords, brigands!  
You'll pay for ruining her Majesty's snack time!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Hm...  
I really do think we've met somewhere, though...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I can't remember it... This is so strange...  
I have this feeling that we'd get along great...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
But, now that it's come to this, we shall fight!  
Forgive me for the rough welcome, familiar ones!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I'm sure you have your reasons, but we're enemies now.  
I'm not letting you have these dumplings!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's Marie for you.  
What a selfish declaration of war!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's go, Senpai!  
First, let's jog their memories in battle!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Sanson:**   
Gah!  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
Tch... They bested me!  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Auuuggghhh!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The battle is over.  
Now we can talk&mdash;  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Wait, Mash. There's one more back there. This presence... It's the same type of loser, just like my darling!  
  
   
**???:**  
Hahaha...hahahaha...  
So you saw me. Impressive...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai!  
A really shady-looking pervert came out of the shadows!  
  
   
**???:**  
I'm no pervert.  
I am Amadeus Mask. The wandering fairy.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh my! Amadeus Mask!  
You were following us in secret again?  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
You again, pervert?  
Go back to Vienna!  
  
   
**Sanson:**   
Heh... I can really count on you, huh?  
You showed up in our hour of dire peril...  
  
   
**Amadeus Mask:**   
Hehehe... The one I think I'd get along with dislikes me,  
and the one I don't care for finds me reliable... What's going on here?  
  
   
**Amadeus Mask:**   
Well, it doesn't matter. Maria is in trouble. I can swallow my pride and work with you, even if I don't want to.  
  
   
**Amadeus Mask:**   
Unknown travelers, prepare yourselves.  
  
   
**Amadeus Mask:**   
It's obvious that Maria and her friends are in the wrong,  
but you know, I don't really care.  
  
   
**Amadeus Mask:**   
Let us begin the symphony!  
Whew, I'm getting excited!  
  
   
**Amadeus Mask:**   
Can you beat these three true perverts, now that they're orchestrated by me, the God of Music?!  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
&mdash;Wait a moment.  
Did you just include me in your statement?!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Amadeus:**   
So yeah. A one-star Servant like me has no chance of winning.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
You truly are the worst!  
All you did was slow us down!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Did you see that, Senpai? ...When Amadeus' mask slipped off, it hit Sanson on the back of the head...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...And instantly knocked him out... Is that level of coordination only possible because they've known each other for years?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Don't worry about that, Mash.  
If Sanson was awake this discussion would take longer.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Marie, do you remember us now?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Yes, as we were fighting, somewhat.  
There's a lot to talk about, but first, here.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
You can have these wonderful confections back.  
We had a small amount. I'm sorry.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
(A small amount... A small amount?  
N-no, if her Majesty says so, then it's fine...)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, as long we have them back, it's okay.  
We were going to give these equally to everyone...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? Um...is this all? You were saying there were three tons worth a moment ago...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
That was at the start.  
I did load up the carriage, but...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
We ran into a group of three people passing by,  
and gave them most of the dumplings as a sign of friendship.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What?!  
You gave them almost three tons worth?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Of course. When you think about it, no matter how good they are, you can't eat three tons, can you?  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
Yes, that's right. I would've preferred you to think about that sooner, though.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's a very good point, Marie...  
So where did the three strangers go?  
  
   
**Marie:**   
They said they were going to pray near the waters of Marseille. If you hurry, you might catch them.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, let's hurry, Mash!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah, let's get the grinding going, Mash!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Marie, I'd love to talk more, but we're in a hurry...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Yes, I know.  
Please be careful, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
May fortune smile upon your journey!  
Vive la France! And whassup!  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
My queen?! (Turns around in shock)  
  
   
## EP 2: Battle at the Coastline  
   
**Georgios:**   
Hmm...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
...It's quiet.  
Very quiet. Don't you think, St. Martha?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Indeed. The ocean waves are calm tonight.  
By the way, St. Georgios...  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
What is it?  
Oh, you want a photo?  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Unfortunately, my specialty is landscapes, not people.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
No one wants one of your photos.  
I'm talking about those.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Oh, these?  
My apologies. It's about time, yes. Will you go first?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh, my. I'm a little embarrassed.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
But I cannot turn down your offer, St. Georgios.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Excuse me... Aaah.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh! These smell so good, and its texture on the tongue!  
It's super-duper yummy&mdash;Ahem.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
It tastes splendid.  
The wisdom of the East is not to be dismissed.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
I'll have some for myself&mdash;Ahem.  
This is...Oho! It's hot! It's hot, but sweet!  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
It seems simple, but you don't tire of it.  
It has a smooth surface, but a complex taste.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Simple, yet deep.  
How to describe it?  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
You describe it as tasty, you two.  
If you'll excuse me, I'll have one myself.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Hmm... Mm...They're bite-sized, but not so small that it's not enough.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
These dumplings are clearly the work of a master.  
I am in awe.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Truly, you can find geniuses in any era.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
...  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
What's wrong, Martha?  
Is there something stuck on my face?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
No, I was just wondering what that black,  
honey-like sauce was.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I don't want one for myself.  
For one thing, I don't trust you.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
You've been tagging along with us for days.  
Why don't you tell us what you're after?  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
My goal is as I spoke of when we first met.  
I seek a duel with you. That is all.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
And I refused.  
I preach the folly of battle.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Besides, why must I fight you?  
I'm not the type.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Oh?  
Is that really true?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
It's true! You sound like you don't believe me!  
Are you making fun of me?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
What is your problem, anyway?  
Are you even a real samurai?  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Hahaha. You saw right through me.  
When I have to act like a samurai, I can.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
I am a wanderer, I act differently at different times.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
But I'm not the only one.  
You seem to be carrying such burden as well.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
A particularly big one.  
Tarasque, was it?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Huh!? You're after my Tarasque?  
Not me!?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I don't know how many wyverns you've taken down,  
but I doubt you can do anything with that skimpy sword?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Don't underestimate the scales of the Tarasque.  
They were thick enough to withstand one of my punches!  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Oh, your punches? How interesting.  
I thought your weapon was a staff?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
!!!  
Oh, how silly of you. Ahahah.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Perhaps you're hard of hearing?  
I'm a saint. I would never punch anyone.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Hahaha. Come to think of it, before “He” gave her the staff, St. Martha was completely empty-handed, I'm told.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
So before you settled in as a Saint, you were fighting dragons with your bare hands, huh?  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
I find that fascinating. As a fellow dragon slayer,  
I would've liked to have caught that with my camera.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I have not punched any dragons! I don't street-brawl anymore, and I've never fought with my bare hands in my life!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
And Georgios, didn't you say you only photographed landscapes?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Another set of three Servants.  
I guess you could call these the three dragon slayers...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We're lucky Siegfried isn't here.  
...Let's get ready to head in, Master!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Enough cooking and eating dumplings!  
Surrender peacefully to the ropes!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Huh? What's this about ropes?  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
She means to not struggle against her. In old Japan they'd tie up criminal's bodies with ropes before taking them away.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
R-Ropes... Couldn't they just tie our hands...  
That's crazy, tying up someone's whole body...  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Criminals?  
I've no idea what you're talking about.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, I'm sorry, Mr. George.  
Those dumplings were stolen from Chaldea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So I think you became guilty the moment you ate them.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But if you just give them back, we can forget all about it...  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
...I see.  
Even if we didn't know, how could we do such a thing?  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
We paid for this food, but if it was stolen in the first place...  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Miss, we've never met before, but you seem to be telling the truth.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
I'll return this bag of food to you.  
That is the least we can do.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh...Oh, right.  
That would be a big help, but...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're not...fighting?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can't believe you actually listened to us!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Martha:**   
Of course.  
We're famous saints, you know.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
We admit when we're wrong, and strive to correct it.  
Though I do wish I could've had some more.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
And only St. Georgios paid any money.  
Since I am not at any loss I don't really mind.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
That's right. Now, please take them.  
And return to this “Chaldea” place of yours.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
I'm simply a freeloader, so I have no objection.  
Battle solves nothing.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Everyone...  
Senpai, let's go back. The mission is complete!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Hmm? Wait a second.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
That was very touching, but I think that samurai's hiding a rare dumpling in his pocket.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Hmm? Samurai? Do you mean me?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
And the saint has some behind her back, right?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Wh-what are you talking about?  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
How disgraceful, you two...  
I do apologize.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
I'll stay here. Feel free to take these criminals back with you.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
And you, the man with long hair, your camera pack is stuffed with hidden dumplings.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
THOU ART A DRAGON!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mr. George...  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Huh!? What a sharp-eyed lady...  
It seems we have no choice but to fight...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Indeed. It's not fair to call me a thief,  
and I want more dumplings anyway.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Just this once, I'll abandon my holy vows.  
Even though they are weightier than Tarasque.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Tarasque's pretty light then, huh?  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Kojirou, you fight, as well.  
You've eaten plenty of free food up until now.  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Yes, I've got nothing to do with this, but fair enough.  
You shall taste the wrath of my secret blade.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They're coming, Mash!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's the problem with saints...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Right! They weren't listening to us at all!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Georgios:**   
What have I done...  
What got into me?  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
It must be the magical energy of the moon that compelled me to use Ascalon.  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
Please realize, milady...  
The true enemy...is close at hand... (ka-thud)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Georgios?!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mr. George!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Kojirou:**   
...I never before fought out of greed, and now greed has dulled my blade...  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
In the moment greed took over, my defeat was assured...  
Bean paste buns are scary...  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Oh, and I was strangely strong not because I'm on my home ground, but because of my class affinity? (ka-thud)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
LEGEND OF SAMURAI?!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Kojirou what's-his-name!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Both of them died well... We have the dumplings right here, so I'll get some incense for the funeral.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
They haven't disappeared. They're just pretending to pass out because they're embarrassed.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Men can be so proud over the silliest things.  
Who cares if you lose a fight?  
  
   
**Georgios:**   
A brutal strike! DWAH!  
  
   
**Kojirou:**   
Such merciless truth! KWAH!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...That one really did knock them out.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Is she really a saint?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
It's true that men and women may have different views on fighting.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Statistical data shows that women engage in competition on a daily basis, and don't obsess over a single defeat.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They'd prefer to use the extra calories obsessing over more constructive things, I hear.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is that true for you, too?  
   
**Mash:**   
I...I don't know. I haven't fought enough to really find value in the outcome of a fight.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, but this is just statistical data.  
It differs for each individual.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Orion:**   
Hey, guys, I hate to interrupt, but that scary woman is running straight for the sea.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Hahahaha! It's too late!  
Come forth, Tarasque! Scramble ride!  
  
   
**Martha:**   
I'm outta here, kiddies!  
Next time we meet, I'll get you for this!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh! The sea parted, and a dragon came out...  
No, a turtle? An extremely tired-looking iron dragon?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Whatever it is, it's spinning up into the sky!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It looks just like an unidentified flying object, doesn't it, Senpai?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, that's what everyone thought.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She just made the morning papers.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Martha:**   
Oh, but as a way of expressing our gratitude for the dumplings...  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Yes, we did buy them off of a strange group in a glass carriage&mdash;  
  
   
**Martha:**   
But later we ran into a fat man calling himself an emperor, and gave him the other half.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
He was very skilled at persuasion...A professional debtor.  
The type who never pays back what he owes.  
  
   
**Martha:**   
Be careful!  
You'll find him in the wasteland!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Hmm, after saying all that, she just flew off.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Looks like we've got more work to do.  
I don't mind, though. I'm having fun.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
What will you do, Mash, Fujimaru?  
If you're going to give up, now might be the time.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, we'll get as many dumplings back as we can.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's go, Master.  
That fat man is definitely our next foe!  
  
   
## EP 3: Moon Over the Ruined Castle  
   
**Caesar:**   
Not bad. Not bad at all. I prefer plump, delicious fruit, but this is not bad.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Excellent form. Easy to transport. Keeps for days.  
And more than anything, easy to eat!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Yes, yes, yes, yes!  
What is this? I can't stop putting them in my mouth!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Once you start, you just can't stop! I've got no choice but to eat all the dumplings in the world!  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
WWAAARRHH! NNEERROOO!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Heh, I see you're devouring them, too.  
You're not a true Roman emperor unless you love to eat.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Though I guess I'm not really an emperor.  
I just laid the foundations for an empire.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
WAAARGGHH! FATSO!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I am not fat! I am plump!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
There's a huge pile of dumplings behind them...  
We finally reached our main target, I guess.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
What will you do?  
Try to talk to them?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't think that'll work.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's heed Martha's warning.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-yes... The tyrant Caligula is a Berserker.  
We won't be able to talk to him.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Caesar is a Saber, so we can communicate with him,  
but he's also a little TOO good at talking.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If we try to talk to him, he might just “round” up the conversation in his favor.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Yeah...He's really...round.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
For now, let's approach them, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If we attack them from the front then we're in accordance with the laws of chivalry, we won't be cowards.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You seem like you're getting angry.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Chival...ry?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Stop acting like a food processor.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Those provisions belong to Chaldea, not Rome!  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
...? Not...Rome?  
Rome...isn't...a dumpling...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
But great Caesar is...round...  
What is...the meaning...of this?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Stop comparing me to things that are round!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
...Sigh. You interrupted my wonderful snack time...  
A mess. This is truly a mess.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
But I guess you've appeared at last.  
You're here for these Moon Festival dumplings, right?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I managed to embezzle these from that wicked Rider...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Senpai, did he just say “embezzle?”  
I'm not hearing that wrong, right?)  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
And I have a just reason for doing so.  
Well? Will you listen to me, milady?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
You will, of course! Everyone listens to me!  
My speeches are said to be worth their weight in gold!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
So allow me to tell you how I made these dumplings mine.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
U-um, that's not necessary...  
Let's just fight. Yeah. Fight.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not really interested in the reason.  
Please just give them back...  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Ahem. I haven't introduced myself.  
How could I forget?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I am none other than the famous flower of Rome,  
the Crimson Swordsman, Red Saber!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sorry. You're going to get sued for that.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Impossible!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Hmm, no good, huh?  
I thought I could pull it off.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
And Caligula, you too?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Anyway, allow me to continue. Traveling this bountiful land, I encountered a delicious scent.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
And then&mdash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You came, you saw, you bought! Right?  
   
**Mash:**   
I understand how you feel, but be quiet, Master.

**Fujimaru 2:**   
... (Deliberately say nothing)  
   
**Caesar:**   
...No response, huh?  
Sad...How very sad...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Caesar:**   
Anyway, I sensed a wicked plot was involved. Thinking I should probably take action, I confiscated them.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
But if they were stolen, I can understand your anger.  
A sense of righteousness can create stronger feelings than revenge.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I dislike fighting. It's a pain.  
So let's do this.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
First, I will trust you, and give you back these dumplings.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
You will go around and sell them at three times the price, then come back.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I'll take the money, and give you no less than double what they're worth!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Well? Your gain, not loss, and I get the satisfaction of having trusted you.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
How about I give them back to you under these terms?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ooh...So peaceful!  
   
**Orion:**   
Calm down, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I'm easily tricked, so I'm not one to talk,  
but you're being tricked right now!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Ooh...Such a rip-off!  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right, Master.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Martha was correct.  
Talking to Caesar is a waste of time.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Caesar:**   
Hmm. It didn't work, huh?  
I tried copying Cleopatra...  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
But, very well. Fighting it is.  
Caligula, prepare yourself.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
KWAAAOOOHH!  
They're clearly in the right, but WWWRROOAAH!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Heh. Come, then!  
I'll give you a taste of my Crocea Mors!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Caligula:**   
GGGNNOOOAAAH!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Hmph, there's limits to what I can do as a Saber?!  
If only there were a class where I could win more easily.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Combat complete. We won, Master.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We'll take the dumplings back, then.  
Now we can return to Chaldea&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? It's so...heavy?!  
I was able to carry it before, but...  
  
   
**???:**  
...Nom nom...nom nom...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Wait, Mash?!  
There's someone in the bag!  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
What?  
Wait...I'll look...inside...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Glory is given...to the victors...  
It is not good...to deny them...that...  
  
   
**???:**  
No need.  
These belong to me.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Gnuh?!  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Oops. Have I cut the bag, as well?  
Forgive me. I do not destroy life. (Nom nom)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Something crazy came out?!  
   
**Mash:**   
That's um...Who is that?  
It's clearly a top-class Servant, but...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well, he had to be a good guy at the end...  
   
**Caesar:**   
Indeed. I suppose it's Caligula's destiny to be killed through a cloth...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Orion:**   
No way...Altera?!  
What's she doing here?!  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Why are you surprised, woman?  
Wherever there is civilization, I appear.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Altera? The Great King of the Western World,  
a warrior of the Huns, the avatar of destruction?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
But how did she get here?  
And how exactly did she get inside that bag?!  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I walked here, basically.  
Rayshift is civilization, so I do not use it.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
You walked again?!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
...Mash, Fujimaru.  
She looks calm, but don't underestimate that woman.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
She's a natural predator, not just of us,  
but of you humans.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
She destroys any buildings she sees, as well as some she doesn't see. She doesn't target anything of nature, but she ends up destroying it too.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
She's a giant pain in the neck, who destroys everything around her just by walking.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
That is a misunderstanding.  
I do make distinctions.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
In the end, it comes to feelings.  
I've realized there are different types of civilization.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Nom, mmm.  
Basically, there are both good and bad civilizations.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Dumplings are good civilization.  
Moon Festival is bad civilization.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
So I am taking these dumplings, nom, and destroying you for having Moon Festivals, nom.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
If you get in my way, I will show no mercy.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I will use this War God's sword, I happened to find on the ground, to destroy you.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
What do you mean “happened to find?”  
Anything you use turns into that thing!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Hmm, this is bad. I'll help you!  
I can't let what happened to Rome be repeated!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master! The mysterious enemy Servant is coming!  
We'll fight her with everything we've got!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Altera:**   
...Well, that was not successful.  
The dumplings were good, though.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Oh&mdash;When will this dream&mdash;When will my Noble Phantasm attain its true power&mdash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Good...The enemy Servant has vanished.  
Now we can finally&mdash;  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Whew! Finally made it through!  
Hello? Hello?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Are you two okay!? I just detected an incredible vortex of magical energy!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, are communications back?  
...Did you activate the Rayshift?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, I detected the provisions near you,  
and activated the Rayshift.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You have nothing else left to do, right?  
Then hurry and come back to Chaldea.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Moon Festival party will be waiting for you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes...That's right.  
We did achieve our goals, but...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? Where's Orion?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right. I don't see her anymore.  
I wanted to thank her for her help...  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Hmph. I'm still here.  
Do you have any goodbyes for me?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You were useless against Altera.  
   
**Caesar:**   
I can't help it. It's my class affinity.  
I wouldn't be more useful than that woman Archer.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Want to join us for the Moon Festival at Chaldea?  
   
**Caesar:**   
No, thank you. The offer is enough.  
Unknown Master, I hope we meet again someday.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you for your help, though.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Just having you on our side was a big help.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Yes, it means one less enemy.  
You understand war well.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
And so I shall give you one final warning.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
When it comes to food, the first owner and the last owner are different.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
So who is the true owner of these dumplings?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Was it the one who prepared them? No.  
The one who cooked them? Even less so.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Then who do they belong to?  
They belong to the one who is last to eat them.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
You claimed ownership of the dumplings, but from  
“that person's” perspective, that's nothing but a joke.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Listen well. If you fail to realize this, the truth will remain forever hidden in darkness.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Caesar, what do you mean?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Hahahaha!  
Stay hungry, and you'll find the answer someday!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Farewell, farewell to you, girl with a bosom that's soft like a dumpling!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I take back my thank you!  
I think Rome is a bad civilization!  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I was a little worried for a while there, but I'm glad to see you both safe.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We're handing out all the dumplings you recovered now.  
The Moon Festival party will begin soon.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Just rest a little until then.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'd love to know what happened out there, but I'll wait.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You can tell all the staff about your adventures.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sure, but, um...Doctor.  
Did you find the cause of the communications problem?  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
O-Oh, no. I couldn't find it.  
All our equipment was working normally.  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But if there was a cause&mdash;  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It wouldn't be on Chaldea's side, but your own.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Some kind of problem should have shown up during the time you Rayshifted and when the comms came back online...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Fujimaru, any idea?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...A little.  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Pick...Up...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, if it wasn't a problem, you can forget it.  
Good work out there!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Enjoy the rest of your time at the Moon Festival party!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Something doesn't feel right.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I still feel like...  
I want some more rare dumplings.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We haven't caught the thief, and the greatest question still remains.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Who was that Orion?  
  
   
## EP 4: Does Moon Goddess Dream of Dumplings?  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
These...appear to be the hills of France...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But what are we doing here?  
We were gathering rare dumplings...  
  
   
**???:**  
Hehehe. I'll tell you, Mash.  
  
   
**???:**  
“Thank you for all the work you've done for me and Orion. Good job, you two!”  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Just kidding!  
Good evening, Master of Chaldea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Miss Orion!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Hey, how've you been, Mash♡ It's a bit late, but do you need an introduction and explanation?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, I think we kind of do.  
   
**Orion:**   
Hehe. Soft on the outside, and prickly where it counts.  
I like it.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
All right, time to explain!  
I was the one who attacked Chaldea's food supply!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Or at least, that was the plan.  
But it didn't work.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Um, I virtually proved the causality of being summoned by you, and managed to get into Chaldea,  
  
   
**Orion:**   
but then it was just one failure after another.  
Lots of nasty traps kept me out of the storage.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
All I could do was transport your entire storage into the Singularity.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
And once I'd done that, I jumped to retrieve them, but...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
By an unfortunate coincidence, a passing queen got to them before I could.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
You know the rest.  
I chased after the dumplings,  
  
   
**Orion:**   
gathered almost enough rare dumplings for the special Craft Essence, and waited for the time of my full revival!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No, I think we're good.  
   
**Orion:**   
R-Really?  
Hmm, you don't need an explanation, huh?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
But, that's fine. It makes this easier.  
All that's left to do is fight.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
So you were the real culprit?  
But why?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
For the dumplings, of course.  
The dumplings.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
The dumplings are a manifestation of faith, created for the moon... An offering to the moon.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Do you understand? They're a way to win the favor of the gods and bring them here.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Even if Chaldea didn't intend for it to happen, doing a ritual like that in a place with a summoning system...  
  
   
**Orion:**   
...was enough for me to awaken.  
More specifically, it slapped me awake.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
But when I woke up, I was starving.  
I didn't have nearly enough magical energy.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
So I wanted dumplings.  
The sacrifices that were created for me.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
They are thoughts, created for me.  
A rare source of magical energy that exists to feed me.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Then&mdash;for the last few days Senpai and I have been running around to try and revive you!?  
  
   
**Orion:**   
That's right♡  
But please don't treat me as evil or anything.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I'm on your side...well, I'm not.  
But, I'm not your enemy.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
If my darling is on your side, then I'm willing to be, too.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Anyway, thanks to all the rare dumplings that Fujimaru found, I can join your other Servants.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
All that's left is to wait for you to summon me&mdash;  
But first, don't you think we need to test your skills?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
[♂ Agreed. You'll pay for tricking me. /♀ Agreed. You're going to regret this.]  
   
**Orion:**   
Hmm... I guess you're right.  
I didn't trick you, but it is true that I was having fun...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can we talk instead of fight?  
   
**Orion:**   
Impossible. I don't like humans to start with.  
And I dislike the weak ones the most.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
So I want you to show me that you're strong enough to beat selfish, unreasonable, and inhuman old me.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
Otherwise, you can't handle a Servant like me.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Sigh...I figured it would end like this.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But I was kind of ready for it, so it's fine!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mash Kyrielight&mdash; Ready to go, Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Right! Let's beat this goddess, Mash!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Orion:**   
That's the spirit!  
Let me reintroduce myself then.  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I am the deity of moonlight, the elegant representation of purity, virginity, hunting, and eternity&mdash;  
  
   
**Orion:**   
One of the ancient gods of Mt. Olympus!  
I, the Moon Goddess Artemis, shall test you!  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I hope you do well. Try and beat me, just like my darling did that day♡  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Artemis:**   
Kyaaahh!  
You! Beat! Me!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We did it! A perfect victory, Master!  
We defeated the Moon Goddess Artemis!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
(Sob, sob) I told you to fight hard, but you didn't have to hit THAT hard... Oww!  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Now causality is established.  
I don't know when we'll meet again.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Maybe when we do, I won't remember Mash, or you, Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
But I have become a part of you. The Moon Goddess shall flow from Olympus to Chaldea.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No...  
Goddess Artemis is disappearing...  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Aww, silly.  
Next time, just call me Artemis, Mash.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
This is just a temporary goodbye. I'm sure that before long...we'll see each other again on those familiar seas.  
  
   
**Artemis:**   
Until then, goodbye! It wasn't very long, but I enjoyed our Moon Festival night adventure!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Artemis...disappeared.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll see her again.  
   
**Mash:**   
You're right. Even if none of us remember what happened tonight, I'm sure we'll be able to get along.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I hope we can see her again.  
   
**Mash:**   
We will. She loves humanity so much.  
I'm sure we'll see her soon.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I know she said she didn't like humans, but I'm sure that's just because she can't leave us alone.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...The dream is ending.  
Our night of adventure is coming to a close.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Good work this time.  
I'll see you when you wake up, Senpai.
