# GUDAGUDA Meiji Restoration  
  
## Prologue: GUDAGUDA Civilization and Enlightenment  
   
**A：Nobbu:**   
Ahh...it's springtime.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
We're going to have to put away the kotatsu soon.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You two are still here?  
   
**A：Nobbu:**   
Don't be such a lame. Besides...  
  
   
**A：Nobbu:**   
Last time, during the “Super GUDAGUDA Honnoji:  
Ginormous Spring Celebration Incident,”  
  
   
**A：Nobbu:**   
the super Demon King of the Sixth Heaven awakened just in the nick of time... Yep! It was my awesome heroism that made that event the success it was!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Uh...that was not a real event.  
On the other hand...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
At the end of “Super GUDAGUDA Shinsengumi:  
Okita's Grand Victory”...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...a tan me unleashed a mega-powerful beam attack that was absolutely amazing!  
  
   
**A：Nobbu:**   
Hah! Now you're just talking crazy. You don't have an Alter, and everyone knows you can't beam.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No! Don't put it away!  
   
**Okita:**   
Ah, I knew that Master would appreciate the transience and imperfection of the kotatsu! Now, come, you can sit next to me.  
  
   
**A：Nobbu:**   
Hey! Don't push! You're kicking me!  
Sheesh, stay on your own side!  
  
   
**A：Nobbu:**   
...And hey, where's my mandarin?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Um, it's April. Mandarins are out of season.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Hey, speaking of April, did you play the special April Fools' game?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Why would I!? If it isn't Nobunaga-focused,  
then I'm not interested!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai! There's an intruder in Chaldea!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, Nobunaga and Okita. You're...still here...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Wait a minute! Why are you two lounging in Senpai's room!? M-may I join you?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Still as foxy as ever, eh, Demi&ndash;I mean, Boobie Servant? So, what do you want? What's with all the ruckus?  
  
   
**Mini Nobu:**   
Nobbu!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Oh...is there still a dark version of me lurking around?  
We did just do the revival event the other day.  
  
   
**???:**  
Argh! Move, you weirdo creature! You're mega creepy!  
...Wait, creature?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who's there!?  
   
**???:**  
I'm glad you asked! Chacha is a mysterious masked warrior hailing from another dimension who has come to warn you of terrible impending doom!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A masked man!?  
   
**???:**  
I'm no man! Chacha is a mysterious masked woman hailing from another dimension who has come to warn you of terrible impending doom!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Chacha...is it?  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Huh? How did you know Chacha's name!?  
Do you have eeyespee?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Chacha...I've heard of her. I believe she was the concubine of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the man who unified Japan during the Sengoku* period. (*TL Note: Sengoku=Warring States)  
  
   
**Okita:**   
She was the daughter of Nobunaga's younger sister, Oichi. The eldest of the three Azai Sisters, she led a kinda...ill-fated life.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hey! Don't you turn into a history nerd on me!  
Wait a minute. Chacha...are you THAT Chacha!?  
  
   
**???:**  
Hm? I hear a familiar voice... A-Auntie!?  
I thought you got torched by Akechi in Honnoji!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Sorry to butt in when you're all getting excited, but this reading I'm picking up... It's one we've seen before...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Remember? The most awkward of all readings analyzed in Chaldea's history? The Guda Guda Particles.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Explaining would be boring AND painful, so how about you just imagine for yourselves what they do and go with that. See ya☆  
  
   
**Okita:**   
You really suck with our event infodumps.  
But I guess it's okay. Simplicity makes it easier!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can't we get a more detailed explanation...!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The newbies need to know!  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
You KNOW what we're talking about, Senpai!  
It's “that thing”!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's the completely terrifying Guda Guda Particle... Servants it contaminates turn into utter disappointments!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, let's get out of here quickly!  
If we don't hurry, even I risk turning into Mashy-Mashy!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Looks like you're all on the same page now!  
Come with Chacha if you want to live!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
...Um, by the way, are you the Master from that Chaldea place?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm Fujimaru, Master of Chaldea, yes.  
   
**Chacha:**   
Umhm! Good answer! And you've got a good expression on your face! If Chacha says so, it must be true!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Happy? YOU'RE HAPPY RIGHT?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Argh! Forget about it!  
Just hurry up and get us outta here!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I wanted to watch “Get Stella-ed If You Laugh: Chaldea” on TV tonight!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm liking the mask and helmet combo. It's cool.  
   
**Chacha:**   
Eh!? Cool? I heard that the world of today was dangerous, so I sneaked into His Highness's storage house and took them.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
D-do I look good in them? R-really? Tee hee...  
Chacha looks good in anything anyway!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Yes, yes. I have a feeling this is going to be another painful ordeal, but just leave everything to me again, Master!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
I shall support you from behind the scenes, Senpai!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Then let's go! Off to some crazy-weird realm Chacha doesn't understand at all!  
  
   
**Okita & Nobunaga:**   
What!? You don't understand it!?  
  
   
## Section 1: Blackbeard Arrives  
   
**Edward Perryeach:**   
Dufufufufu... Open up&ndash;  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Fire!!!  
  
   
**Edward Perryeach:**   
My role was brief but glorious!  
  
   
**Edward Perryeach:**   
My dream of opening up Nippon...and setting up a Pirate Market in Zipangu...!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Welp, all done! Let's go home and watch some TV.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
So Chacha, what time period are we in anyway?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
I don't really know, but it doesn't seem like the one Auntie and Chacha lived in; ours was much further back in the past.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
...Wait! That guy wasn't the problem!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
..It seems like it's 19th-century Japan. Around the end of the bakufu*, I think. (*TL Note: bakufu=shogunate)  
  
   
**Okita:**   
The end...of the shogunate...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hey, that's when Okita was alive...  
   
**Okita:**   
Yes, it seems like it was just yesterday, yet it feels so long ago... Something about this feels slightly different, though.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
But that's not what I'm talking about! Chacha didn't come to get your help because of that wacky-looking barbarian.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Pre-Meiji Restoration...  
   
**Chacha:**   
Meiji Restoration? What's that? Cultural reform?  
A cheat event in modern-day Japan?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
I see. Well, Chacha isn't interested!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Hmph! Who cares about that.  
Chacha came to you to solve an even greater crisis!  
  
   
  
   
**Nobu Tank:**   
Chacha. Detected. Nobunobu!  
Capture. Chacha. Nobunobu!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Eh? Me? A tank? Why am I a tank?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
And, you guys can talk!? Did you evolve on your own!?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
They found me!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
N-no! Chacha does not want to go back there!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
There's nothing in that castle anymore!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I'm sure this is all Bad Nobbu's fault, but let's just defeat it! Please stand back, Master!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Since it's come to this, Ch-Chacha will also help.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Ha! Touch Chacha, and you'll get burned! Literally!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Chacha:**   
Th-that was a close one! I express my thanks to you,  
Fujimaru! Chacha will pat you on the head! Hup! Huuup!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Argh! I can't reach!  
Lower your head, you insolent fool! Read the room!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Like this?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Understood!  
   
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Hm. You're cute. Chacha is a very tolerant individual, and I like kiddos who are obedient like you!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
But don't fall for me. Chacha is a cute, loving, and popular character type, so to you mass-produced normies, I'm an unattainable prize like from a carnival!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, but aren't you a child yourself?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
What!? Don't act all big just because you have big boobies! Chacha in her heyday was all va-va-voom and boin-boin!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
It's not my fault I got summoned as a loli Berserker!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Uwaa? Chacha's a Berserker!? Wh-how!?  
  
   
**Local Fisherman:**   
Whoa, you guys are amazing. First you get rid of that funny-looking foreigner, then you destroy that mechanical doll from the bakufu.  
  
   
**Local Fisherman:**   
Honestly, ever since the Oda Bakufu took over last week after defeating Lord Tokugawa, there's been nothing but fighting. I'm sick of it.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Eh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Huh?  
   
  
   
**Okita & Nobunaga:**   
Oda Bakufu&mdash;!?  
  
   
**???:**  
So you found Chacha...  
And who were those people with her?  
  
   
**Mini Nobu:**   
Nobunobu! Nobunobu!  
  
   
**???:**  
...Riiight... I haven't the slightest idea what that was supposed to mean.  
  
   
**???:**  
...Whatever. It doesn't matter who they were.  
No one can interfere with my plans!  
  
   
**???:**  
That's right, Chacha...  
Your pathetic scrambling is pointless!  
  
   
**???:**  
This world belongs to me, Oda Nobunaga&ndash;the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven!  
  
   
## Section 2: Nobbudamon Incident  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Here we are. Kyoto.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
So let me get this straight... Without waiting for the Meiji Restoration, the Tokugawa Bakufu just up and vanished like food around that blue Saber.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
And instead, the Oda Bakufu popped up like kettle corn on Chaldea's movie nights?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Ugh! I don't know who did it, but I will NOT allow a new bakufu if I'm not the one who made it!!!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hm? This shop's shiruko desserts are the best!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
I want some, I want some! Chacha loves sweet shiruko soup! Stewing adzuki beans into a sweet soup is such a devilish idea!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
It's scary-good!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Shiruko has always been sweet...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Wait a minute. Did shiruko even exist during your lifetime, Nobbu?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Yup. I picked up this guy once, real strange dude.  
He was a chef who made all kinda weird and exotic stuff.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
But the shiruko he made by stewing adzuki beans was exquisite! Oichi and Chacha both loved it!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
He dressed kinda weird, but he made delicious things, so Chacha loved him.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
But then he just disappeared one day... The horror.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Uh...this doesn't sound like a super-accurate version of history.  
  
   
**Purple-haired Tea Shop Girl:**   
I'm glad you are enjoying my food.  
  
   
**Purple-haired Tea Shop Girl:**   
Eh? Me? U-um...I am just an insignificant town girl, so please do not mind me.  
  
   
**Purple-haired Tea Shop Girl:**   
I did it! My part is done! (Victory dance)  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Huh? That flashy-looking girl seemed familiar...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, Chacha. You're spilling your shiruko. Come on now, wipe your mouth, too. And Senpai, please have some dumplings.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Hm. I thank you, boobie-somethingsomething.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Hey. Your dumplings look good too.  
Hand one to Chacha! Gimme!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
What's with all the commotion?  
  
   
**Villager:**   
Go take a look! The Oda and Shinsengumi folks are at each other's throats again!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...The Shinsengumi!?  
  
   
**E：???:**  
What's wrong with you!? Why are you getting in the way? You're being disrespectful to Oda Nobunaga, the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Shut up... It's the Shinsengumi's job to get rid of that...thing. Now die, all of you... If not, you'll all be exterminated!  
  
   
**E：Oda Nobunaga?:**  
Die or be exterminated? Eh? Isn't that the same thing?  
Just who is this fool!?  
  
   
**E：Oda Nobunaga?:**  
Dammit! I will not allow the galling lack of respect you've shown to me, the great Heroic Spirit Oda Nobunaga!  
  
   
**E：Oda Nobunaga?:**  
I am the unparalleled hero who will save Japan!  
Go, my elite Oda Bakufu goon squad!  
  
   
**Mini Nobu & Giant Nobu:**   
Nobunobu!  
  
   
**F：???:**  
Hmph. I don't care what you are!  
Just shut up and come at me!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That is...eh? N-Nobunaga?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Hm? Auntie is already here.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Th-there's another one of me...!? And not the bad me?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That one looks like a dude.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is it the real Lord Nobunaga? That means Nobbu is...  
   
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
No, no. I'm the real deal! If you're talking about the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Oda Nobunaga, then I'm the one and only!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's true that Oda Nobunaga is commonly regarded as male... Does that mean our Nobunaga was a fake?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Now we are learning the real historical truth...  
Even His Highness had no clue that Auntie was a phony!  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
Et tu, Chacha!?  
  
   
**Nobbu:**   
Argh! Okita! Say something! We're rivals, right?  
Tell them I'm the real Nobunaga!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...That's... No, it can't be...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Okita!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...M-Mr. Hijikata! It IS you, isn't it!?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...What's all this? ...Oh, Okita, it's only you.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Good timing. You go around from the right.  
Shinsengumi, advance!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I'm not ready! Wait, wait, what the heck's going on!?  
And who's the Nobbu lookalike!?  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga?:**  
Heh heh. I'm glad you asked! I am one who has returned from beyond the veil of death to this age of decadence...  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga?:**  
The Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Oda Nobunaga!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga?:**  
Oh-ho... So there's another me in this world.  
Who'd have thought it!  
  
   
**Oda Nobunaga?:**  
Hm? Do I hear a voice that stirs feelings of nostalgia...and yet that I really don't want to hear?  
  
   
**A：Oda Nobunaga:**   
What the what! It's you, Nobukatsu!  
  
   
**E：Oda Nobukatsu:**   
Oh crap! Big Sister!?  
  
   
**E：Oda Nobukatsu:**   
Arrrrgh...why are you here!?  
  
   
**A：Oda Nobunaga:**   
That's my line! Why are you here!? And why are you calling yourself the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven!? And why did you make a new Oda Bakufu!?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Ack! Look, I have a perfectly good explanation. You see, the people cried out for a shining hero to save this world from its decadent ways!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Now that you mention it, I think Mother told me that she and Auntie had a dead younger brother.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
At least I think she did.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Doesn't matter! Younger brother or not, taking my name is outrageous! I shall properly punish him!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Hey, girlie. That's my prey.  
Hands off.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Huh...? Who the heck are you?  
And do you know who I AM!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Mr. Hijikata!? That Nobbu isn't the bad Nobbu...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Well, she's not exactly a particularly good Nobbu either...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Okita! When did you get so soft!?  
Are you planning on ending your life in shame!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Just take my word and hold back for the time being, please! Nobbu, that's okay with you too, right? I beg of you too, Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's all just...try and be friends here...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Sigh) What a mess...  
   
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...Hmph. Fine. First we deal with Nobukatsu.  
Nobukatsu, where are you camped?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Lead the way. We'll talk when we get there.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Yes, Big Sister! This way! We, the army of the Oda Bakufu, will do our very absolute best! We'll work ourselves to the bone! Please show a little mercy!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Men, withdraw!  
  
   
**Mini Nobu:**   
Nobunobu!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Tch. Fine. Okita! Back to headquarters!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Eh? Headquarters? As in, the Shinsengumi's?  
U-uh, well...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
O-okay. Then, Master, please come with us!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
What? Fujimaru is obviously coming with me.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
What are you talking about!?  
Master is coming with me to Shinsengumi HQ!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Fool! Fujimaru is my retainer for all eternity!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
There's no way I'm handing Master over to a puny man-slayers club!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Who are you calling “puny”!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Come, Master. To the Shinsengumi with me.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
No! Fujimaru is coming with me!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Chacha knows what this is.  
This is what you call a lover's quarrel.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Chacha knows all about it. I've seen my fair share of them. Many people fight over Chacha's affections.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wh-what should we do, Senpai?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Join the Oda Bakufu.  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hm! That's my Master! Chacha, you come too!  
I will solve this matter in one fell swoop!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
B-but...! F-fine! Well...even if you say you want to join the Shinsengumi later, I'm not gonna let you!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Waaah! Master, you lawless ronin!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Goodbye. Now that I think about it, we didn't do any proper introductions, so farewell, frail-looking moe side character!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Join the Shinsengumi.  
   
**Okita:**   
Wonderful choice, Master. In that case, I shall train you until you are a worthy soldier of the Shinsengumi!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Wh-what...!? Are you declining to be my retainer!?  
E-even Monkey was super excited to serve me!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Fool! Even if you come groveling back to beg for my forgiveness, you... you may or may not get it!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Auntie... What an unexpected fall from grace.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Trying to be all tsundere isn't going to fly in this Azuchi-Momoyama period!  
  
   
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Eh? Chacha's going with you because you seem more interesting.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Actually, my feet hurt, so I just don't want to walk anymore.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
If you're going somewhere, give me a piggyback ride!  
Carry Chacha!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Th-this is turning out to be quite a bother, Senpai...  
  
   
## End Section: Let's Go, Our Oda Bakufu!  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hahahaha! I'd expect nothing less from my Master!  
That puny man-slayers club is no match for us!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Impressive, Lord Fujimaru!  
Such wonderful manipulation of Big Sister!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
With the funds we've collected, the new weapon for our great bakufu will soon be completed!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think I earned more than I meant to...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I feel bad for Okita.  
   
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Ha. I'm in a good mood, so I'll put dealing with Nobukatsu on hold for now. I'll think of a punishment after we beat that man-slayers club.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Aaand on a totally different note, don't you think this tea room is gaudy? Isn't it too shiny? There's not an ounce of elegant taste here.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
This is the same as His Highness's golden tea room.  
It brings back memories, but it's too flashy! Makes Chacha's eyes hurt!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Did Uncle Nobukatsu build this?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Eh!? Well, this room was given to me by our shogunate's sponsor, or something like that... Yeah, let's just go with that.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
What? So this is Monkey's preferred décor, huh?  
He did like sparkly things.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
I have prepared your room the same way, Lord Fujimaru, so please make yourself at home.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Big Sister, if you will excuse me... I am heading out for a meeting with a weapons merchant. Goodbye!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hm. Do as you see fit.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Okay! Maybe we should head over to that man-slayers club so we can make fun of their measly shack!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Auntie, too mean!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
But that seems fun, so Chacha's going too!  
Fujimaru, piggyback! Piggybaaack!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sure...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I hope Okita's okay.  
   
  
   
**Okita:**   
Of course I'm not okay!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Thanks to this event, the Shinsengumi's tight on funds for the first time since its establishment! Well, okay, it's kind of always been that way...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
All day long, we only eat a sad menu of rice with hot water and pickles... I wish I could have something sweet...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Quit your whining.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Rice with hot water and pickles is enough.  
It tastes fine.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
No, I think you just stockpiled too many pickles.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I mean, what's up with the storehouse being completely filled with pickles!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
It should have been filled with military provisions!  
Honestly, spending all our war funds on pickles...!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Man cannot live on pickles alone!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Argh. How does it happen that Mr. Hijikata and I are the only members of the Shinsengumi to manifest in this world!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
This isn't the Shinsengumi...  
It's like the Shinsen-pair!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Shut up. There's plenty of members.  
  
   
**Mini Nobu?:**  
Nobu!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
For the last time, what exactly are these Mini Nobus!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Eh? You're saying they're the righteous Mini Nobus who escaped because they started to question Oda's ways?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I didn't realize those things could be ambitious!  
Even if it's just a tiny bit...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Argh. If only Master had helped me out, something like this wouldn't have happened...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
(Worried cough)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, hey, Okita. How are you feeling?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Rice with hot water and pickles... How refined!  
   
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Hm? Aren't you...the brat hanging around Okita? What business does the dog of the Oda Bakufu have with us?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
M-Master!? You came!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I knew it...I knew it...  
Master's too smart not to see what an idiot Nobbu is!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
WRONG! Couldn't be further from the truth!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Fujimaru only came with me to make fun of this sad shack standing in this shanty city!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Whoa, so shabby! This place really is sad! Okita, if you stick around here, you'll die of a common cold!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Chacha also came to ridicule this place!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Huh... So this is what it looks like. Touring the city and seeing old, sad ruins like this is so hip and fun! Even if it is with the Shinsengumi!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
“Ruins”? “Shack”? You've gone too far this time, Nobbu!  
I will not allow you to deceive our purehearted Master!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Hey, quiet there. (Crunch crunch) If you're going to make a ruckus, do it outside. (Nomming on pickles)  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Please say something, Mr. Hijikata!  
  
   
**Nobusengumi:**   
Nobu, nobunobu!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Eh? What's this all of a sudden?  
Is there something you want to tell us?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Ah. The spy I sent into the city.  
Let's hear your report.  
  
   
**Nobusengumi:**   
Nobu! (Hands letter)  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Spying? I didn't know you guys were smart enough to do such advanced things.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hey wait a minute...  
Where do you get off sneaking away to betray me!?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
This is...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Okita! We're moving out! Prepare yourself! Quickly!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Eh? Did something big happen?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Yeah... Looks like some lawless ronin have gathered in a plot to torch Kyoto!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...And the secret meeting site is...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Could it be...!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I know!  
   
  
   
**Okita:**   
...The Ikedaya!  
  
   
## End Section: Go, Go! Everyone's Shinsengumi!  
   
**Okita:**   
We did it, Master! It's been a while,  
but this is a great victory for me!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
The Oda Bakufu is nothing more than a withering blossom that will bear no fruit. A weed!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
But, thanks to Master collecting so much for our war coffers, the Shinsengumi has reached new heights of wealth and power!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I...um, well, I'm kinda embarrassed to say that the Shinsengumi was never exactly financially stable.  
So this is like a dream come true!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hm, I think I ate too many apples.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I feel bad for Nobbu...  
   
  
   
**Chacha:**   
I'm sure Auntie's fine. Chacha has no reason to believe that, but Chacha does anyway!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Anyway, the Shinsengumi's so boooring.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Even your uniforms suck!  
Why don't you make them more sparkly!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Heh... Chacha doesn't seem to understand the greatness of this mountain pattern.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Well, it's Mr. Kondou's design, and I guess it really was a bit too flashy. So Mr. Hijikata hardly wore it.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Shut it, Okita. How was today's patrol?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Oh, Mr. Hijikata, what do you think?  
What do you think of my Master?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
As you can see, Master is a...um...master of collecting funds, and we're not so great at it. Why not let [♂ him /♀her]  
officially join as a member?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Hmph. I'm not so sure about that. Hey, you. I don't mind a little fundraising, but report to me about it first!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
If you don't, then...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
SEPPUKU!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
O-of course! I'm all about communication!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I-I actually used some to get materials...  
   
  
   
**Okita:**   
I-it'll be fine!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
As a senior officer, I will keep a watchful eye.  
Right, Master?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Got it. You...Try not to make Okita slice up her guts.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Well, what happened to your patrol? Get going!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Sheesh. He looks scary, and he's so bossy.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Well, Chacha wants to go shopping in the city,  
so let's go.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
(Sigh) But the other officers...  
  
   
**Nobusengumi:**   
Nobu!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
For the last time, what exactly are these Mini Nobus!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Eh? You're saying they're the righteous Mini Nobus who escaped because they started to question Oda's ways?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I didn't realize those things could be ambitious!  
Even if it's just a tiny bit...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
We use the tools we have.  
There's no rule that says our officers have to be human.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Uh... Why would there even need to be a rule for that!? It's just common sense!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Argh. How is it that Mr. Hijikata and I are the only officers of the Shinsengumi to manifest in this world!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
This isn't the Shinsengumi... It's like the Shinsen-pair!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
What do you think, Master? Only the First Unit has a captain, so there are a lot of open positions! You can't pass this opportunity up!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I-I think I'd rather join as a trial member...  
   
**Okita:**   
Oh...I see... Well, I can't force you.  
I will arrange it so that you join for a trial period.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Your meal plan isn't exactly a selling point...  
   
**Okita:**   
I'm sorry. Rice with hot water and pickles is Mr. Hijikata's favorite, so he's got barrels and barrels of it! An entire storehouse, in fact!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
P-please bear with us for another...six months or so! That's when it'll all run out!  
  
   
  
   
**Okita:**   
All right. I'm curious as to what Nobbu is doing right now, so shall we go on patrol, Master?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
First Unit Captain of the Shinsengumi, Okita Souji, heading out!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Ah! Sounds fun! Chacha's going too!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Um... The Shinsengumi's super-important, cutest MVP Chacha, out!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Should we slice something up for starters?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Trial officer, also moving out!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I wonder how Nobbu is doing...?  
   
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
How do you think, idiot!?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
The great Oda Bakufu is in financial trouble! As I was known as the Sengoku period's economics prodigy through my free markets and open guilds, this is just embarrassing!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Well, the idea of shaking down neighboring states because one is low on rice...is pretty much the oldest form of wartime economy...  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Nowadays, being international&ndash;like opening up the country or achieving cultural enlightenment&ndash;is the way to go.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Argh, don't talk to me like you know everything, you fool! And what's with this gaudy golden room!?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
The feeling's all off, and if you have money to spend on something like this, there's other things you should be doing!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
This wouldn't have happened if Fujimaru had just come to work for me...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh hey, Nobbu. How's it going?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Whoa, is Kintoki your decorator?  
   
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Well, well, if it isn't Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I knew you'd get tired of being a man-slayer&ndash;with all that dumb murdering&ndash;and become a wanderer dedicated to helping others, fighting bad guys...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...and that in the end you'd come to the realization that you should have sided with Nobbu, and so come crawling back to me!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Uh...no.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Master has come with me to patrol the city, and we just swung by to see what the Oda Bakufu stronghold looked like.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Oh, and Chacha mostly came to shop, but also decided to check things out here!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Whoa, this place looks gloomy...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
I'm so glad I didn't follow Auntie!  
Chacha can't handle being poor and stuff!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
From the look of this place, the glory of the Oda Bakufu is long gone!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Arrrgh! You puny man-slayer club dorks have no right to say that kinda crap! Nobukatsu! Hurry up and kick these folks out! Nobukaaatsuuuuuu!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hm? Where did he go?  
Argh, everybody keeps getting in my way!  
  
   
**Nobusengumi:**   
Nobunobbu! (Hands letter)  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Eh? What's this? Nobusengumi? Hey wait a minute...  
Where do you get off sneaking away to betray me!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
What is it? A messenger from Mr. Hijikata?  
A letter? Well let's see... Th-this is...!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Master! This is bad... Looks like some lawless roushi have gathered in a plot to torch Kyoto!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...And the secret meeting site is...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Could it be...!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I know!  
   
  
   
**Okita:**   
...The Ikedaya!  
  
   
## Section 3: GUDAGUDA Ikedaya Tumble  
   
**???:**  
We have received the shipment, and the funds will be wired to your account.  
  
   
**???:**  
Mmm. Leave the mass production to us from here on.  
  
   
**???:**  
Hmph. My company's products are much higher quality, you know.  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
What did you say!? Are you calling the United Satsuma Corporation's products inferior!? This volume, at these prices!?  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
I am the great Saigou Edimori, king of the United Satsuma Corporation! How dare you speak to me so disrespectfully!?  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
This is why bigheaded AC Choushu are so uncivilized...!  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
Well, I'm only stating the truth. Choushu Industries' products are far superior in terms of specifications!  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
Katsura Tesla, CEO, guarantees it!  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
I would appreciate it if you wouldn't lump us together with DC Satsuma's draconian employment conditions. Don't you think a 23-hour workday is absolutely barbaric?  
  
   
**???:**  
Please, both of you... Now is the time to cooperate in order to reach our mutual goal.  
  
   
**???:**  
United Satsuma's production skills and Choushu Industries' mysterious engineering... With their combined power, nothing can stand in our way!  
  
   
**???:**  
That's right! The ultimate union of technology: the SatChou Alliance!  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
Well if that's how our sponsor puts it... In service of the greater good, let us put aside our personal grudges. Right, Katsura?  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
Well, it is true that no invention would be possible without proper funding, Edimori.  
  
   
**???:**  
Fortunately, we are financially stable, so I'm looking forward to further collaborations. Hee hee hee hee.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
This is a raid!  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
Huh!? Who's there!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
First Unit Captain of the Shinsengumi, Okita Souji...  
in the flesh!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
You lawless roushi, I won't hesitate to slice you up if you resist!  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
What!? The Shinsengumi!?  
  
   
**???:**  
Oh crap... W-well then, I'm going to leave this to you SatChou leaders! I'm taking my leave!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...You're not going anywhere!  
  
   
**???:**  
Nobbu!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Wha...!? What the heck is this!? A Mini Nobu!? A robot!?  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
Hahaha! Behold! This is the great United Satsuma's wondrous creation, the “MN-01”...also known as Mecha Nobbu!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mecha Nobbu... They actually made one!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well, this isn't getting any less ridiculous.  
   
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
The best part is our production pace! We can make one every five minutes without so much as a drop of glue!  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
At my factory, these are mass-produced round the clock with our 23-hour workdays! It all boils down to numbers when it comes to battle, people of Japan!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...This is bad. There's just too many of them. Maybe splitting up with Mr. Hijikata wasn't such a good idea!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll be fine as long as we have you, Okita.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's scrap 'em before Hijikata shows up!  
   
  
   
**Okita:**   
...!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Leave this to me, Master!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Heh heh heh... My Kiku-Ichimonji shines with a different light tonight!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Whew. That was close. I almost got caught.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Who knows what would have happened if Big Sister had found out.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
She'd just start throwing around stuff like seppuku all willy-nilly.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
But if the SatChou lot manages to take her out for me,  
I can finally be the official head of the Oda clan!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
My rise to power is inevitable now!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
You're right... Inevitable.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Yep, totally inev&ndash;  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Oh crap! Big Sister!!! I-I, um, this is all according to keikaku... I-I mean, this is all just a big misunderstanding...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...  
You may be family, but you've exhausted my patience! Nobukatsu! You just wait right there!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Auntie... She's usually so soft on her family members... Even Ranmaru and Nagayoshi did whatever they wanted.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Well, I guess it's time to pay the piper.  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
Hold it right there, Mademoiselle Lord Nobunaga!  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
Behold! The Blavatsky Research Institute and my Choushu Industries worked together to develop...  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
...the “MNN-01”! Also known as the Nobbu UFO!  
  
   
**Nobbu UFO:**   
Nononono...bubububu!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Nobbu UFO!?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Argh, you're stealing my brand!  
You owe me for copyright infringement!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Ewww, they're creepy!  
  
   
**Nobbu UFO:**   
Nonoh!? Bubu!? (Crash)  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
Ah! Stop! They may not look it, but the Nobbu UFOs are extremely fragile (psychologically)!  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
So those schoolyard insults really sting!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
That was helpful, Katsura Tesla! I knew Choushu was better than those useless, shouty Satsuma barbarians!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
See you you-know-when, you-know-where,  
for the you-know-what!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Ah!? Hold it, Nobukatsu!  
Argh, these weird UFO-mes are so annoying!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...Haa!  
  
   
**Mecha Nobbu:**   
Nobaaaaaah!?  
  
   
**Mecha Nobbu:**   
Nobbu, nooobbu!  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
Wahahaha! There's plenty more of them!  
Looks like you're running low on fuel... Care to give up?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
(Pant...pant...) I'm still good! Master!  
Use a Command Spell! Let's get them in one swoo&ndash;  
  
   
**Okita:**   
(Cough!?)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okita!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Careful, Okita, the stairs...!  
   
  
   
**Okita:**   
Ah...!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...What do you think you're doing, Okita?  
This is no time to fall asleep on the job!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...M-Mr. Hijikata!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're saved!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okita...I'm glad you're okay!  
   
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Yes, hello. Fujimaru...was it?  
You've done well up until now. Leave the rest to us.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Everyone, draw your swords.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Let none escape!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
NOW IS THE HOUR OF  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
THE SHINSENGUMI!!!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Time to end this!!!  
  
   
**Mecha Nobbu:**   
No...buuuuun...  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
I-impossible... My entire fleet of Mecha Nobbus...eradicated... Annihilated!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Good... Tie him up.  
We'll interrogate him back at our base.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hey, are you guys all done here too?  
Looks like his buddy has given up too.  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
Sending an Archer to attack Riders seems quite unfair.  
The Nobbu UFOs were dropping like flies.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Chacha did good too!  
I shot flames out of my arms at them!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Wait a minute! Ahhh!  
Why do flames come out of Chacha's arms!?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...We'll interrogate that one at our place too.  
If you've no more business, begone!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
What!? That's our line. I'm taking that lion-head with me. You should be the one to skedaddle.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...So you're trying to take all the credit.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Would both of you please calm down...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
(Cough!)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can't we all just get along?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Uh-oh...those two are...!  
   
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
Ah-ha! Now's my chance!  
Blinding Edimori Shoulder Flash!  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
They don't call me the Fleeing Katsura for nothing!  
Behold! KT Body Flashbang!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Whaah! It's bright! My eyes!!! Chacha's eyes!!!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Ah! Chacha's mask to the rescue!  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
Wahahaha! We shall say farewell for now!  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
Note that my United Satsuma factory in Toba is rolling out tens of thousands of Mecha Nobbus as we speak!  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
And Choushu Industry Technics in Fushimi is also currently conducting tests with an even more powerful weapon! I suggest you prepare yourselves!  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori & Katsura Tesla:**   
Wahahahaha! We shall meet again!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Tch. This is all your fault. You let them escape...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
So their headquarters is in Toba-Fushimi...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hmph. Either way, the Oda Bakufu's going to kick all of their butts.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Fujimaru, we're leaving.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But Okita is...!  
   
  
   
**Okita:**   
I...am...fine.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I can...still...fight...  
  
   
## Section 4: Universal Battle of Toba-Fushimi  
   
**Chacha:**   
How is she? Has her fever broken?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Master... Chacha...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I'm at...headquarters?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...Oh right...this again...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Thank you for taking care of me... I'm fine now.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
(Cough!?)  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Yes, you sound muuuch better. You just stay right there in bed and don't worry about a thing.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Silly kids should listen to grown-ups.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Chacha will watch over you and make you all better!  
You just rest as much as you want!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yep, you need to lie down.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll bring rice porridge and pickles.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai. Do you have a moment?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where have you been?  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Sorry for disappearing so long.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...It's just, while you were heading towards the Ikedaya,  
I asked Da Vinci to perform an analysis of this realm...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'd rather not speak of it here. Is there somewhere we can talk privately?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Hm? Do as you please. Chacha will watch over her. Chacha is the best at nursing people back to health.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
If you say so... Take care of Okita, then.  
   
**Chacha:**   
Yes! Okita will get better in no time with Chacha on the case! If you want, Chacha can go on stage and sing lullabies.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're like a tiny mommy.  
   
**Chacha:**   
Don't say dumb things like that! Is it just 'cause Chacha is a Berserker!?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Just go do your thingy!  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
I had Da Vinci research this realm, and it apparently turned out to be a bit unusual...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey, how's it going? I wasn't really interested in doing this, but Mash insisted, so I performed an analysis.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What did you find out?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Isn't it the usual mess of a realm?  
   
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, I thought it was just like the last similar disaster you walked into, or just another Singularity...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But let me cut to the chase: this realm is in a kind of stasis.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Stasis... Does that mean time won't go forward?  
It can't move into the future?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's right. That place isn't a Singularity of a specific point in history, nor is it a time in history that's been altered.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It is just a single point in time that's unconnected to the past, and to the future.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I initially thought it was some parallel world's history that got derailed somewhere along the line.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But it's not. It's a world where time has stopped there, and ONLY there. If we think of human history as a narrative spanning thousands of volumes...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...then that world would be like a series that ended only a single volume. It is...entirely unrelated to human history.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A world that ends in a single volume...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The Guda Guda Particle is a fuzzy concept, but this is actually the opposite... I can sense an unwavering will behind this.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
A strong will that's saying “it ends here,” or “nothing beyond this point is necessary.”  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
You dummy!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That came from Okita's room!  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wait, Senpai!?  
We'll call you back, Da Vinci!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Wake up, Okita. It's time for battle. We are headed to Toba-Fushimi. The enemy has apparently gathered there.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Shut up, you muscle-brained, man-slaying, scary-faced jerk! She's in no shape to move! Get out!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I-I'm all right...! A burning fever is nothing to the powerful, invincible Okita...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
   
(Cough!?)  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
If you're coughing up blood, then you must have plenty to spare. Obviously your lungs are strong. Good, then. The Oda lot have already assembled. Let's go.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
No, no, no, it's not okay, dummy!  
...And you too!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Kids who catch a cold need to stay home and rest!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Thank you for being concerned for me, Chacha.  
But I...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I am the Shinsengumi's First Unit Captain, Okita Souji.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Now let's go, Master! I cannot allow Nobbu to be the only one to look cool!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okita...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Got it. Let's go.  
   
  
   
**Chacha:**   
...Oh come on! You military stooges are all the same!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
What's the point of pride and honor if they just get you killed!?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
You're all stupid! Stupid stupidheads! No! You know what you are? Stupid dum-dum doodyheads!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Argh! Chacha can't deal with you anymore! Chacha's gonna wreck all your dummy plans from now on!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Oh, but first, here's some medicine for you, dummy, so take it after you eat! Brats!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Chacha...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I wonder why she got so mad...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Hmph. If she were one of us, she would have to commit seppuku for deserting us before a battle.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Whatever. Shinsengumi, moving out.  
  
   
**Mecha Nobbu:**   
Nobu nobbuu!  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
Wahahahaha! What do you think of the new and incredible robot army that my United Satsuma has mass-produced for us!?  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
I had some time to tweak them a little, and so their production rate and performance went up by 20%! This is all thanks to our 24-hour workdays!  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
I see you're still not at all timid about breaking labor laws!  
  
   
**Nobbu UFO:**   
Nonononono bubububu!  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
And my new Choushu Industries superweapon is finally out of its prototype phase and in official production!  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
Even matchlock guns are no match against them!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
This is the indomitable strength of the Universal SatChou Alliance!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Heh. This will be the end of Big Sister's reign!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Why you... So many variants of me crawling all over the place...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hm? You guys are here too? What took you so long?  
Can't you see that the enemy's all locked and loaded!?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Huh? Fujimaru, wasn't Chacha with you?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She disappeared somewhere...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Something happened right before we left...  
   
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
She was tending to Okita on her sickbed...!?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I see... Oh, that Chacha...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
No matter. She'll be back when she gets hungry.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
And you're... Uh, Hijikata, was it? Of the Shinsengumi?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Well, what's your assessment of the enemy, then?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
There's too many... Our only options would be to pin them down with a feint, and then have a separate unit flank them...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Oh-ho... I thought your little man-slayers club was all about playing at being soldiers, but maybe I was wrong. I had more or less the same idea, in fact.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I guess you've got at least a little tactical sense.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
But you're a bit lacking in numbers.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...So what? You work with what you've got...  
That is what war is about.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Okita, you'll flank them.  
I'll handle the feint at their front ranks.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Underst&ndash;  
(Cough!?)  
  
   
**Okita:**   
N-no. It's fine! I'm fine!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
You are NOT fine.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Just hear me out: I'll lead the feint attack from the front. It's the best fit. Most of my troops carry matchlock guns, and aren't that mobile.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
That leaves everyone else free for the flanking maneuver. What do you think? Pretty cunning, huh?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A united front with Nobbu and the Shinsengumi!  
   
**Okita:**   
I-I see... That is a good idea, especially considering the source... We ARE understaffed... What do you think,  
Mr. Hijikata?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Eh!? Nobbu had a good idea!?  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
What's that supposed to mean!? I don't wanna brag, but pretty much never lost a battle! (*Note: Nobunaga lost the battle of Kanegasaki, but we don't talk about that.)  
  
   
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Fine. I guess that'll be better than losing...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Nobunaga... After all your big talk, you'd better not mess this up.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Of course. If you guys aren't careful, I'll take you all out together! So you'd better head out like you're planning not to come back!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Fujimaru, what are you going to do?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Cooperate with the Shinsengumi.  
   
**Okita:**   
If Master's with us, there's nothing to fear!  
Hijikata, let's go!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Cooperate with Nobbu.  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Haha! Now you'll get a real lesson in my famous Three Line Formation!!!  
  
   
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
This will be a glorious race to see who can win the greater honor on the battlefield!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Matchlock troops, ready yourselves!!!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Yes, a race to glory! We will not lose to the likes of her! Shinsengumi, advance!  
  
   
## End Section: We Won! Oda Bakufu Finishes!  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Now! Push them out! Matchlock troops, switch out and reload for the next shot! My invincible Noble Phantasm, Three Line Formation, will finish this!  
  
   
**Mecha Nobbu:**   
   
Nobbuaaaahh!?  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
I-impossible...!?  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
My United Satsuma-produced Mecha Nobbu unit is being completely annihilated!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Whoa! We're holding them back!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nobbu! You're amazing!  
   
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Of course! I am a tactical genius! Makes you wonder how come I don't have a better skill set, right? You know, it's never too late for that strengthening quest thing.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Fujimaru, you've done well too!  
Even Monkey's never done such a magnificent job!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Upon our victory, you'll be richly rewarded, and then make it DOUBLE! Wahahahaha! Unification under the great Oda Bakufu is so close I can taste it!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
We'll have a huge barbecue after-party at the temple when we're all done!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not at a temple, please.  
   
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Eh? R-really?  
But I'll make some tea and everything...?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
C-crap! She's too strong!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
N-no, maybe it's because of that...whatsitsname...Fujimaru?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Is [♂ he /♀ she] helping Sis...?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Fine. Change of plans!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Awww. So in the end, Auntie wins...  
I was all worried for nothing.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Sheesh. Leaving Chacha behind like that to go fight? Rude! Why are warriors and adults all like that?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Hm? Isn't that...Uncle Nobukatsu?  
Where's he running off to...?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
...Yes, I see... All we have to do is take out that Fujimaru [♂ guy /♀ girl]...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
...Who is he talking to?  
Shoot, I can't hear that well...  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Yes, that's right. If we can take care of that, Chacha can return to our great Taikou...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
...!? T-Taikou...!?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Who's there!? ...Oh, it's you, Chacha.  
You caught me in a bit of an awkward position here...  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Naughty Chacha...eavesdropping...  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
That's right. I was summoned to be His Highness Taikou's servant right from the beginning.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Now that you're here, I'm going to send you back to the castle.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Taikou... H-His Highness is in the castle!?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Th-that's impossible! His Highness is gone!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Oh, so you know.  
Death hasn't stopped either of us, has it?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
That's because this is THAT kind of world...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
N-no, no, no, no, no!!!  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
I've lost... I wasn't productive enough...  
Next time, I will try for 36-hour workdays...  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
(Sigh) War is truly terrible. All that work,  
and we even got help from Ms. Blavatsky...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Whew. It's finally done.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Yes! Now that we're all done, I'll put on a private production of my favorite play, Atsumori, back at the temple for everyone!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Master! Nobbu! I'm glad you're both safe. We finished mopping up the enemy forces on our end as well.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
To hell with all that!  
This operation's success was pretty much all me!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Ugh, it's so hard being me... That useless man-slayers club means I have to do ten times the work!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Whoa, those are fighting words.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
And you, Master!  
Why didn't you come with us!?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
All your bigheaded nonsense ends here, Big Sister!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Nobukatsu! You again!? What the heck!?  
Is it your life's work to be an annoying obstruction!?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Oh of course not. I am only doing what the true head of the Oda clan should be doing.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I see... The head of the Oda clan, you say.  
I will not permit such talk, even from my own brother!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I hope you know what you're getting into.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
U-uh, ahh! No, wait...! I'm a remarkably different person this time around! Can you still be so arrogant, even in the face of THIS!?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh no!  
   
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Chacha!? Is she unconscious?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Nobukatsu... How could you stoop so low!?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
And my true master is within that castle!  
The Great Gold Demon Taikou, Toyotomi Hideyoshi!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Toyotomi Hideyoshi...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Is it really Monkey!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Wow...so sparkly...  
That is a seriously garish castle...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Wait, that's probably not what matters now...  
What are you going to do with Chacha!?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
I shall see you at the castle, Big Sister!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Or rather, “Big Fool of Owari”!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Stop!!!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...Nobukatsu. Damn you...  
  
   
## End Section: The Key to Victory is Shinsengumi!  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Now! Draw your swords and attack!  
Destroy them all!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Death to SatChou! Special attack:  
Mugen Sandanzuki (AOE Noble Phantasm version)!  
  
   
**Nobbu UFO:**   
   
Nono, bubbuu!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Amazing, Shinsengumi!  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Quit dozing off, newbie!  
Push forward until we reach their general!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Eh? AOE Noble Phantasm?  
   
**Okita:**   
Oh, that was just a figure of speech. Anyway, I am in top shape right now! I'm feeling so strong, I might even start shooting beams today!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Eh? I can't? Oh dear...  
  
   
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
How could Choushu Industries' superweapon, the Nobbu UFO, be defeated by a bunch of common, low-tech troops?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
With Master and me working together, this is a cakewalk!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Mr. Hijikata, don't you think Master deserves a promotion to captain?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Hmph...don't lose focus.  
The battle's not over yet!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Wh-what the heck? That man-slayer rabble is too strong! Cannons and light beams aren't hitting them at all!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
N-no, maybe it's because of that...whatsitsname...Fujimaru?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Is [♂ he /♀ she] helping them...?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Fine. Change of plans!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Awww. So in the end, those dorks win... I got worried for nothing. Huh... I wonder if she took her medicine.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Sheesh. Leaving Chacha behind like that to go fight? Rude! Why are warriors and adults all like that?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Hm? Isn't that...Uncle Nobukatsu?  
Where's he running off to...?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
...Yes, I see... All we have to do is take out that Fujimaru [♂ guy /♀ girl]...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
...Who is he talking to?  
Shoot, I can't hear that well...  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Yes, that's right. If we can take care of that, Chacha can return to our great Taikou...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
...!? T-Taikou...!?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Who's there!? ...Oh, it's you, Chacha.  
You caught me in a bit of an awkward position here...  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Naughty Chacha...eavesdropping...  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
That's right. I was summoned to be His Highness Taikou's servant right from the beginning.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Now that you're here, I'm going to send you back to the castle.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Taikou... H-His Highness is in the castle!?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Th-that's impossible! His Highness is gone!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Oh, so you know.  
Death hasn't stopped either of us, has it?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
That's because this is THAT kind of world...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
N-no, no, no, no, no!!!  
  
   
**Saigou Edimori:**   
I've lost... I wasn't productive enough...  
Next time, I will try for 36-hour workdays...  
  
   
**Katsura Tesla:**   
(Sigh) War is truly terrible. All that work,  
and we even got help from Ms. Blavatsky...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
It's finally done. That took longer than expected. Okita! Collect the men. Shinsengumi, return!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Understood! Thank you as well, Master! Thanks to you,  
I only had three bloody coughing fits this time!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You overexerted yourself...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So that wasn't a C. Star collection skill?  
   
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Oh? I'm surprised you were able to defeat the enemy on your own.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
And you, Fujimaru!  
Why didn't you back ME up!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
That's our line! The sound of gunfire stopped halfway through the battle. What were you doing, Nobbu?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Well, you know, it started to rain,  
and our matchlocks got wet...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Nothing I can do about that, right?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Sheesh... Well, now Nobbu can finally appreciate the true strength of the Shinsengumi.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
This victory doesn't belong to me alone, but to all of the Shinsengumi!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
That is enough of your ridiculous arrogance, murderers club!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
You are...the clown from the Oda side...  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Who are you calling a clown!?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Well, I suppose a lowly jumped-up farmer couldn't be expected to appreciate my noble attire!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
What did you say? Come, say that to my face.  
Who did you call a jumped-up farmer...!?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Ah-ack!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
U-uh, ahh! No, wait...! I'm a remarkably different person this time around! Can you still be so arrogant, even in the face of THIS!?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh no!  
   
  
   
**Okita:**   
Chacha!? Is she unconscious?  
Nobukatsu...why...?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Chacha is part of your family!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Nobukatsu... How could you stoop so low!?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
And my true master is within that castle!  
The Great Gold Demon Taikou, Toyotomi Hideyoshi!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Toyotomi Hideyoshi...?  
One of the Three Unifiers of Japan?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Whoa... What the heck is that castle...? Yeah...that's definitely gaudy enough to be Monkey's castle...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Okay, that's probably not important now...  
What are you going to do with Chacha!?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
I shall see you at the castle, Big Sister!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Or rather, “Big Fool of Owari”!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Stop!!!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...Nobukatsu. Damn you...  
  
   
## Section 5: The Secret Emiyamaru  
   
**A：???:**  
Chacha...Chacha... Come back...  
Come back to me...Chacha...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
N-no! Chacha won't go back there!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
There's nothing left there...!  
  
   
**A：???:**  
Your children are here too... Tsurumatsu and Hideyori... Come back... Everything you desire is here...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
N-no...!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
I don't wanna!!!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
That Nobukatsu...  
I never imagined he'd do something so stupid...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I'm worried about Chacha...  
Let's hurry, Master!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Mr. Hijikata?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
What's with the scowl?  
I mean, you do always look like that, but still...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Demon Taikou... That voice I heard...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Mr. Hijikata...? Hello!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's so friendly with him...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Whoa, she's smacking Hijikata upside the head.  
   
  
   
**Okita:**   
Eh? Oh, Mr. Hijikata, Mr. Kondou, and I go way back.  
We're like family.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
When we were young, I used to make him cry all the time!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...So what is it, Mr. Hijikata?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
No...never mind.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Welcome, my elites of the Toyotomi Bakufu!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
To be able to command so many generals is something only the great Gold Demon Taikou, Lord Hideyoshi, could do!  
  
   
**Gotou Sétanta:**   
Hey, I have to deal with you guys again?  
  
   
**Mouri Medinaga:**   
Shut up. I could say the same to you!  
And why am I this Mouri character again!?  
  
   
**Mouri Medinaga:**   
Eh? This Mouri is completely different from the Mouri who ruled the Chugoku region? I don't care! I don't need to know inconsequential Warring States trivia!  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
Hmph...the red-armored Sanada. I see that you and I are not unrelated. I do have a bit of sympathy for his story.  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
His title&ndash;“The Land of the Rising Sun's greatest warrior”&ndash;may be a bit much for me, though.  
  
   
**Gotou Sétanta:**   
You seem a little...overenthusiastic about this...and what's with that mask?  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
Are you asking about my Rokumonsen? These are to pay the ferryman of the River Styx, which represents a Sanada warrior's resolve to&mdash;  
  
   
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**   
I see. Thank you for that oh-sooo-interesting tidbit!  
But no more useless trivia!  
  
   
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**   
We have assembled because we heard there is a Spring Saber Annihilation Festival being held to thin out the overpopulated Sabers!  
  
   
**Akashi Ex:**   
...And I suggest we ignore anything this silly girl says. Please, pay her no mind.  
  
   
**Akashi Ex:**   
... (Nom nom)  
(These Akashiyaki dumplings are delicious.)  
  
   
**Mouri Medinaga:**   
I see we have two new faces!  
  
   
**Mouri Medinaga:**   
Oh, but that girl in the black outfit is cute.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Now then, Sun Fortress Five! I'm leaving this place in your hands! I'm off to offer Chacha to Lord Taikou!  
  
   
**Gotou Sétanta:**   
...Um, are we good with this?  
The little lady will die...  
  
   
**Mouri Medinaga:**   
She was so cute too...  
It's unfortunate, but there's nothing we can do.  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
Ah...we Servants have no choice but to obey the one who summons us. And that man...  
  
   
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**   
No, but still...  
Wait, more importantly, what's “Chousokabe”?  
  
   
**Gotou Sétanta:**   
Hey. The enemy's here... My heart's really not in this, but I guess we don't have a choice...  
  
   
**Gotou Sétanta:**   
Time to show you the fighting prowess of this so-called reincarnation of Marici!  
  
   
**Gotou Sétanta:**   
...I still don't know why I'm the only one with a childhood name, but whatever...  
  
   
**Mouri Medinaga:**   
Hee hee... They'd better not underestimate the power of the Servants who got their animation updates!  
  
   
**Mouri Medinaga:**   
When it comes to breathtakingly beautiful  
☆3 Casters, I am the very best!  
  
   
**Mouri Medinaga:**   
Not holding back with my Hekate Graeae will be wonderful stress relief!  
  
   
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**   
I'm not really sure about this... Huh!? I'm detecting a crudely made, overproduced, inferior unit born of mass production Saber response!  
  
   
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**   
How come Sakura Saber gets to be a ☆5 Saber and I'm stuck as an Assass&ndash;(Cough, cough)  
  
   
**Akashi Ex:**   
(Huff, huff) (This shiruko is good, too.) Japanese sweets are wonderful... They fill my heart with sugary goodness.  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
Hm...the enemy is coming from the front, while the castle that we must protect is behind us. We all know what to do.  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
Hey everyone. Back away a bit.  
I'm doing this&mdash;  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
...I am the bone of my sword.  
  
   
**Gotou Sétanta:**   
Hey, what the hell are you doing!? Whoa!  
  
   
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**   
Th-this power...!?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
The more I look at it, the more absurdly overwrought this castle looks! As their former boss, I am embarrassed for them! They lack wabi! They lack saaabiii!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Even the great Rikyu is spinning in his grave.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
We've almost reached the Sun Fortress, or whatever it's called. That's where they're keeping Chacha.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Fortunately, it's situated on level terrain. Easy to attack, difficult to defend. This will be an easy win, Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um, actually...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is that...  
   
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hm? What's that sound? An earthquake?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Ehhhhhh!? Th-that's!?  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
This is Sanada's pride and joy: Super Fortress...  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
...Emiyamaru!  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
I have no intention of losing!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
What the actual hell is that!? Well, taking the castle's position into consideration, the fort's placement is tactically sound...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
That red-masked weirdo...  
He's not one to be taken lightly!  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
Ha. Such praise from the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven is an honor!  
  
   
**Mouri Medinaga:**   
Eh? Don't tell me you're a Warring States buff?  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
No, but the Heroic Spirit that has fused with me is shouting within me. Shouting that I must protect that castle.  
  
   
**Gotou Sétanta:**   
Yeah, I actually agree with you. I wonder why... This feeling... It's not really regret... It's almost like a sense of pride bubbling up...  
  
   
**Mouri Medinaga:**   
I hate things like that! Things like pride and romanticizing warfare... Men are so dumb!  
  
   
**Mouri Medinaga:**   
Although... Was I Mouri Medinaga?  
I do feel like I need to try my best here for some reason.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Mouri? Does that mean you're Choushu...?  
  
   
**Mouri Medinaga:**   
Oh! Are we doing that bit now!?  
  
   
**Mouri Medinaga:**   
No, I may be Mouri, but apparently I'm not THAT Mouri! Honestly, I don't really know the details.  
  
   
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**   
...Hee hee... This place will be the death of you!  
  
   
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**   
The amazing Warring States Space Battlemaiden, Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X, shall punish the counterfeit Saber!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Chousokabe...? Which means...Tosa...?  
  
   
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**   
Eh? Is that not my style? Am I not someone who says stuff like “KILL SABER” and that kinda thing?  
  
   
**Akashi Ex:**   
...X...just stop.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
It doesn't matter! SatChou and Tosa must die!  
There will be no mercy!  
  
   
**Gotou Sétanta:**   
I'm so glad we get to stay out of this for a change.  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
Uh, I'm not sure if that's true.  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
Anyway, you will all experience the true terror...  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
...of my Emiyamaru!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Gotou Sétanta:**   
...Sheesh. This went just like last time...  
  
   
**Gotou Sétanta:**   
Oh, well. Nothing for it. Hey, next time can I at least go by something other than my childhood name?  
  
   
**Mouri Medinaga:**   
Eh? Some say that it was Mouri, not Sanada, who was the true master of strategy in the Osaka battle?  
  
   
**Mouri Medinaga:**   
I said I don't care!  
  
   
**Mysterious Chousokabe Heroine X:**   
I can't believe some phony Saber defeated my Meteor Sword... It was all because we didn't make any decisions...  
  
   
**Akashi Ex:**   
For my payment of Japanese sweets, I think I did good... (Nom nom) (Maybe I'll try out okonomiyaki on my way back?)  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
Heh... I knew this would happen.  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
I suppose we lost because I compromised the citadel's walls by driving spears through them to look cool...  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
...Hurry. You are the only ones who can save that girl.  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
It seems the Heroic Spirit who has fused with me also wants that.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Sanada Emimura&ndash;no, Sanada Yukimura&ndash;is Chacha's...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Eh? Who is this guy? Is he famous? Sanada?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Oh, Sanada, the former retainer of Takeda? Now that you mention it, I think he left me his horse right before I died...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I don't remember much but... Eh? His son?  
  
   
**Sanada Emimura:**   
You've messed everything up. It's your fault that I had to go through hell... That's what the Heroic Spirit within me seems to think...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That was a tough battle...in many ways!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sanada Emimura... “Greatest warrior” indeed.  
   
  
   
**Okita:**   
A-anyway, all that's left is that Sun Fortress!  
Let's hurry, Master!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Sheesh... The Sun Fortress Five wasn't good for anything except buying a little time. Now I have to deal with Big Sister and the Shinsengumi...  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
No, wait! The real threat is you, Fujimaru! You're the one who unified the two groups!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Nobukatsu! How dare you continue to scurry around causing mischief!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Hah! Unfortunately for you, the stalling was effective! Chacha has already been sacrificed and the Great Gold Demon Taikou has revived!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Now, behold! The paradise of death!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Radiant Demon Fortress of the Sun!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Wh-what the...? Is space shifting?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...Wh-what's going on!?  
  
   
## Section 6: GUDAGUDA Final Battle, Fortress of the Sun  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Is there...a huge amount of magical energy pouring out of Monkey's castle?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Whoa!? That tasteless, shiny castle is getting even worse!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Wh-what is going on?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
We saw this last time... Which means...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai, we figured it out!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash!? Eh? Are you calling from Chaldea?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wait, when did you...!?  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
There were a few things I wanted to look into, so I returned to Chaldea to analyze them with Da Vinci.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry to have left you without telling you.  
But please forgive me, in the Guda Guda way...!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Explain later!  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Let me get right to the point! There is a Demon God Pillar at the core of that demonic castle!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
A Demon God Pillar!?  
Weren't those things completely destroyed?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
As in THOSE Demon God Pillars!?  
What does that mean...?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Do you know why, Da Vinci!?  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Thanks for that to-be-expected reaction.  
Of course, I am a genius, after all.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So what is there, to be blunt,  
is the corpse of a Demon God Pillar.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Specifically, the carcass of the Demon God Pillar that died in that Singularity somehow ended up there, and somehow carved that space out of time itself.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Or maybe it fled while it was near death, and ultimately made it there.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Whichever the case, we haven't been able to determine why it meddled with space-time there.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We do know that it is somewhat different than the ones we encountered before, so please be careful, Senpai!  
  
   
**Gold Demon Taikou Hideyoshi:**   
I am Hideyoshi, the Gold Demon Taikou!  
An eternal golden paradise shall be created here!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
...Do you see, Big Sister!? A new almighty savior has been born from the Demon God Pillar's remnants!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
And within this space, the Great Gold Demon Taikou is going to grant the blessing of eternity to mortals everywhere, and so save them all!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Big Sister, this will allow you to be free of the obligations that come with being an Oda, and you can go back to the carefree life you lived before!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Nobukatsu... Did you...do all this for me...?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Why, of course!  
Nobukatsu always has Big Sister's back!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Those dumb chief retainers of the Oda clan knew nothing!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Not acknowledging Big Sister because you were a woman!? Unforgivable! That's why I did all of this!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
And as a result, you purged them all, and they became...that!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
You're brilliant! You were the obvious successor of the Oda clan! There is no way I could have fulfilled that role!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
...Because I was incompetent!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Nobukatsu...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Nobukatsu...  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Now, everyone must die, and then eternity will be all that remains. The bonds of the Oda will be pointless!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
There will be no need to think of the future!  
You just have to retain your current happiness!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
If you don't eliminate neighboring states, your own state will be destroyed... We're forced to fight needless battles just for the sake of territory!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
There's no need to return to that crazy era anymore!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Big Sister! Let us stay in this enclosed space and live our carefree childhood lives forever!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...I'm sorry, Nobukatsu.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
...Eh?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I drove you into a corner that time...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
If only I had made a decision sooner, I could have sent you to a temple where you may not have lost your life.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Wh-why...why are you apologizing? There should have been no question that the only one worthy to take over leadership of the clan was you, gifted as you are.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Father forced everything upon you! He is to blame!  
This is how it should be, Big Sister! You can be free now!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Guess it can't be helped!  
Nobukatsu, I'm gonna have to put you in the ground.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
...What do you mean? I am trying to create a world where we can enjoy our lives like in our childhood...  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
I guess I have no choice but to convince Big Sister of the value of what I'm doing...  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
You can reflect on that while you're crushed in wave after wave of infinite carcasses! We have all the time we need!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Sorry, Fujimaru, would you do something about all these flunkies?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I'm gonna deal with my little brother personally.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Hey! Wait! Don't forget about me!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Whatever weirdness you're up to is none of my business, Nobbu. But maybe we can still save Chacha!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Idiot... Hey, Hijikata of the Shinsengumi, was it?  
I'll leave you in charge here. You can handle this, right?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Hmph, shut your trap. You talk too much. No matter who we face, if they stand in the way of the Shinsengumi...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...we will cut them to ribbons!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
No matter what the opponent, huh? Fine!  
I'm counting on you, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
To hell with an eternal world for the Toyotomi Bakufu! Foolish! Listen up, Nobukatsu!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
A man's life is but fifty years...  
It is but a dream... in the great order of things.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
What makes humans so awesome is that they shine brilliantly in their short lives! Burn this image into your eyes, and your mind!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Bear witness to how Oda Nobunaga, the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, lives!  
  
   
## Section 7: Farewell, Loving GUDAGUDA World  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...We're finally here.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Ugh, they didn't hold back when it came to making more Mini Nobus.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
...I guess I was no match for Big Sister...  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Why must I always fail so hard...  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
I'm so bad, sometimes I question whether I'm really related to Big Sister.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hey, don't say that. If there's anything to blame, it's the era we lived in. It's nobody's fault. It was just the times!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
I suppose...  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
But I will accept any punishment Big Sister has for me.  
It is only right. Just do it quickly. I don't like pain...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...Very well. Goodbye, Nobukatsu.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait a minute!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Stay, Nobbu!  
   
  
   
**Okita:**   
Nobbu...!?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Eh? Huh?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
...Big Sister?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Geez. I really am a softie when it comes to family.  
Just who I am, I guess.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nobbu...I knew you'd do the right thing.  
   
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
BIIIIIIG SIIISSSTEEERRR...!  
I...I...! (Cling)  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Arrgh! Don't touch me! That's disgusting!  
Besides, we still have another boss fight to deal with!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Oh yes... The remains of the Demon God Pillar&ndash;or rather, the Gold Demon Taikou!  
  
   
**Gold Demon Taikou Hideyoshi:**   
I am Hideyoshi, the Gold Demon Taikou...!  
I offer eternal life...!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Shut up, demon trash! And come on, Chacha!  
Take off that mask and wake up already!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
You and I share the same noble Oda blood! No Oda could ever die so easily! This shouldn't phase you at all!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
...A-Auntie?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Chacha! What a relief!  
She hasn't been completely consumed!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
N-no, you don't understand, Auntie. This is all Chacha's fault. His Highness, Tsurumatsu, Hideyori...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Those who had tried to protect the Toyotomi family...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
They are all blaming Chacha... Calling me the woman who destroyed Toyotomi... A horrible, wicked woman...! The obsession of a deranged Toyotomi!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Those words are boiling up from within me...  
Just like that day...forever and ever!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Ah, so that's what Monkey thinks...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Listen, Chacha. I know Monkey very well. He was naive yet calculating, emotional yet unequivocal, and truly coldhearted.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
A man who was unquestionably two-faced, and yet he shone with glory. He was a man like the sun itself.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
It was only natural for him to succeed me as ruler.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
But there is one thing he couldn't do!  
And Chacha, you know very well what that is.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
And that is:  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
He couldn't say no to the woman he fell for!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Auntie...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Th-that's right! His Highness was always kind to Chacha! Always and only to Chacha!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
So that voice I hear coming from the pillar is...!?  
  
   
**Gold Demon Taikou Hideyoshi:**   
Why... Why do you refuse... Toyotomi... Your children... They can live on forever...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
And now our eyes are open to the tru&ndash;AHHH SO MANY EYES!!!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Whatever. It's just a stupid jerk that tried to deceive and devour Chacha.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Huh, what do you mean?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
That thing really is the carcass of a Demon God Pillar.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
During the battle with Solomon, it must have developed some self-awareness.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
What happens when a living thing becomes aware of itself? Naturally, it begins to fear its eventual demise.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
While the other Demon God Pillars stayed on the battlefield following orders, this one fled its post... Because it wanted to live.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
However, weak as it was, it was unable to stave off death. And so it drew it last breath&ndash;here. Now, only its vindictive desires remain.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Wait, YOU figured this all out? I mean, you're right... That's basically the residual thought patterns of a Demon God Pillar that took shape.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It may just be a corpse that drifted here, but it's still a Demon God Pillar. Even that shell is a powerful magical tool.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The Demon God Pillar resonated with the powerful desire not to die, then fused with that very desire and materialized as something similar to a Grail.  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It's like a nasty parasite. It can't maintain its existence without using the Spirit Origin of a Heroic Spirit as a catalyst.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So if we separate Chacha from it,  
this realm will go back to normal!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Da Vinci, yes!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thank you, too, Mash!  
   
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Let's put an end to this, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Chacha, we'll get you out of that piece of trash soon!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just hang in there, okay?  
   
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Auntie... Fujimaru...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Okay! Chacha will wait!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Let. Go. Of. Chacha! Lemmego!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Oh, right! Chacha can shoot fire from her hands.  
Wanna get burned?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Good. Sounds like the chitchat's done with.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
All we have to do is slice it up, right?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
THEN LET'S GET TO IT!!!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Mr. Hijikata... It's always like this with you...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Anyway, let's end this!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
To be honest, I'm running kinda low on HP myself...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
(Cough!?)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go, everyone! Final boss battle time!  
   
**Okita:**   
Come, to the decisive battle!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The Oda and Shinsengumi working together...We are the O-Shin Alliance!  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hm! It's gonna get a taste of our powers combined!  
  
   
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**   
I...I don't want to die... I don't want to die...  
I don't want to die here...like this...  
  
   
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**   
I just want to keep living...somewhere...  
Alone in my own world...  
  
   
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**   
I don't need purpose. No ideals or conviction.  
No subjugation or rule. No pursuit or development. No camaraderie or parting... None of it.  
  
   
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**   
I just...wanted to relish this newfound sense of self...a bit longer.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Hm? Where am I...?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Chacha remembers getting enveloped in flames that day...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
I see. So this is what hell's like...  
  
   
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**   
I don't want to die... I don't want to die...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Wh-what are you!? A D-Demon God Pillar!?  
D-don't come near Chacha...!  
  
   
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**   
Chacha...? This record... You destroyed Toyotomi...?  
I see... You're going to die too...  
  
   
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**   
I will die soon... And so I...I understand how you feel. Give me your hand... If I fuse myself with you, then we'll...!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
S-stop! Ch-Chacha is not the one who destroyed Toyotomi!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Chacha tried to save Hideyori...!  
  
   
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**   
Ah...you were branded a liar, and a woman who brought destruction in later history... You are a fitting vessel for me to inhabit...  
  
   
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**   
O woman who denies destruction, as one who turns her back on it, you are truly fitting as my accomplice.  
  
   
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**   
O infernal princess, your powerful sense of shame was the beacon that guided me through the sea of death.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
N-no! Chacha isn't a destroyer! Or an infernal anything!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Chacha...Chacha just...  
  
   
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**   
...Disappear... She will disappear... The woman who rejected destruction will never accept eternity.  
  
   
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**   
...I do not understand humans.  
Life is incomprehensible. But...  
  
   
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**   
One thing has become clear to me. Biological activity without purpose is no true voyage; it is merely drifting...  
  
   
**Demon God Pillar Andras:**   
...And I...simply failed to properly order my goals and purposes in this brief existence...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Th-that was a close one, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Good work saving Chacha!  
Make Auntie give you a reward!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Cut the crap.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
We wouldn't even BE in this mess if you hadn't gotten yourself captured by that Demon God Pillar...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Now, now. All's well that ends well.  
We should be happy that everyone's safe and sound.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Well, Big Sister, I think this is goodbye...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Huh? Nobukatsu!? Why are you fading away!?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Well, you know, I'm pretty insignificant,  
so I don't exactly qualify as a Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
It was only thanks to the Demon God Pillar that I was able to maintain my Spirit Origin.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
You all went to great lengths to save me,  
but I think this is the end.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Nobukatsu...  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Oh come on, Big Sis.  
I am not the sort of brother who should be missed.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
I'm the dumb little brother whose jealousy of his amazing Big Sister started this whole insurrection.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
I see... You're right...  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Okay, bye then!  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Oh come on! I'm disappearing forever and THAT'S the best you can manage!?  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
Ah, Big Sister. Just one last thing.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...What is it? Come on, spit it out.  
  
   
**Nobukatsu:**   
...I leave THE REST to you, Big Sister.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Wh-what!? Don't give me that crap, you dummy!  
Who uses the same last words TWICE!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nobbu...  
   
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Sorry to cut into this...“touching” moment, but...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...the Demon God Pillar that created this realm has disappeared. We'd better get you all out of there.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right! Please hurry, Senpai!  
If you stay there, like last time, the space will...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh? It's not collapsing...  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Eh? You're right. Why's that? Could there still be a shard of the Demon God Pillar somewhere?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Eh!? Does Chacha still have a chunk of that weirdo thing on her, Fujimaru?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...No, that's not it.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Right, Shinsengumi!?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Hmph. Seems that way.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Eh? M-Mr. Hiji...kata...!?  
  
   
## Epilogue: Shinsengumi  
   
**Okita:**   
Mr. Hijikata... Why...?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
It's simple. That Hijikata Toshizo guy is also a Heroic Spirit that the Demon God Pillar summoned.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...Am I right?  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
...After hearing your conversation, it seems that way.  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
On that fateful day, I was shot at Hakodate...and the next thing I knew, I was here. Does that mean the Demon God Pillar consumed me, too?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Not necessarily. That thing called out for those who share its desires, and maintained this space.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
You're just one of the keystones that made this space, all the while being a Rogue Servant who didn't need the power of the Demon God Pillar.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
If it had consumed you, I'm sure this place would have been a much more hellish battlefield.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Anyway! Your version of immortality doesn't seem to quite match up with the Demon God Pillar's.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Isn't that right, Hijikata? You're the epitome of stubborn refusal to back down. Besides, you're not the kind of wuss who'd let someone else control your Spirit Origin.  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
Heh. I suppose I should be honored to get a seal of approval from the lord of the Sengoku period.  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
Oh hey. Now that I've got a good look at you,  
I can see you're quite a beauty.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
This is no time to joke around!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Actually, if we can just talk Mr. Hijikata down, this'll sort itself out, and he'll come back to his senses, right?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
That's not possible. Even the Demon God Pillar couldn't release the man from madness.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Hey, Hijikata... You didn't even realize you turned into a Heroic Spirit after you died, did you?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
You wandered that strange battlefield, all that time projecting your desires toward the Grail&ndash;toward the Demon God Pillar.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
The whole time, all you were thinking was:  
“I can't die here. I won't be killed until I win.”  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Probably. The Grail grants people's wishes. As the one who wished on it, his desire was what shaped that realm.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
That can't be... Does that mean Mr. Hijikata intended to continue living, to embody the Shinsengumi forever...?  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
I get it now... There was something...odd that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Now it's all clear.  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
...In other words...  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
You're all trapped here until I die.  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
Am I right, Demon King of the Sixth Heaven?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
...Yeah.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
So what are you going to do, Okita?  
If it's too hard for you, I can do it...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Please be quiet, Nobbu!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Mr. Hijikata! Why!?  
Do you not realize that you've died!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
That's not right! Because...  
Because the Shinsengumi's already&mdash;  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
Shut up, Okita!!!  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
Listen to me! The Shinsengumi will never end...  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
Kondou...Nagakura...Saitou...  
In the end, they were all gone.  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
...But don't worry.  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
Me... As long as I'm around,  
the Shinsengumi will never end...  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
Right here...!  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
I am...!  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
...THE SHINSENGUMI!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
No...!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
You're... You're wrong...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, THIS is Okita's Shinsengumi...! Here with us!  
   
  
   
**Okita:**   
Master!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Wh-what do you mean...?  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
Well, well... You've got guts, newbie.  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
Or rather, Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
You stand here, before ME, the Vice Commander of the Shinsengumi, Hijikata Toshizo...  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
...and YOU dare to tell ME where the Shinsengumi is!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Master...!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
That's right...!  
Right now, I am Master's sword!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Mr. Hijikata!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
My makoto&ndash;my sincerity&ndash;is right here!  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
Hey Okita, for someone who quit because she was sick, you're talking awfully big now.  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
So be it. If you're ready to live and die by that belief, then rest assured, you'll have no mercy from me!  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
Your banner or my Shinsengumi... We're going to decide which is the real Shinsengumi right here!  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
Let's go!  
  
   
**Hijikata Toshizo:**   
SHINSENGUMI, ADVANCE!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Okita:**   
... (Pant, pant, pant)  
  
   
**B：Hijikata Toshizo:**   
...Your sword is still as deadly as ever.  
  
   
**B：Hijikata Toshizo:**   
Ever since we were kids, I've always known the power of your sword...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Mr. Hijikata...! I... I...!  
  
   
**B：Hijikata Toshizo:**   
I see... So, you've planted your banner at [♂ his /♀ her] side, then...  
  
   
**B：Hijikata Toshizo:**   
But no matter what happens...  
  
   
**B：Hijikata Toshizo:**   
...my Shinsengumi...will NEVER die!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...!  
  
   
**B：Hijikata Toshizo:**   
I'll be seeing you, Okita...  
  
   
**B：Hijikata Toshizo:**   
You keep that makoto banner of yours flying high, Okita. Always.  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Sheesh. He didn't change one bit; not even at the end. Guy had some serious conviction, especially for a Berserker.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Mr. Hijikata...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Eh!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Wait a minute! Mr. Hijikata was a Berserker?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Eh? You didn't notice?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well, that was pretty convincing.  
   
  
   
**Okita:**   
What? No! He was definitely a Saber, or even an Archer, right!? What kind of group would the Shinsengumi be if the vice commander were a Berserker!? Huh!?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Hellooo! Chacha's being completely left out of the loop! Don't you think that's bad? BAD???  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
No matter how you look at it, Chacha's obviously the real heroine here. So...really!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, now that Hijikata has been defeated, the space around you is starting to collapse! Get back to Chaldea now!  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Oh, I forgot! Everyone, follow me! If we all get back safe and sound, we'll have a barbecue at the temple!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Chacha wants to see Auntie's strange Atsumori play!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
It's creepy, but Chacha loves it!!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...Mr. Hijikata...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
As long as my banner is still here...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I'll... I'll keep on fighting!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go...!  
   
  
   
**Okita:**   
Yes, Master!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Well... I guess there's nothing left.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
I can't hear the sounds of the battlefield.  
I can't even see the road that leads back to Hakodate.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Damn. That idiot Okita claims I died...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...I see. So it's true; I did die...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
I took off my haori, picked up a gun, and just...fought.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
But in the end, I was driven to the far north...and wound up like this.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Pathetic. This feeling makes my stomach churn with rage so much, it feels like it might even be able to bring me back to life.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
I haven't failed my makoto, yet my body has failed me.  
And that is...infuriating.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...But not half as much as the fact that Okita,  
idiot that she is, defeated me...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Well, yeah...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
The stupid girl, who sat on the veranda that day just staring absently up at the sky, acts like such a big shot now.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
That's just how I remember her from Kondou's dojo... The girl we all laughed about because none of us ever thought we could beat her.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
I'm glad I could see her like that again.  
Might as well steel myself and go... Hm?  
  
   
**Demon God Andras:**   
...Are you still here? This space is collapsing.  
You should leave before you get stuck.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
You're a Demon God Pillar, right? I would have expected you to try and drag me down with you. But...are you concerned about me?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
If only I'd been more compatible with you, this world would've been better fortified and defended.  
  
   
**Demon God Andras:**   
Correct. That's nothing more than a regret now, though. But thanks to you, I did learn one thing.  
  
   
**Demon God Andras:**   
To die while lamenting the life that has been lost...  
  
   
**Demon God Andras:**   
That was the one saving grace I received as I gained self-awareness.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...  
  
   
**Demon God Andras:**   
But you are different.  
  
   
**Demon God Andras:**   
I will disappear at the end of my drifting, while you will disappear at the end of your battle.  
  
   
**Demon God Andras:**   
That is the fate that was engraved onto your Spirit Origin. And so, it is not yet time for you to die.  
  
   
**Demon God Andras:**   
My beacon. My horizon. O Berserker soldier who witnessed the end of my drifting.  
  
   
**Demon God Andras:**   
Keep fighting. Fight for the sake of your makoto,  
even though you know you cannot be saved.  
  
   
**Demon God Andras:**   
This shall be your punishment for redeeming my evil, even for a brief moment, and my final wish made in this life.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Hmph.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...There's no need to point it out. No matter how much I get beaten down, I'm the sort of stubborn ox who will keep fighting until I win.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
I'm aware that the Shinsengumi may never win in history. I remained a Wolf of Mibu until the very end.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
But my&ndash;no, the Shinsengumi's&ndash;makoto will never fall. No matter what battlefield we find ourselves on, no matter what kind of hell it's in.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Fine. Dead or alive, I'll show them what it means to be a Berserker.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Should a voice ever call out to me in a summoning,  
I'll charge in and roar with all my might!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You went through a lot this time around, Senpai.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah. That was even worse than last time.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway, let's take a break until our next assignment. Why don't I make you some tea since we have a bit of time?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nice. Let's have that food we got from Kyoto too.  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wh-what is this...!?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Oh hey! Why, if it isn't Fujimaru!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Plain and boring rooms are not Chacha's style, so I tried reproducing that golden tea room from the other day. Chacha did good, huh?  
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Well...this is no good.  
Needs more wabi-sabi.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, that's not what I mean...! First of all, why is everyone messing around in Master's room!?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Well you see, I used up all my NP during our last battle...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
I can't go anywhere for a while, so please let me recuperate in Master's room.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Oh, if you're going to be making tea, go light, please.  
And some sweets would be nice.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Chacha too! Chacha too! U-um, cups, cups, cups...  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Well, I guess this thing I stole from the Demon God Pillar right before we left might work...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Eh? Isn't that a Grail?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Good work...!  
   
  
   
**Chacha:**   
What? You can have it if you want it.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
That cup is not Chacha's style anyway.  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
So! Fujimaru! Now that Chacha's at this Chaldea place, you'll never be bored!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Now you have luxurious barbecued meals with Chacha every day to look forward to!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
You're already looking forward to it, right? Right!?  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
...Sooo! Mash, or whoever you're supposedta be! Chacha is already bored! Entertain Chacha! Do something fun!  
  
   
**Chacha:**   
Vee-are? I hear there's something called Vee-are?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai! Please say something!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Right...um...  
   
  
   
**Nobunaga:**   
Well, it can't be helped!
