# Nerofest Autumn 2019  
   
## Return of Nero Fest - Autumn 2019 (First Half)  
   
**Nero:**   
Ah-hem!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Uh...uh... Testing, testing.  
Okay, everything's fine. All right, here we go.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
A festival is...  
  
   
**Nero:**   
A party that brings joy to all people,  
no matter where or when they are from.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
It is no exaggeration to call this festival I host famed throughout both Rome and Chaldea!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She started her speech already!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hear, hear!  
   
  
   
**Nero:**   
Umu. Thanks for your cheers. My audience truly knows how to behave the third time around!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
And that makes introductions unnecessary.  
Let's get down to business!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I will leave nitpicking about the definition of a festival to the more cultured Servants.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
My glorious Nero Fest, a festival only possible through the cooperation of Rome and Chaldea!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Now it begins again!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Surely many Heroic Spirits look forward to this martial tournament set in this great Colosseum.  
  
   
**Nero:**   
A festival of power, modeled after the festival of Olympia! Attendees will praise the warriors' courage!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Honed physiques and unparalleled skills in fierce competition! What could be more beautiful, more noble!?  
  
   
**Nero:**   
As people love to admire a blooming rose, so too do they enjoy seeing a human being reach their very limit!  
  
   
**Nero:**   
And that is itself my Rome...the festival of Olympia!  
  
   
**E：Crowd:**   
Rome! Rome! Rome!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Rome!  
   
**Nero:**   
Umu! All of humanity is indeed Rome!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
All hail the Emperor!  
   
**Nero:**   
Hehehe. Your applause is making me blush.  
  
   
  
   
**Nero:**   
But, as emperor, I shall permit it!  
Enjoy this glorious festival!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Hola, ¿cómo estás? I heard that there's going to be Lucha Libre at the Arena México, yes!?  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Hehehe, I cannot wait, no!  
This will be the perfect time to test out my new plancha!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Master, my cute [♂ hermanito /♀ hermanita].  
Why not participate as a [♂ luchadore /♀ luchadora]?  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Haha. Not a bad idea!  
Training Master once in a while wouldn't hurt!  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
...Hey, I'm only kidding.  
Don't look at me like that, Master.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Only those who truly WANT to slug it out should participate. Like me or this tall lady here.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Hnnn, no, no. You make it sound so barbaric, yes.  
Lucha is a clash of honed out skills.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Ah, you got me there. Well, you know, there's all kindsa ways to say the same thing.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
There are some punches used in Lucha Libre, right? They call it, uh, “golpe,” or “patada,” or something?  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Besides, this is all between Servants!  
Even if I really cut loose, nothing bad would happen!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
...Ay yi yi.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
You have yet to understand the true essence of Lucha.  
I shall demonstrate it for you myself, yes!    
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
It's finally time for the long-awaited Servant Lucha Libre tournament. The sacred site for Lucha, the Arena México, has been rented out.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
This is the perfect chance to spread the wonderful word of Lucha to everyone!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Lucha, eh? From what I hear, the flow of the match is predetermined, and the proper protocol is to take whatever move comes head on.  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Truly it would take a steely spirit that relies on sheer trust of your opponent. Uh, but you know, Quetzalcoatl...  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
If you have the battle go by your own bare-knuckle rules, none of the Good-aligned Heroic Spirits would be a match against you.  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Besides, this isn't a Lucha tournament,  
and this isn't the Arena México.  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
And...the Colosseum is not in Mexico City.  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Qué!?!?!?  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Lalalala! Not listening!  
Fergus, you meanie, yes!  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
You bastard! I was just going along with what the goddess was saying, then you sweep in to ruin it all! You're spoiling all the fun!  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
We're gonna end up slugging it out with our bare hands anyway, so might as well call it Lucha, jackass!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
You say that... And I suppose it is only right for a warrior to answer the call of Lucha.  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Lamentably, I am no more than an amateur when it comes to Lucha. The only finishing hold I know is Tirabuzón.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Tirabuzón, the Cobra Twist!?  
Old man, you're totally a Lucha enthusiast!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Hahaha!!!  
Miss Quetzal has challenged me a few times already!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Many times, in truth!  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Oh come now, tell the truth. When you say she's challenged you, what you really mean is that you practiced Lucha in the simulator.  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Ah yes. In the simulator room with nobody around at night...a Lucha Libre in the dark!  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Shut up!  
  
   
**Fergus:**   
Three matches in just one hour!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
Ah-ha! I knew it, yes! I hear true Lucha matches do happen mostly at night, yes!  
  
   
**Quetzalcoatl:**   
So during the day...the Roman Pankration! And at night...a carnival of Lucha where the air is filled with bulging muscles flying about!  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Uh, that's not what I meant...  
Damn, you're just making things even worse, old man!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuuurrrr...  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Try...best...  
(Makes fist)  
  
   
**Babbage:**   
Wonderful, my dear! What intensity you have. Your passion and heat are like a steam engine on the verge of critical pressure.  
  
   
**Babbage:**   
And so I have no choice but to aid you in your efforts. That's right...consider it a continuation of the dream we both shared this summer.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Hmmm, it would seem you've beaten me to the punch.  
I do, however, share your sentiments, Babbage.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
My lovely daughter is so very excited. As her papa, I could do no less than to aid her in her quest for victory with all my strength!  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Yes...that is the duty of a proper papa!  
  
   
**Fran:**   
(Stare)  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Nnnngh... Nnnnnggghhh...  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
...Yes, of course, my lovely daughter.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
I shall, using every conceivable means, with every imaginable trap, employing every possible act of villainy, dispose of all your competition!  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
I had meant to relax awhile, but perhaps this is a good time to truly apply myself.  
  
   
**Fran:**   
Uuuuuurrr!  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Ah, yes, quite right. No cheating, of course! As such, papa will fire his magical bullets from the front line!  
  
   
**Babbage:**   
Steam power at full throttle, steam power at full throttle. We shall aid the daughter of Victor on her path to glorious and dazzling victory!  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...C'mon. You call yourself an Assassin?  
Shouldn't you be good at spying and scouting?  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Why is finding some missing people taking so long!? You should be able to pick out which ones are NPCs and which ones are Servants!  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
S-sorry.  
I...actually don't have skills for that sort of thing...  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
The best I can do is to conceal myself within a crowd.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
You lack PRESENCE!  
Just hurry up and find Fran, you shut-in.  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I've got this sinking feeling&ndash;err, well actually,  
I have a feeling something exciting's about to happen.  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Yes, yes.  Strange. She was with me just a minute ago.  
  
   
**Berserker of El Dorado:**   
...There's some kind of commotion.  
  
   
**Berserker of El Dorado:**   
I heard something regarding a festival of combat prowess, but that it was intended solely for amusement. I see no point in participating in such a thing.  
  
   
**Berserker of El Dorado:**   
What point or purpose is there in such restraint?  
What I yearn for is true and earnest combat.  
  
   
**Berserker of El Dorado:**   
That is all.  
There was no purpose in summoning me here, Caligula.  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
I do not...wish...for bloodshed...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Nor...do I desire...battle...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Only...Nero...my love and hope...for her sake...I shall...  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
GATHER MEDALS!!!  
  
   
**Berserker of El Dorado:**   
M-medals!? What!?  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Ooohhhhhhhhh!!!  
  
   
**Berserker of El Dorado:**   
Wh-what is the meaning of this!?  
Calm yourself, Emperor Caligula!  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
MEDALS...WANT!!!  
  
   
**Berserker of El Dorado:**   
...!!!  
  
   
**Berserker of El Dorado:**   
...I see. So that is it.  
  
   
**Berserker of El Dorado:**   
While I remain uninterested in trivial diversions, the fact remains that I manifested in Chaldea as a Berserker, like you.  
  
   
**Berserker of El Dorado:**   
I also harbor a flame that I cannot seem to extinguish. Yes...it burns within me...  
  
   
**Berserker of El Dorado:**   
Fine, Caligula.  
Then I shall aid you temporarily!  
  
   
**Caligula:**   
Oooooooooooohhhhhh!!!  
  
   
**Berserker of El Dorado:**   
Your fearsome temperament has impressed me.  
You may yet keep up with my strength!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Hmmmm. Two Berserkers interacting with each other... Makin' me kinda jelly.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
A tournament with the silver-haired sporty-spice Berserker! The ferocious lion within me...okay, well, maybe it's not a lion...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Maybe a killer whale or a shark.  
Well, let's just say a carnivore is about to awaken!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
That physique, glistening with sweat from battle! And that iron ball that looks like a sea urchin! Hrnnngh! I'd definitely be a goner if that hits me!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...So. You're okay with what happened?  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Well, there's no point in this old man intervening.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
She said she wasn't interested in “trivial diversions.” And yet she's getting all fired up for this event. Things are just getting more complicated, is all.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
It's not as if we are strangers, and I would recommend that she calm down. But then again...  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
She's really not the type to listen to anyone past a certain point. I just pray no one does anything stupid.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I see. Does that mean you'll be with me to...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...Watch the tournament. Carefully record it. Admire the beauties who move so beautifully around the tournament stage...  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
The only thing we agree on is that we both hope to get through this event without having to fight, Captain. Of course, if a storm is brewing, it won't matter whether we're audience members or not.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I like playing outside, but hitting each other isn't a good game for girls.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Playing tag or hide-and-go-seek would have been better. Oh, this event is more for boys.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
You think so?  
We like dismembering!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
But if you don't like it, Nursery, then we don't either.  
It's not fun if we can't play together.  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Teehee. Thank you.  
Do you agree too, Ibaraki-Douji?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Um...unnngh. W-well, normally I reeeally try to enjoy smashing, tearing, and pillaging as an oni should...  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
But I'm with Jack on this one. If Nursery Rhyme doesn't like it, then I won't force it on you.  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
So what should we play?  
House is fun, so is ball...but I want some excitement...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I know.  
Let's ask the other kid!  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Other kid?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Hm? Who's that?  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
Could it be!?  
  
   
**Assassin of the Nightless City:**   
...Kuhaha. I didn't expect you to see through my Presence Concealment! You guys are good!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I don't think you tried too hard to hide.  
I kept seeing your pretty dress flapping.  
  
   
**Assassin of the Nightless City:**   
Indeed. My overwhelming beauty just cannot be hidden!  
You are a wise Caster, you know that?  
  
   
**Assassin of the Nightless City:**   
I shall praise you.  
And you shall be rewarded.  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Wow, a reward? What is it?  
  
   
**Assassin of the Nightless City:**   
My prized torture device! It's a cute fruit-shaped torturing tool! I just so happen to have three or four of them lying around, so you can have one!  
  
   
**Ibaraki-Douji:**   
G-giving a torture device as a reward is...a little weird...and it's shaped like fruit...fruit...?  
  
   
**Jack:**   
Uh, we might have SOME interest in it. Maybe.  
Is it cute?  
  
   
**Assassin of the Nightless City:**   
Of course it is!  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I do love a good scary story, but being given a tool for torture is...well, you know...  
  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...It makes me feel a little like...a dragon...you know?  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Ah-choo!  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Oh my. Hehehe. The children are all running about the halls so energetically.  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Seeing them like this brings back memories of my own little Kintoki when he was young...  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Oh yes. And I can only imagine Master was a cute little child too. Heehee.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
It sounded as if those children were talking about torture or something... Well, I suppose I can let that slide.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
I'm just glad to see children so happy.  
Children...children...  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
There seems to have been quite the increase in the number of children around here. Well not exactly, since they're actually Servants...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Yeah. Maybe it's time we thought of adding kids' meals to the menu...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
We do have something like that for young Servants who can't eat full portions, but that's not much fun.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
A dish beloved by many, yet both popular and easy to eat... I've been avoiding it this whole time because it's so easy...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
But maybe it's time to offer the forbidden mild-flavored curry?  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
I like it!  
Good idea!  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
...But we're going to be slammed during Nero Fest. Do we really have the time to be adding new dishes to the menu right now?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Besides, we have more Servants to help in the kitchen now.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Say no more.  
When you think of curry, you think...hurry for curry!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Which means, we need someone who's speedy in the kitchen! This cat knows just the one to fit that bill!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
A man who's only effective when the sun is in the sky!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
That would be Sir Gawain! He's sure to cook up a great pot of curry real fast, since he's only got so much time to work with!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Yeah, but let's not invite Lip over. We wouldn't want Sir Gawain to be distracted and stop his work, now would we?  
  
   
**Minamoto-no-Raikou:**   
Heh. Oh my. So he is only powerful when the sun is out? What a wonderful trait.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
You really...think so?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
...What? I do not want to hear of this, even from you.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
I have no wish to involve myself in such trivialities. To think you would come to visit me, only to babble about the Roman Emperor's absurd festival.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
I always thought of you as a brave man who might be frivolous even on the battlefield, but this is something else entirely.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Begone, Archer.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Oh? That's an unexpected response from you, Pharaoh.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
You don't like festivals? I thought you were the type of king who didn't mind your citizens having fun.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Of course not. I do not care what the citizens do for  pleasure. The whole universe is within my grasp! I am a tolerant pharaoh, you know!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
But listen. I and I alone decide what I do. The very thought of the great pharaoh participating in an ancient Roman festival is laughable!  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Maybe so, but why don't you think it over?  
Think of it as a breath from our hectic lives...  
  
   
**Arash:**   
But it wouldn't be bad to go and test your strength either. Think about it: we're in Chaldea, where all sorts of Heroic Spirits gather from around the world.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Your participation would make this festival even more exciting.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
...Hmph. You are a smooth talker.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Besides.  
I think it's about time you met the other guy.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
When you two meet, it should be on an appropriate stage where Servants can safely fight. A battle between you&ndash;the Sun King&ndash;and him would be much too dangerous to take place in Chaldea itself.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Hm?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
No, nothing...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
(I-is that...)  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
(Could that be Pharaoh Ozymandias!?  
So he is finally attending the ancient Roman festival!)  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
(I-I cannot stand idly by! Should the Pharaoh be on the move, Nitocris must also take action!)  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Nitocris.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Yes! Pharaoh Ozymandias!  
What is your order!?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
I have warmed to the idea of going.  
I trust you to hold the fort while I'm away.  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
...Eh? Uh...um...well, I...!  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Hahaha. Leave the guarding to the Sphinx. It's no fun for her to stay behind during a festival. Don't you agree, big bro pharaoh?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Heh. Indeed.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
We will go together then, Nitocris!  
Ready yourself!  
  
   
**Nitocris:**   
Yes!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Mr. Hijikata? Hijikata? How much longer do you plan on sitting there munching pickles?  
  
   
**Okita:**   
The event's starting. The event!  
I know it's not a super giant one, but...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
But with all the Servants who're participating,  
this might actually turn into a big deal!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
This is one of the best opportunities to demonstrate Tennen Rishinryu&ndash;err, the Shinsengumi, that we'll ever get!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
This is also our chance to get ahead of Nobbu!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Come on now! I know you like things like this,  
Mister Hijikata!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...Well, okay, so you may not measure up to me when it comes to official matches...  
  
   
**Okita:**   
But you have your eye-blinding, sand throwing, anything goes killer “Baragaki” technique.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Using your ultimate Tennen Rishinryu spirit that the audience would sure to be judgmental of, let's show who's boss!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Quit your yapping.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Awww.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Well, I couldn't say much for other events like races, but I suppose a festival like this is a different matter.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
I like the idea of fighting these other folks to the death.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
...Um, killing isn't allowed.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Hey, wait a minute. Mr. Hijikata? I thought you were munching on pickles because you weren't interested?  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
...Don't get the wrong idea. I was just filling up so I wouldn't be fighting on an empty stomach.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Let's go, Okita.  
  
   
**Okita:**   
That's the spirit!  
  
   
**Okita:**   
Ah, brings back memories of our training hall days.  
I'll get a few great Okita victories under my belt!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Talk big when you win, Okita.  
You're embarrassing yourself. Okay.  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Shinsengumi, move out!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...Yo, hold it right there, Miss Dark Saber.  
  
   
**Altria Alter:**   
What?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Aren't you that alternative Servant of the King of Knights of the Round Table?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Yet you're different than usual. I sense a tenseness...a tingling sensation from you. You're so revved up, it's electrifying.  
  
   
**Altria Alter:**   
What is your point?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Okay. Let me get straight to the point, straight as the cutting edge of a blade!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
You're a Rider, right? That means you got some kinda mount or machine, yeah?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I saw ya race a while back, but that was that red'n'gold emperor's ride, right?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Bumpin' into you must be fate!  
Would ya mind showing me your darkness machine!?  
  
   
**Altria Alter:**   
...  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Fufu. Show a bit of mercy if he's bothering you.  
This little brat was itching to join the race.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
But NOBODY asked him to participate.  
He was so dejected, he's acting all funny.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Boys are such strange creatures.  
So keep that in mind and don't get too angry, okay?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Wh-what!? What the hell!? When did you show up!?  
And you're wrong! No! Absolutely not! No, no, no!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I ain't dejected or actin' weird, okay!?  
Quit makin' up stuff about me!  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Fine, fine. Look at those pouty lips.  
You're just like a child.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Want a piece of candy?  
Or maybe a soft dumpling that's easier to chew?  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
HEY! Quit treatin' me like a kid!  
  
   
**Altria Alter:**   
...I see now. If he is no more than a child,  
there's no need for me to raise my mop over this.  
  
   
**Altria Alter:**   
Sakata Kintoki. If you seek a place to direct your pent-up youthful energy...  
  
   
**Altria Alter:**   
I suggest you participate in the tournament that Emperor Nero is holding. I'm sure a handful of hot-blooded folks have gathered again this year.  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Hey, I ain't&ndash;  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Yes, yes. Be a good boy and stop bothering this nice lady. Now, let's go to the festival.  
  
   
**Shuten-Douji:**   
Oh yes. Fufufufu. If you behave yourself,  
maybe I'll buy you a candy apple...  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I said NO THANK YOU!  
Geddit through your head!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Hnnnn! This is going to be my year!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
I, Xuanzang Sanzang, will win for sure this year! A whole buncha stuff happened last year that prevented me from winning!  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
So...Touta!  
I choose you to accompany me!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Wait a minute. You've got it all wrong.  
Think back on what happened last year.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
It's true this is a competition for Servants to test their strength, but this tournament's different. It's not about finding a single victor.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
It's neither an elimination competition nor is it a round robin battle. They're just one-off battles on a grand stage, each for a brief moment.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Besides, you're a monk.  
A great monk at that.  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
Getting enthusiastic over brawls wouldn't be right. I'm just saying you should probably focus on hitting the wooden drum Mokugyo.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Oh, that hollow-sounding thing! Nice!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
...That's your reaction?  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
Well, yeah. It's not that everyone's fighting to kill. Everyone's participating to better themselves, as a part of training.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
They're not focused on winning.  
But since it's for training, we should go beyond all out!  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
I guess...you could think of it that way.  
  
   
**Sanzang:**   
And so! This year for sure!  
I will! Positively! Win! (Grin)  
  
   
**Tawara Touta:**   
(Hmmm. So this is what desire looks like... Now then. At this rate, I wonder when will the great Monk Sanzang actually reach enlightenment...?)  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
No assaults in the night, no assassination, and no surprise attacks, huh? And on top of that...  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
No killing. What a buzzkill.  
This event really will be hard on us Assassins.  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Hahahaha. Then the only thing you can do is REBEL. Wonderful! All forms of treachery will be permitted!  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Ah, Rome! Ah, the emperor! Truly a vain embodiment of a multitude of tyrannies and oppression, all in one place!  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Oh hey, Spartacus.  
You get my drift.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
What do you think? Want to try running amok without restraint one time? Surely you're tired of living in Chaldea with a bunch of emperors and kings all around.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
If you're in it, then I will...  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Hahahaha! Indeed! We have the right to rebel against all these tyrannies, smash down insolence, while the pride of the mighty is crushed!  
  
   
**Spartacus:**   
And at the same time, we shall use this opportunity to clear the air of our pent-up grudge! We have the right to such joy at this festival!  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Hmph. I get it now.  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
This may be an event run by an authority, but you will allow such a thing to be run as long as there are people who enjoy such event. Am I correct?  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
You seem more calm and levelheaded than I am,  
Spartacus, the forever rebellious one.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Oh, it's you, Master.  
Go away.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Ah, an expression of opinion similar to one oft expressed! I regret to say this myself, Master, but I am of the same opinion as he.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Getting right to the point in a story is important, and he is the right man for the job. What he means is: anything mightier than the pen is positively brutish!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
That is to say, we are unfit to participate in this particular event.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
A recreation of the festival of Olympia? An elegant and beautiful show of battles in the Colosseum?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
No.  
Wrong.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
This tournament is quite clearly an event for the physically fit. The question, though, is one of what is being promoted here.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
It's simply a shot in the arm made to entertain the readers&ndash;I mean, the citizens.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Nothing more. Nothing less. I must regretfully inform you that we are not needed here.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Seriously? I thought this was a festival glorifying me! What a surprise! I didn't think THAT was its purpose!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Well, I do not recall permitting such festivities, as they have nothing to do with pharaohs...so I did have a sneaking suspicion...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Either way, it is a good thing for a nation to thrive!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I am sure the economic effects are great.  
If proper measures were put in place beforehand, that is.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I wonder if Her Imperial Majesty had that in mind? I wouldn't mind taking a bit of her time to give a presentation...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Go do that on your own time. This study is exclusively for the writer-Servants of Chaldea.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Oh come now, don't say such a thing. I'd rather not simply confine myself to the same perpetually glum faces, ever harassed by deadlines...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
This beaming pharaoh's presence certainly brightens up our space, after all. The light of her divine beauty...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Ah, what better inspiration to get our creative juices flowing!? As you can already see, my creative motivation is on the rise!  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Why thank you, Shakespeare. But I am afraid you are somewhat lacking in muscle. You really must take better care of yourself.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
You certainly do favor married women...  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
No, no, no! Nothing like that! And to prove it...I have the perfect individual to back me up!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Well, he IS here,  
but...well, as long as you're all right with it...  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Hm? It appears study room A is a bit rowdy.  
Do you suppose Master stopped by?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Well, no matter.  
It is just the two of us in study room B, after all.  
  
   
**Caster of the Nightless City:**   
...  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Beautiful. You truly are beautiful. You may be concealing that beauty with a veil, but I can tell.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
You are an exquisite beauty who shines not by the sun's light, but a beauty who whose luminance is best viewed at night, by starlight.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Yet as a fellow Servant, I'm sure you have considerable power on the battlefield.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
You show no sign of that, though.  
Beautiful as you are, you are surely dangerous as well.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
And that is what truly intrigues me.  
  
   
**Caster of the Nightless City:**   
...Please stop, Lord Caesar.  
  
   
**Caster of the Nightless City:**   
I am a Caster. Just a simple Caster. I am merely one of many Servants who has formed a contract with Master.  
  
   
**Caster of the Nightless City:**   
You may try to woo me with honeyed words,  
but I dare not answer them.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Say no such thing.  
You can trust me.  
  
   
**Caster of the Nightless City:**   
...  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I am an able man.  
Let me prove that much to you.  
  
   
**Caster of the Nightless City:**   
You mustn't...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Lord CAAAEEESAAAR!?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Wha...!?  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
You have apologized and begged my forgiveness countless times...and STILL you... Who exactly is that...woman...!?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I...well...  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Oh.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Do not “oh” me, Caesar. It seems your heart is as clogged with junk as your belly.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
It just so happens that a martial tournament is about to begin. So I have a wonderful idea.  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I will have you, Lord Caesar, participate and ask a bunch of Sabers to help you slim down.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I...well...I don't...  
  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Yes?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
...Uh... Yes ma'am.  
That might...not such a bad idea.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
(...Oh, my Caesarion. What shall I do?  
What do you think I should do?)  
  
   
**E：Voice of Caesarion:**   
(It would help if you slimmed down a bit.)  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Mentor, Mentor!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I just heard! There's going to be a tournamament to test the strength of all Chaldea's Servants!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
...Um. This tournamament isn't going to require that Santas partici...um, join, right?  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Not strictly speaking, no.  
But since it is such a grand event...  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
It would be a shame to simply ignore it.  
First of all, let's think about seasons.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Seasons?  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Yes. Seasons change from summer to fall, fall to winter.  
I hear that fall is quite short.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
But I digress a bit. Anyway, it would be best to take time to train in the seasons prior to winter...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Oh I see! So if I train well during this tournament, I would become a great Santa by the time winter comes! How logimical!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
The word is logical, and it isn't!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
It's obviously a super sporty event!  
And Amakusa, stop talking nonsense!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Oh, hello, grown-up me. Please do not shout in the halls. You will bother the other Servants and staff.  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
And playing the role of Santa is a tough job. It requires a good, strong body, too, you know. Yes, it does. Argument won!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Don't give me that sh&ndash;crap!  
And stop saying “argument won!”  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
Calm down, me. She's like our little sister.  
Make sure to treat her better than that, okay?  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Ah, yes.  
You and I are surprisingly on the same page.  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
...Even that may happen once in a while...  
  
   
**Jeanne d'Arc:**   
Right, Alter?  
As an older sister, you should&ndash;  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
HELL!!! NO!!!  
  
   
**Count of Monte Cristo:**   
...  
  
   
**Count of Monte Cristo:**   
...Heh.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Don't lurk in a corner like that.  
Why don't you come out and talk with the others?  
  
   
**Count of Monte Cristo:**   
...My queen.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
See? Everyone seems to be having fun.  
Those good friends are talking with other like family.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
So many Jeanne d'Arcs. Their existences and relationships are quite mysterious and...  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Wonderful.  
Don't you agree, Count?  
  
   
**Count of Monte Cristo:**   
My Queen. I'm afraid I have just happened to pass by.  
  
   
**Count of Monte Cristo:**   
I have nothing to add to that scene. I have no strong feelings. Same goes with what I think. You might as well ask your general.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh. You think so?  
  
   
**Count of Monte Cristo:**   
I do.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh...he disappeared.  
Did he dematerialize?  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Hm. So he fled. With just a few more minutes, and I would have been able to treat his mental state.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Oh, hello, Nurse.  
What's going on?  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Nothing. I have been attempting to treat that man for some time now, but he flees every time. He is not aware that he is injured.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
Hehehe. Give him a rest.  
It's not nice to pester him so much.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
No. It is, I assure you, a part of the treatment.  
  
   
**Marie:**   
I see. Then if d'Eon or Amadeus goes overboard during this festival, please treat them, okay?  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Of course.  
You need not worry about that, Marie Antoinette.  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Whenever an event or battle should arise, I will never hesitate to treat the wounded, regardless of what it may be that ails them.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Wasteful.  
So terribly wasteful.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
The event itself is not the problem. A break is good for morale. No one can remain sane constantly staring down the jaws of death itself.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
But! This may be a simulator, but a waste is a waste!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
The device operates on Chaldea's system, too!  
Using it thoughtlessly is wasteful!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Besides, what benefit is there to training so many Servants? If you want to train someone, train me! Me!  
  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Hmmm...the king of Uruk is surprisingly miserly.  
  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
I thought he was a king of luxury like me...who would spend extravagantly without a second thought...  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fool. I'm not stingy, but I am also a man who saves up! Listen well: one should only spend extravagantly after making a fortune!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
But look at Chaldea! Its power always runs at capacity, and its employees' wages are never raised!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Basic salary should always be increased every year,  
the fools!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
I'm not saying that you need to be considerate of the older workers. I'm only saying that one should be compensated according to their skills!  
  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Hm. That is sound advice. I'll keep it in mind.  
But being so stodgy and all-business is such a drear way to live.  
  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
The more glorious the festival, the better.  
Don't you agree?  
  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
I understand your perspective, of course, but a simulator exists to be used, doesn't it?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Then just bear in mind the sheer amount of data that will create. The thing that's called...Sheba?  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
If that thing's running at full capacity, day and night,  
Da Vinci is sure to get frustrated. The first part of the festival should be run modestly.  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
After all, the preliminaries are mere battles between those up until four stars. It shouldn't concern a five star Servant like me!  
  
   
**Gilgamesh:**   
Fwahahahahahahahaha!  
  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Fuwahahahahahahahaha!  
I'm just laughing along with you!  
  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Ah, that's the king Gilgamesh I've heard of! The arrogant but mischievous sort that you just can't hate for some reason!  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
...Ah, the one who walks the never-ending path.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
You are now in Chaldea, a place where numberless destinies intersect. Yet I notice that you purposefully avoid interacting with others.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
A foolish choice.  
Humans cannot live or act in isolation.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
So too with Rome.  
You must reflect and look back on your own path.  
  
   
**Arthur:**   
...My apologies.  
  
   
**Arthur:**   
Holy Progenitor, Romulus.  
I am not Rome.  
  
   
**Arthur:**   
Still, I shall keep those words of yours in my heart.  
But remember, I once fought against Rome itself.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
No, you are Rome.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
You are human, therefore you are Rome.  
Make no mistake: Rome and love reside within all people.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Enjoy yourself. Even should you keep your face concealed, none will judge you.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
My Rome is the source of many joyous festivals.  
Do not forget, my child. People cannot live without joy.  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
In other words...  
  
   
**Romulus:**   
Enjoy! Smile!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Okay, here we go!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
...Mahatma Change!  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Our summer vacation has been extended! Hot places are still hot, so there's no reason not to let loose!  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
I see. This is not bad at all. However, I believe I shall join the authors to escape the summer heat.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
What are you talking about? You can't. You need to be out in the sun and move that body of yours sometimes.  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Contrary to what you say, you're well-versed in such activities, aren't you, Master of Baritsu?  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
Only in times of emergency.  
Besides, my Baritsu is intended for self defense&ndash;  
  
   
**Helena:**   
No more excuses!  
Come on, hurry to the Colosseum! Get to it!  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
...Seriously?  
  
   
**Helena:**   
Yes, of course.  
You and I both are going on a mad dash!  
  
   
**A：Mash:**   
Ah, so many...  
  
   
**A：Mash:**   
All the Servants with dauntless courage have assembled in Chaldea... Everyone seems very excited.  
  
   
**A：Mash:**   
This festival shall be of some use and serve you well for the future.  
  
   
**A：Mash:**   
I am...also excited.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's work hard to collect medals!  
   
**A：Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai, my Master.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Huh?　Ma...sh...?  
   
**A：Mash:**   
Yes. It's me, Mash.  
Don't worry, Senpai, my Master.  
  
   
  
   
**A：Mash:**   
...I...will try...my best...  
  
   
## Return of Nero Fest - Autumn 2019 (Second Half)  
   
**Narration:**   
...I have come to the conclusion...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
During the Emperor's festival,  
where all Heroes of Chaldea assemble...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
A brief moment of pleasure and respite in the fight to save humanity...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Surely it is a very noble event. Battles to fulfill the purest of all competitive desires without profit or gain...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
The stress of our daily lives, the exhaustion of so many battles eased, if only for a moment.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
It's a wonderful thing. A festival is necessary.  
Yes. I do understand that this event is important.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
But...that is why I have come to my own conclusion...  
I also want to fulfill my efforts...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
My powers have diminished compared to what they were during my lifetime, but I still want to be of some use to you.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
I do not want to impede the path you take. I just want to be of help. Be your strength. I want to serve my purpose.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
That's why...I want to...  
  
   
**A：Mash:**   
I can't stop this anymore...can't stop this feeling.  
  
   
**A：Mash:**   
I am a warrior of the Valkyries,  
created by the great god Odin.  
  
   
**A：Mash:**   
I once served the gods...was no more than an automaton. Soon I met my love, Sigurd, and perished as a woman.  
  
   
**A：Mash:**   
I am the Heroic Spirit Brynhild. I sit in the Throne,  
but have lost all my Authority as a god.  
  
   
**A：Mash:**   
My sealed powers...many functions equivalent to Authority are awakening. I want them to. They're beginning to work. I want them to work.  
  
   
**A：Mash:**   
Because...tonight, all the conditions will be met.  
  
   
**A：Mash:**   
Many Heroes and great men participating in battle.  
So many warriors I am compelled to love.  
  
   
**A：Mash:**   
But...yes, yes... I must choose.  
Watching all these heroes do battle...  
  
   
**A：Mash:**   
The time has come to select the most valiant of all heroes.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...Though not much blood will be spilled...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
It will be all right. I will claim no souls. Valhalla, built for my father, the great god, is far from here.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Even with much of my power and functions sealed, such things are nothing if I use a Primordial Rune.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
If I make even the slightest error in my calculations,  
I may lose my Spirit Origin...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...But I don't mind.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Before I disappear, I will fulfill my purpose...all that is asked of me.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
For you, I shall train the selected Servant and construct them anew.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
O...kay.  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Yes.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
I shall do it without Nótt,  
the goddess of night, detecting me.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wait...Mash...I mean, you're...  
   
**Brynhild:**   
It is fine.  
It will be fine.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
There is nothing to worry about.  
Please leave everything to me, Senpai, my Master.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
So please don't give me that sad look.  
  
   
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Altering Heroic Spirits.  
A pseudo-Palingenesis without a Holy Grail.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So that's what she meant.  
Now I understand.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The single most valiant Servant in Chaldea is selected, and a perpetual enhancement is applied by using the Primordial Rune...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That is likely her intent...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is exactly what Scáthach and El-Melloi mentioned!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash!?  
   
**A：Mash:**   
Senpai, my Master.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, that's Brynhild!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm the real Mash Kyrielight. You are a true Heroic Spirit...a Valkyrie from Norse mythology!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Two...Mashes!?  
   
**A：Mash:**   
Senpai, my Master.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, that's Brynhild!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm the real Mash Kyrielight. You are a true Heroic Spirit...a Valkyrie from Norse mythology!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And yet Senpai is confusing the two of us. It must be because of the Runes. Am I correct, Brynhild?  
  
   
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We can avoid disaster if you just stop now.  
Well...the only thing that's really gone wrong so far is...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Nero, who figured something was going on, started to pout because her tournament was essentially used as a tool...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But if you stop now, I'm sure she'll just laugh and forgive you. After all, nothing has happened yet.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please, Brynhild.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...You really are a gentle child, Mash.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Yes. You are indeed fit to be alongside Master. While you may not be overflowing with courage, you are full of determination.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
You certainly could be a Valkyrie of this modern era.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
But I'm sorry.  
Truly sorry.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
I've already begun to fulfill my purpose! Hero selection! Spirit Origin strengthening! Pseudo-Palingenesis!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Brynhild!  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
I can't stop it!  
It won't stop!  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
From here on, Chaldea's mightiest Heroic Spirit must be found to defeat me! My purpose is to modify, build, and strive for divine creation!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But such a feat is impossible to fulfill as a Heroic Spirit! Scáthach and El-Melloi said so!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Surely you understand this, too!  
So that's why you kept saying you may disappear...  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Words will not reach her.  
She's quite stubborn, you know.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What...!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That voice!  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I am afraid you need to beat it into her.  
I recall a similar situation in the past.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
Put a swift end to it and resume the tournament.  
After all, stadium food is good civilization.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Altera!  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I was wondering why I couldn't hear the incessant voice longing for Sigurd during the tournament.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I never imagined you were so consumed by this, Brynhild.  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I apologize. I didn't realize your dilemma.  
But I will not neglect your cries anymore.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Siegfried!  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
It is, of course, not only those two who have gotten involved, Mash.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
As I was the one who put some of these ideas in your head, it would be wrong of me to sit back and watch.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
I knew something was strange!  
I thought Mash was less shield-y than usual.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Rather, I suspected she was more lance-y...and it turned out to be true!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Because a shield + lance = me, Leonidas! Which means, according to my calculations, you are not Miss Mash!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Leonidas! Scáthach!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
And it's not just us! All the Servants who sensed Miss Brynhild's unusual behavior have come!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
We have assembled here!  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Well, it's a bit embarrassing to be introduced like that. The truth is that we just sensed something hinky.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Um...I believe you sensed it better than that. You looked really worried... You looked almost like a pervert looking at prey.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I'm no pervert. Stalker at WORST!  
Besides, how would you know what I was thinking?  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
Eh...? Well the moment you looked at Mash,  
you were oddly irritated and grumpy...  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
You already have shifty eyes to begin with, but then you got even more awkward...and I was like “ack.”  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
(Irritated) Listen, you: I do not have shifty eyes.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Chaldea is kind of like a campsite. It's only natural to monitor the health and wellness of everyone here.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Who's not feeling good...who's acting strange...who's talking weird. Stuff like that.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I'm well versed in scouting. I'd never miss any signs of anything or anyone about to go off an betray us.  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I see... But the fact remains that you look creepy when you're staring at everyone around the cafeteria.  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That's not the point. Were you even listening!? I think all the blood that should be in your brain ended up going to your breasts!  
  
   
**Passionlip:**   
I-it did not! And please stop scolding and punishing me like a know-it-all!  
  
   
**Suzuka Gozen:**   
Oh, man, that is just, like, MEGA cringe.  
How 'bout you downvote that creeper style. For real.  
  
   
**Suzuka Gozen:**   
So this is the real Greenie? Super skeevy? Is he, like, out for the shrine maiden fox's number one spot?  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Like hell! I'm a hunter! That fox and I are rivals when it comes to who hunts and who gets hunted.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Now, now, Lady Suzuka. The punishment in this case would be about muscle. There's no doubt he's talking about training one's muscles.  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
There is no difference in the muscles of men and women! Therefore, there is nothing to cringe about!  
  
   
**Suzuka Gozen:**   
Seriously? Is that what Chaldea's like?  
Chaldea's all about that dudebro life, then?  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
No, we are a group of intellectuals who prize careful calculation!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
But I can see that Lady Passionlip, Lady Suzuka, and Sir Robin get along well. Did you all fight alongside each other at some point?  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Anyway, Lady Mash and Fujimaru!  
The French contingent has come as well!  
  
   
**Gilles:**   
If the holy maiden commands me, then I shall not waver. I had no idea that a Valkyrie of Northern Europe had concealed herself within this festival.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
I'd like for this to end peacefully.  
If you stop now, it will be as if nothing happened.  
  
   
**d'Eon:**   
Let us have some tea instead.  
This message I bring from the queen herself, Brynhild.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
There are still more warriors here to support you! Behold!  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Hey! We're here too! Come on, teacher!  
Don't lag behind! Come to the front!  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
...Why would you put a Caster on the front line?  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Ah, now I see. Brynhild of Northern Europe.  
Even if you do really possess a true Primordial Rune...  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
It would be best not to use its full strength here. Those runes hold the power of the great god of the Norse, Odin.  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Worst case scenario, not only will your Spirit Origin be destroyed, you may create an anomaly that spreads through all of Chaldea.  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Should that happen, even Master would not survive. For example, there may be a flux in magical energy through magical circuits...  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
And phenomena that are otherwise impossible may occur within the space taken over by a Primordial Rune.  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
But...why?  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
You do not appear to be quite so mad...  
  
   
**Kid Gil:**   
Teacher, you're talking too much!  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
I do not recall accepting you as my pupil. What a peculiar twist of fate, considering who you become.  
  
   
**Alexander:**   
Oh don't be so mean, teacher.  
Gil came by because he is genuinely concerned.  
  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Gil... Unbelievable...  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Ah, this display is almost like a teacher with his students on a school trip. It certainly lightens the mood here!  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
So there you have it, Lady Brynhild!  
You may be a demigod...  
  
   
**Leonidas:**   
But you must see that you are outnumbered! Out of respect for Lady Mash's shield and everyone's concern, why don't you put down your lance?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...  
  
   
**Altera:**   
The king gifted with brilliance is correct, Valkyrie.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
According to legend, you are seen as my younger sister in a way.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
As I am now, I have no memory of that...but the fact remains that we are somehow related.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I cannot have you destroyed here.  
I have yet to properly speak with you.  
  
   
**Altera:**   
...My sister.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...Lord Attil&ndash;Altera...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
The man so like my Sigurd...  
No, I am restraining my desire for Sigurd...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
I will do what must be done...  
It is as simple as that.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...I also wanted to speak with you.  
But...  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Why can't you? We're at a festival.  
There's no point in holding back.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Use this place to air out dirty laundry or get on good terms with each other.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
I don't think it's a bad idea. This old man thinks you should just talk when you have the chance.  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Well, if you can't, that's fine too.  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Argh! Dammit! That's annoying! Doesn't matter what is...you just gotta solve it with your fist!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
That's just shortsighted, Bear-Wolf Guy!  
  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Getting' rough with girls ain't golden.  
After all, Riders are heroes!  
  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Women and children got nothing to do with it if we're up against Heroic Spirits! And sorry to burst your bubble, but I'm a Berserker!  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
Hmph. At least someone gets it...  
  
   
**Hijikata:**   
If there's no choice but to push through, all you have to do is to stick to your values until the very end!  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
He's right. It's not about being a woman or child.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Such a rule will always apply in places where lives are at stake. Be it Heroic Spirit or human, there's no difference.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Indeed. Though that does not mean it is futile to try to communicate.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahaha!  
Ah, my sides hurt from all this laughing!  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
That woman was crazy enough to point her lance at a God King's grand temple, MY temple! Words won't stop her!  
  
   
**Arash:**   
I suppose. I agree with you there.  
  
   
**Arash:**   
...Oh hey. You're here too, Master. If you're back to your old self, you'd better get serious quick!  
  
   
**Arthur:**   
Yes, I agree.  
  
   
**Arthur:**   
Her lance hasn't grown yet, so she doesn't have the power to wipe us all out in one swing.  
  
   
**Arthur:**   
If the plan is to restrain her, we must be quick.  
And then the rest is up to you, Master.  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
Hm?  
  
   
**Ozymandias:**   
You're a new face, aren't you?  
Wait. Wait a moment. That armor...that voice...that bearing... Could you be...?  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Yeah, yeah. Right now we need to focus on the Valkyrie!  
If we don't stop her soon, we'll be goners!  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Stop this.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You don't need to modify Servants!  
   
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...How troubling.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
I do not know what to say.  
Master, are you saying this has all been unnecessary?  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
When you look at me like that, it is clear that there is no need for me to continue down this egotistical path I have taken.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Yes...behavior so selfish must be stopped immediately, I&ndash;  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...I want to stop...at least I think I want to stop.  
But at the same time...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...I feel I must create the strongest possible Heroic Spirit...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, Brynhild!  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
I'm sorry.  
I'm sorry.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
I...I cannot hold myself back.  
I truly am an unstable Heroic Spirit.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
It...it will happen automatically.  
I will begin to love automatically.  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Magical energy surge!  
Master, her Primordial Rune is activating!  
  
   
**Altera:**   
I leave the commands to you, Master. It seems we have no choice but to settle this with our swords.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Prepare for battle!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's stop her!  
   
  
   
**Altera:**   
Understood, Master!  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...Give me a blade. Show me all your power! The one who ends my life will be given the protection and blessing of Palingenesis!!!  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Warriors! Be chosen!  
Heroes! Stop me!  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Me me me...  
Me me me me me me me me meee!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Brynhild!  
   
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Master...!!!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
...And that's how it went.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Chaldea's Master and [♂ his /♀ her] Servants managed to stop the out-of-control Valkyrie.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Oh, and the Valkyrie is quite safe. Her Spirit Core, too.  
In the end, she did not use a Primordial Rune.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Though this is indeed an interesting case study...  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
It all, luckily, ended well.  
As to what caused her to go berserk in the first place...  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
El-Melloi had some idea, but unfortunately he couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
The important bit is that Chaldea is safe and sound.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
None of its systems, Sheba included,  
went out of control.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
It turned out not to be possible to locate another Holy Grail.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
At any rate, sorry to get your hopes up.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...What are you talking about?  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
If I recall, you mentioned something might happen before this tournament started.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
I had absolutely nothing to do with this.  
I am just relieved everyone is safe.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Let's just leave it at that.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
I was interested in what you were going to do if you obtained a Holy Grail, but... Hahaha. You're a more cunning man than I expected.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Then I shall take my leave.  
You should at least enjoy this festival until its end.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
It's being held so everyone can relax.  
After all, everyone deserves a breather once in a while.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
On the other hand...  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Perhaps a minor bit of wickedness like that is more relaxing to you than anything else.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Hahahaha! I believe I'll have to duck that particular question, young man!  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...Farewell.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
He really is a cunning man. Intriguing.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Now then. I suppose it's punishment time.  
I know you're skulking about, O Great Detective.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
Not running away or hiding is unlike you. Have your habits changed now that you've become a Servant?  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
Either way, you are the culprit.  
You were the one who caused Brynhild to go berserk.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Have you any proof?  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
No physical evidence, obviously.  
I would not expect you to be so careless.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
But of course, I did come across the truth.  
Besides, Lord El-Melloi was the detective today.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
The reasoning via magecraft techniques approach is certainly interesting. But either way...  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
Even if there is no clear-cut evidence, there are always ways to find the culprit.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
While such a thing may be impossible for an ordinary man, it is surely not so for the Great Detective. I trust I needn't elaborate?  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Heh. So what you're trying to say is...  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
I'm busted.  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
(Nod)  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
The only thing that remains unclear is whether you knew her rampage could be stopped at the last minute.  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Hope for tomorrow!

**Holmes:**   
Baritsu!!! (Gentlemanly kick!)  
  
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Ow...it looked like you didn't put your whole weight on it, yet it still stings...! Are you sure that move's not against the rules!?  
  
   
**Holmes:**   
Helena was right. I'm glad I participated in the festival.  
It was good to move about a bit.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Master...I wish to formally apologize.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused.  
I am a terribly unstable Servant...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
But Master. Please know that I will do my utmost not to make trouble for you anymore.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Leonardo da Vinci gave me a gift.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
She used a portion of Chaldea's resources to create a device that will make sure my operational status remains normal.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
It may not be completely flawless,  
but I feel more secure than I did before.  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Should I...act strange...again...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...  
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...Please do not hesitate to break me.  
Until that time comes, I will be your strength.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
I won't break you.

**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's okay. You'll never go berserk again, Brynhild.  
   
  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...Yes, Master.
