## Section 1: Let's Read Books

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hm?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I didn't know so many Servants were bookworms...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fionn:**   
(Reading a book)  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
(Reading a book)  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Oh, pardon me.  
I was so caught up in this book I didn't even see you!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Hm? What sort of masterful writing could cause a man as great as myself to make such a careless mistake?  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Oh, it's nothing, really. Just a book with the simple title of “Fionn mac Cumhaill: Knight of Gold.”  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
I have to say, I never knew reading could be so much fun!  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Not at all, good sir. If anyone should beg pardon here, it is I. I am in the same boat as you, Sir Fionn.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
These days, I spend much more time broadening my mind than I do practicing my sword.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
I, too, never thought I would ever be so engaged with books...  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
...but these neat rows of letters written out on paper are far more engaging than I ever thought possible.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
It has been quite enjoyable,  
going back to basics like this.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
I know exactly what you mean. I don't even need to consult my thum...er, Finegas, to understand where you are coming from.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
We knights are no more than men who have only tales of bravery and valor to our names, after all.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
My beloved wife would be worried sick if she saw me so absorbed in a book, of all things.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
In fact, she would almost certainly suspect me of using it to cover up adultery, or some other distasteful business!  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Not that I would ever do anything of the sort, of course. I trust things are similar in your order as well, Gawain?  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
That they are. At least for me.  
  
   
**Gawain:**   
Say, could I trouble you to lend me that book once you are finished with it, Sir Fionn?  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
By all means. I would be happy to let you read it.  
  
   
**Fionn:**   
Now, what's that you're reading there? ...I see.  
So it's called “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight”...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hmmm.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That explains it...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(Reading a book)  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Aah! Fou?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai! Wh-when did you get here!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm so sorry I didn't notice you sooner!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't worry about it.  
   
**Mash:**   
This is far from the first book I've ever read,  
but I was still so caught up in it!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What're you reading, Mash?  
   
**Mash:**   
The Iliad, Homer's Greek epic.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What were you reading?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, this is the Iliad, Homer's Greek epic.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's about the Trojan War.  
The one Achilles and Hektor fought in.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A lot of the Heroic Spirits here love that book.  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh yes!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The way it's written really makes you feel as if you're right there watching the Greeks and Trojans waging this war on behalf of the Greek gods.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's a tragic story, so full of death...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...but it also has such beautiful depictions of strength and valor on both sides...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry. Once I started reading it,  
I just couldn't put it down.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Didn't a guy named Heinrich Schliemann excavate the ruins of Troy?  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, he did!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Iliad was thought to be entirely fictional for a long time, but thanks to Heinrich Schliemann, an archaeologist from the late nineteenth century, many people now believe this story reflects real historic events.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's a true Mystic, weaving history and mythology together like few other historical works.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Sure seems like a lot of people have caught the reading bug.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, really?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, it looks like they have!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We didn't often see Servants reading,  
but now we seem to have books everywhere.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And there's a very simple explanation for that.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Namely...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...we have a library now!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is it. The underground library.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm told it's a massive new library that just showed up here one day, separate from the one we already have.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It might seem like it takes up a lot of room, but they say it's actually using magecraft to bend the space around it.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
As a result, it fits entirely in the storage area, and doesn't get in the way of the Magical Reactor or other support systems at all.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
First I've heard of this.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
R-really? That's odd. It's not like Da Vinci to leave you out of the loop...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, maybe there's a bug in the email server!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That might be it.  
   
**Mash:**   
I'll make sure to check on it later.  
It could just be a loose cable or something.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Da Vinci's definitely not the type to forget to tell us something important.  
   
**Mash:**   
No, she's not.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Back in Chaldea...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...all of our databases were digitized, and we didn't have much in the way of paper books.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Maybe that's why I got so caught up in these actual books...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't sweat it! Besides, this is your time off!  
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you, Senpai!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You really do like paper books, don't you?  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, I do.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They were very rare back at Chaldea, so...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I understand that there's no meaningful difference between reading a tablet or a book in terms of the information you get.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And yet, it's strange. When I read a paper book...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You can't put it down?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Right. Exactly.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Here we are. This is the underground library's reception desk!  
  
   
**H：Librarian:**   
...Welcome.  
  
   
**H：Librarian:**   
My underground library is home to books old and new, from far and wide.  
  
   
**H：Librarian:**   
It has history books, biographies, mythology, legends, tragedies, comedies, classics, new releases, fairy tales...  
  
   
**H：Librarian:**   
...period pieces, Westerns, lowbrow humor, political drama, occidental, oriental, Middle Ages, contemporary...  
  
   
**H：Librarian:**   
Ancient records, recent best sellers, fiction, nonfiction... As well as maps and field guides.  
  
   
**H：Librarian:**   
Oh, and of course...we also have tales of revenge,  
and stories of romance.  
  
   
**H：Librarian:**   
If there's any book you can't find on our shelves,  
please come straight to me.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We really do have a librarian...  
   
**H：Librarian:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**H：Librarian:**   
Good day, Master of Chaldea.  
I suppose this is our first time meeting, isn't it?  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nice to meet you.  
   
**H：Librarian:**   
It's nice to meet you too, Master of Chaldea.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**H：Librarian:**   
By your leave, I am the librarian of this underground library, and a Caster.  
  
   
**H：Librarian:**   
My True Name is Murasaki Shikibu.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I have been enthralled with letters, words,  
and human emotion since I was a child...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I hope you will be patient with me, as there is still much I do not know about the modern world.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Welcome to Chaldea!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm .  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Murasaki Shikibu was born in Japan during the Heian period, just like Raikou and Kintoki.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think...she was an author, right?  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes! She's best known for The Tale of Genji,  
the very first novel in recorded history!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It takes place during the Heian period, focusing specifically on noble society and the exploits of its titular character Hikaru Genji.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But Murasaki Shikibu was also a famous tanka poet. Some of her poems are included in the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu, which is still used in karuta to this day.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She's the tanka poet who wrote The Tale of Genji!  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
As a Heroic Spirit, she manifested as a Caster,  
and I believe she specializes in Eastern magecraft.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The results speak for themselves. She used her own magical energy to make this underground library from scratch...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...converted all the books saved as files in our database into physical objects...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...and now lends them out to the Servants and staff for free.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Magecraft...?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
You think I created this library with magecraft...?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-yes. Didn't you...?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...Uh, yes. I suppose...I must have.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I consider this a type of onmyoudou myself...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
A type of phenomenon where something miraculous is spun beyond mortal ken and bound with the mind.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
If such beautiful things as that are what you call magecraft...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...then I am sure what you said must be true, Lady Mash.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...To be perfectly honest...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...I was never very good at onmyoudou back in the Heian period.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
It is only now, as a Servant, that I find myself in command of so many skills I could never have managed before.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I still have much to learn as a Caster, but I hope I can be of use to all of you nonetheless.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Glad to have you with us!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Thank you, Master. It is a pleasure to be here.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...Now, having said that...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I'm so terribly sorry!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...I've made a terrible mistake!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I really wanted to do things right this time,  
and make a fabulous Heroic Spirit debut...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
But then, it just happened...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
One of the books from a collection I made using my magical energy got away from me!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Got away? So, you mean...a book's gone berserk?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Yes, that's right. It was just this morning,  
when I was organizing the archive...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
There we go.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Phew. I think that's enough stocking up for today.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I feel bad, putting so many of these books away. People poured their hearts and souls into writing these words.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I only hope they find their way to someone who truly appreciates them one day...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Hm? Now what's this book?  
That's strange. I don't think I recognize it...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
What!?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Why is it floating!?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Eek!!!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
H-hey, what are you doing?  
Is that...!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I put that in my bag specifically so...!  
S-stop! Don't absorb it!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Give that back to me this instant!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Ah!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Oh no. Is it...gone!?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...This is all my fault.  
I should never have been so careless.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Now one of the books I'd long kept in my library's archive has taken on a cursed life of its own.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
When it is not feeding on all the information and magical energy it can find in its vicinity...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...it runs around endlessly in an instinctual act of self-preservation.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I've come to calling it the Cursed Book.  
(Sniff)...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou, fou.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Back when I used to serve the Empress, Lady Shoushi, the other ladies-in-waiting used to pick on me for being too highbrow...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I was so saddened by that experience that I refused to leave my chambers for a time...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
It wasn't until I began feigning the vapidity of an airhead that I only just started to fit in at work...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
But I really wanted to get it right this time!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I was so determined to make a perfect debut as the Heroic Spirit of Books, and that you would all be glad I was here...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...(Sniff) But now, I've gone and ruined it all...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't worry, everything will work out.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It sounds like we just need to get that book back, no?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Master! If this book is dangerous, we can't just let it run around doing whatever it wants!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...Y-you mean, you're not going to chastise me,  
Lady Mash? [♂ Lord /♀ Lady] Fujimaru?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course not. Besides, everyone loves the new library.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nah, it's fine. Everyone makes mistakes.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Besides, we know from experience that all bets are off when it's Valentine's season!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Besides, we're in the legendary Wandering Sea right now. Anything could happen here!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Hm? Oh, good, it seems that was the right switch.  
Can you hear me?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Semiramis?  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Yes, it is I.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Da Vinci was feeling ill, so I had little choice but to take over communications for her.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Now, uh, regarding the reason I am calling...  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
You see, um, we seem to have an,  
ah...emergency on our hands...  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
I noticed a strange book drawing near to my magical energy reserves I had set aside specifically for this year's Valentine's Day...  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
...and it gobbled up every last drop. There is nothing left for this year's chocolate production at all.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did you say a strange book!?  
   
**Mash:**   
She did, Senpai! That must be the Cursed Book...!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
All of it!?  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...I'm so sorry...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Semiramis:**   
It didn't seem to be one of the Demonic Books we usually face. Did it come from that library, by any chance?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Yes, it did! Oh no, this is terrible...!  
This is just what I was afraid of!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
It's going around attacking people...!  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Hm? What was that? This control panel is so strange,  
it's hard to make heads or tails of it...  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Hmm. It looks like a number of magical energy signals are headed your way. You'll need to handle them on your own.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fo, fou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
This is all my fault. I am so, so sorry.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I have to put an end to this before anyone else gets hurt! Please, let me handle it!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No way! We'll fight with you!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No way! It's too dangerous to fight on your own!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
A-all right!  
...Then let's go!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
The hostile entities have been eliminated!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I can't believe the Cursed Book is transforming into a monster...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There it is again...!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Don't worry. It won't attack anyone ever again.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I'll make sure of it!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Cursed Book has been recovered...  
Does that mean this case is now closed?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I'm afraid not. Just a moment...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...There, I've completed my analysis.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
This is not the original Cursed Book. It's a separate book that was given some of the stolen chocolate resources.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So, the Cursed Book can use the magical energy it absorbed to make copies itself. Then, if we don't do something...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Yes. It won't stop until every book in the library has been similarly cursed.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
But, if we can recover the original Cursed Book, we should be able to neutralize all of the copies with a single recovery ritual!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou, fou!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
For the moment, I've sealed off all the books in this library, so now it will only be able to curse books that have already been checked out.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
In that case, it should not be too difficult to find this Cursed Book.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
So, be quick about it, Fujimaru!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, yeah, I know. It's all up to me again.  
   
**Semiramis:**   
One “yeah” is quite enough, thank you.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
By the way, what was the deal with those Choco Dragon Tooth Warriors...?  
   
**Semiramis:**   
They were the same as the ones from last year, no?  
Then the Cursed Book must have made them as well.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...Yes, it did. I am so sorry.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
...Murasaki Shikibu, was it?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Y-yes?  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
If indeed you are of noble upbringing,  
then do not be so quick to bow your head.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
...Hmph.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Y-yes, you're right.  
I'm so sorr&ndash;I mean, thank you.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
[♂ Lord /♀ Lady] Fujimaru, I can't thank you enough for all your help.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Having had a chance to participate in a battle as a Servant myself now, I understand how woefully inexperienced I am.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I feel bad that Lord Seimei wasted so much of his time trying to teach such a poor student as me...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
But inexperienced as I may be, I will do whatever I must to clean up this mess I have made!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll help too, Murasaki.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Thank you. Truly.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I will never forget this debt I owe you,  
[♂ Lord /♀ Lady] Fujimaru of Chaldea.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou! Kyaaau!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I guess that means we're going on a book hunt then, Senpai! Look, even Fou is excited about it!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
So I see! All right then, this librarian is officially taking some time off!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
After all, those books aren't going to hunt themselves!  
  
   
## Section 2: Chaldea is Delicious  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I see. This certainly is a lively place...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
First time at a cafeteria?  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
In fact, yes.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Usually, I prefer to keep to myself, surrounded by nothing more than books and words.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I have no wish to boast, but even as a child, I would frequently read books meant for male scholars.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I take it you don't usually leave the library much?  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
No, I suppose I don't.  
My intention is not to be a shut-in, though...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...but I suppose I do usually end up perusing my library's collections whenever I have a spare moment.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I was unaware just how much I had neglected to get to know so many others. This simply will not do.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
People often gather at the cafeteria, so it should be the perfect place to look for a lead on the Cursed Books!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou???  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Semiramis and I will be supporting you and Murasaki Shikibu from the Command Room, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Mr. Holmes is on break, and Da Vinci seems to be genuinely exhausted, so...  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Never mind Holmes.  
The reason for his indisposition is hardly a secret.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Da Vinci was actually having trouble walking straight, so it's clear that she should sit this one out.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Now then, as for this “original Cursed Book”  
or whatev&ndash;  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Oh? Is that yet another new face I spot?  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
At first glance you'd think you weren't getting enough to eat, but you've clearly been packing the pounds on in other places.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Welp, no matter how impossible your proportions might be, we cats don't turn away customers.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
So go ahead and help yourself to some of this cat's home cooking, woof! I'll even throw in a ninety-nine-percent newbie discount!  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
What's going on here?  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Oh, if it isn't Fujimaru...and the librarian!  
What a nice surprise to see you here. I'm guessing you must be hungry.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
And the librarian lady looks real down in the dumps.  
How about a sandwich? Everyone loves sandwiches.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Oh, wait. Sorry, lady with the beautiful hands,  
but we cats just aren't cut out to cook bookworms...  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Not for lack of trying, mind. It's just that we can't find the buggers no matter how hard we look...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I, uh, I see...  
Um, do you all know this cat woman, or...?  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Sorry 'bout that.  
Try not to pay too much attention to what she says.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Nice to see you here in the cafeteria for once, Murasaki Shikibu. This your first time leaving the library?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see you know everyone besides Cat.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're pretty famous, Murasaki.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I-I-I'm so sorr&ndash;  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Ahem. She and that Master there are looking for a book. One bound with an unusual type of magical energy.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Would any of you know anything about such a book,  
Heroic Spirits of the kitchen?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
(Lady Semiramis...)  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
I mean, it's not like the ONLY thing we ever do is cook...  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
I've definitely seen a lot of Servants reading books lately...but I can't say I've seen any quite like that.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
There was that one writer Servant.  
He's pretty much always got a book with him...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...but lately, he's been bringing whole stacks of them to the table. Did so just this morning, in fact.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Oh, right! He has been reading even more than usual lately, hasn't he.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
Guess it's the new hotness.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
True. Heck, even we've been reading a lot lately.  
It's so much fun, learning all these new things.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Thanks for waiting, ladies and germs!  
Cat's back with an all-new entree!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
This baby's overflowing with spice née intelligence, and is the perfect addition to any cafeteria kitchen!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I give you...us kitchen Heroic Spirits' unsung hero!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
“Shirasagi's One Hundred Recipes:  
Cooking So Simple Even Batty Can Do It”!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hold up!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If this is going where I think it's going...!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Huh? Is there something weird about this book I had Raikou borrow for me?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Pardon me, Lady Cat!  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
What the woof!? Why did my book jump outta my paws like a bunny outta hell!?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I knew it! This is one of the Cursed Books!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm picking up an unusual magical energy reading from that book! I'll call it a Cursed Book Signal for the time being!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Pardon me, everyone!  
I need to recover this book right away!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Emiya:**   
...That oughta do it.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Cursed Book, return to me!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Cursed Book has been recovered! It doesn't have much magical energy, so I'm guessing&ndash;  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Yes. It seems this was not the original Cursed Book. Fortunately, we can at least be certain that it was one with which the original shared its magical energy.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I apologize once again for all the trouble I've caused you, kind chefs.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Hahaha, if you think this is trouble, you obviously haven't been in many cafeterias! I'm still not sure what's going on here, but don't worry about us.  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Compared to you-know-who seeing Nero's face and going wild, Salieri acting up, one of Phantom's episodes, or Berserkers you can't reason with...  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Well, let's just say we're used to things not always running smoothly around here.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
For sure. There's pretty much always something on fire in the kitchen, figuratively and literally.  
  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
It's gonna take way more than a little flying book action to make us bat an eye.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
There you have it.  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
If you're in a hurry, Murasaki Shikibu,  
we won't keep you here...  
  
   
**Emiya:**   
...but I hope you'll come back sometime for a more leisurely cup of tea when you can.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Thank you, everyone. That sounds lovely.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Next stop: the writer Servants' room!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood!  
  
   
## Section 3: Writer's Path  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Andersen, my friend! My comrade in pens! Would you be so kind as to grab me a book from that mountain over there?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Are you just incapable of addressing someone without foisting friendship or whatnot upon them?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
You know, on second thought, I don't have to do a damn thing for you. Get it yourself if you want it that badly.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
That mountain of books is eerily well-balanced.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
If I pull any one of them out, it'll cause a book-a-lanche that would certainly bury me alive and then come after you.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
What a shame that is to hear! Though I must say, if you had to die, wouldn't being buried by books be the best way to go?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Don't be an idiot. I could never rest in peace if I went out like that.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I'm already killing myself to get these drafts done. If I have to die, I want it to be by something other than books for once.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Hmm, I see. I suppose that is one way in which you and I differ. You always put your life above all else&ndash;even your stories!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Hmph. Guess it just goes to show that, unlike you, I'm not so happy-go-lucky as to want to filter everything that happens to me through the lens of comedy.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Anyway, what's that book you just finished reading there?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter.  
I plan on delving into The Tales of Ise next.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Oh? I didn't realize Far Eastern literature was your thing now, Lord Shakespeare. Hahaha, it's mine too, would you believe?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
As you can see, I've most recently read the Kokinshu, the Gosenshu, and the Shuishu!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
You don't say, Lord Caesar! What strange coincidences are these! Your choices do strike me as oddly lopsided, but never mind that!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I should have known a man of your grace would appreciate the finer pleasures of poetry.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Grace? Your ulterior motives couldn't be plainer if you had them tattooed to your foreheads, you boobs.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
You just heard those are the widowed librarian's favorites and you're looking for a way to get into her ruffly skirt.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Other people's wives!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Are something special!  
  
   
**Dictator & Playwright:**   
(Secret handshake)  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
...(Sigh) Sorry about that, guys. I can't always stop them from horsing around like that in here.  
  
   
**Red Hare:**   
Horsing around?  
  
   
**Red Hare:**   
Don't be absurd. I am Lu Bu, obviously.  
  
   
**Red Hare:**   
What is Lu Bu doing reading books, you ask?  
Good question. All I can say is that...I am Lu Bu. Yup.  
  
   
**Red Hare:**   
So if I read a book, that means Lu Bu reads it too.  
Do you understand my logic?  
  
   
**Chen Gong:**   
You're the one who's mistaken, Red Hare.  
I believe Lord Andersen was addressing Master, not us.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Good grief. So much for my idea to move to a real study instead of the simulator just so I could bring in real books.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
It's so damn noisy in here I can't get anything done.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
At this rate, I'd've been better off holing up in a hotel and working on a Little Mermaid sequel or something.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Eh, why bother. Anyone with half a brain could see the twist that she's actually half sea serpent coming a kilometer away.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It sure is lively in here!  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, it's very lively! Usually the study is kind of...quiet, but today it's like...well...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Seems like things escalated quickly here!  
   
**Mash:**   
Uh, yes, it does!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Usually, it's just Andersen and Shakespeare in here, along with the occasional visit from Caesar...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But it's very lively in here today.  
It's almost like...uh...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Red Hare:**   
Neigh.  
  
   
**Red Hare:**   
What were you going to say, young lady?  
That it's like a stable in here?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
N-no, it's not that. I was going to say it's like...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...a writers' lounge...?  
  
   
**Red Hare:**   
Oh, okay. Sorry about that. I ought to know better since I'm Lu Bu. Say, just out of curiosity,  
how do you feel about horses?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Horses? Well, uh...I think they have very gentle eyes.  
  
   
**Red Hare:**   
Neigh hah!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Fooou!  
  
   
**Red Hare:**   
Oh, sorry again. I was just so happy to hear that I couldn't help myself. Not that I have any connection to horses, of course, seeing as I'm Lu Bu and all!  
  
   
**Chen Gong:**   
Easy, Red Hare. Why don't you take a break and go have some of the feed I brought along? See, it's right over there.  
  
   
**Red Hare:**   
Neigh-heeeigh!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...There are so many different Heroic Spirits here!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I had no idea there were any that resembled horses like that.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
If I'd stayed in the library, I might have gone my entire manifestation without ever learning a thing.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
And then there are all the different ways they interact with one another... What a moving sight.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
And above all...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...it's such a thrill to see Heroic Spirits of the authors I admire go about their daily lives!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
This is one of the luckiest days of my life!  
Well, of my manifestation, that is!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're quite the fangirl aren't you?  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
A-am I?  
Perhaps I am...  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's one way to look at the bright side!  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Ah!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I was so happy that I forgot myself...  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I was like this back when I was alive during the Heian period, too. I was always in awe of people who had proven their intelligence and talent through their beautiful poetry.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
In fact, I would often introduce myself by saying, “Murasaki Shikibu, aka Fujiwara-no-Kaoruko! My mental age is 19 years old, and my type of man is anyone like Lord Ariwara-no-Narihira!”  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
N-Not that Ariwara-no-Narihira and I lived in the same time period, of course... He was a great source of inspiration for me, however.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Please, tell me more!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I would love to hear all about the day-to-day life of the Far East's most esteemed female author!  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
And I must say, it is fascinating to hear you speak in person! The very lilt of your voice is enough to stir my pen!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Oh yes. There truly is something special about women of nobility.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Your demeanor is exceptionally pleasant as well.  
You practically radiate poetic sentiment.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...Forgive me for being so brazen, but I have also heard rumors of your palace romances.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
If you would be so kind, I would like nothing more than to interview you about the ups and downs of romance in Far Eastern noble society.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Oh? Does that mean your interest in her is purely professional, Lord Shakespeare?  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Hahaha, not that it matters to me one way or the other, of course. Hahaha.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Hahaha! I believe you had best hold your tongue, friend, lest your dear wife make an unannounced appearance!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
If you don't put a stop to this, they're going to go on leering forever. Go on. Speak up.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
You cursing them out would go a long way toward keeping these fools in line.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
O-oh no, I couldn't possibly! I'm...I'm just so honored to have such illustrious company take an interest in me.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Hm?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Well, um...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I know it's presumptuous of me, but if you should ever be inclined to write a new story...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...I was kind of hoping you might be willing to donate it to my library?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
What, now that you're a Heroic Spirit, you fancy yourself an editor? Not that I don't understand how you feel!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
This is a chance you won't ever find elsewhere!  
Not even in heaven or hell!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Believe me, whenever Shakespeare writes something new, I make sure to read it before anyone&ndash;  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
...Never mind. I shouldn't have said that. There's something about you that makes me relax my guard. Maybe because you remind me of someone?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I...think that's enough of this. Yes.  
No more. This conversation is over.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Now, what are you lot doing here, anyway?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Surely you didn't come here just to see which of these idiots can embarrass themselves the worst.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
What is it? Go on, spit it out.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
A Cursed Book, huh. I guess I could see that happening with Eastern curses.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I don't mind sussing it out for you, but I barely even know any magecraft, let alone curses.  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Likewise! Hahaha, after all,  
we are students of the pen, not the wand!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
I'm not even a Caster!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
There you have it. So if you want to turn the place upside down to look for this book, feel free.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I still haven't cleaned up here since the move,  
so it's not like you could mess it up more.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Okay! In that case, I'll just go ahead...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Oh...! There ARE Cursed Books in this study!  
More than one, in fact!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm seeing their signals on my end, too! They're rapidly boosting their magical energy in response to your detection curse!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Look out, Senpai!  
They're about to take on physical form!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's get to work!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Come on, authors, help us out here!  
   
**Andersen:**   
...I swear. How many times have I told you I don't do hard labor?  
  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Now, Andersen don't be like that. I believe Master here is ordering us to help for our own sakes. Especially since we haven't partaken in the farming of Embers as of late!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
In other words, a little exercise would do us good, eh?  
True, I suppose I have let myself go juuust a bit.  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Besides, now that I think about it, this is an excellent opportunity to show off in front of a most exquisite lady! Two birds, one glorious stone!  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
Don't you worry about a thing, beautiful librarian.  
Just stand back and witness our prowess!!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Okay!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Red Hare:**   
Now's your chance, beautiful black-garbed lady!  
  
   
**J：Commentary:**   
Update: Red Hare heard the commotion and came back to help in the interval! Meanwhile, the author Heroic Spirits were entirely wiped out!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Thank you, kind horse with the gallant,  
entirely unhorselike voice!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Cursed Books, return to me!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You've recovered more of the Cursed Books! But...I'm afraid they don't have much magical energy either.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...Indeed.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Still, while they may not be the original Cursed Book, I can't let them run around doing whatever they please.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Thank goodness I was able to recover them.  
Thank you all so much for your help.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Hmm. Books checked out from the underground library, huh...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
You said it's possible this original Cursed Book could be mixed in among books like that, right?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I did.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Well, I remember seeing that girl carrying an armful of them.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Which girl?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who are you talking about?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Andersen:**   
You know, that one with the glasses who's into manga and doujin and stuff.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh! I know who he means now, Senpai!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Osakabehime!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Andersen:**   
Let's go pay her a visit then.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
What? Her room's not that far from my study,  
and the least I can do is show you the way.  
  
   
## Section 4: Himeji Doujin Monogatari  
   
**Andersen:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
...She's not answering.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm not reading Osakabehime's magical energy signal either. It looks like she's not in her room.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's also no Cursed Book Signal, so I don't think we need to worry about getting inside.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I see...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I didn't think she ever left her room if she could help it. ...Well, at least I have an idea where she might be.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Now that I've come this far, I might as well show you the rest of the way, too. At least it'll be something different.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I'm so sorry to make you go to all this trouble...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Eh, I'm just helping out a bit on my way back to my easy chair. If you really want to thank me, you can lend me one of your rarer books.  
  
   
**J：Commentary:**   
Despite his cold, off-putting demeanor...  
  
   
**J：Commentary:**   
...Mr. Andersen found himself unable to abandon Murasaki in her time of need.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Hm? What is it? Why're you looking at me like that?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
When did we get a commentary track here?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You mean I wasn't just imagining things!?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Andersen:**   
Commentary?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Ah! I-I-I'm so sorry, Lord Andersen!  
I just...couldn't help it...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Wh-what was that just now!? Did anyone else see that commentary floating above your heads?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...Oh, this is just mortifying.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
This is the only technique I ever managed to learn from Lord Abe-no-Seimei...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Taizan Commentary Fest.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Taizan...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Commentary Fest...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Merely something I came up with. Nothing to do with the resurrection ritual of the Taoist god with a similar name.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I didn't even want to learn it, but I acquired it almost by osmosis while I was around Lord Seimei...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
It's a dreadful technique that exemplifies the worst of Lord Seimei's mischievousness...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
It creates a sort of running commentary that anyone can see or hear...save the one being commented on!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
The commentary cannot lie outright,  
but it can reveal very painful truths!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I remember this one scary monk once told me “Such shame...such cowardice! Mmmm, yes, I have seen this technique's true nature.”  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
It still gives me chills to think about it...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A scary monk, huh...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mmmm, something about the way he speaks sounds familiar...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
He warned it was not a technique to be used lightly,  
b-but I'm afraid I went and activated it in spite of myself...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I'm afraid I often end up doing that whenever I relax my guard... It's almost like a curse...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-are you sure it isn't?  
Because it really does sound like one...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Please forgive me, Lord Andersen!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Hmph. I got commented on all the time,  
it's nothing new to me.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
How many critical and faux-critical reviews do you think we writers have suffered by now? Not to mention all that painful amateur analysis!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
If I had a dime for every slanderous accusation that's been thrown my way, I could have retired after my first book!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Don't be an idiot, Shikibu.  
You're an author; you know what it's like.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
We writers are expected to have a monologue or two ready to go at all times.  
  
   
**A：Andersen (Commentator):**  
“...Not to mention, this commentary must be from the great Eastern genius writer, Murasaki Shikibu.”  
  
   
**A：Andersen (Commentator):**  
“What greater honor could there be than that? Any man,  
no, writer worth his salt should be so lucky.”  
  
   
**A：Andersen (Commentator):**  
Thus, Andersen, still smiling, secretly decided to brag about this to Shakespeare later.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Lord Andersen...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ander...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(I think...I just saw the ultimate tsundere in action...)  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Andersen:**   
Hm? Now don't you start too, Fujimaru.  
I told you not to worry about it.  
  
   
**J：Commentary:**   
Indeed, Mr. Andersen, with his sky blue hair and matching eyes, spoke not a hint of falsehood.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Oh no, there it goes again...!  
I'm so sorry!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Oh gosh, oh gosh...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
...So you really don't have any control over it, do you. Since I was the one commented on, I obviously have no idea what it said...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
...but as a fellow author, I doubt you could have had it say anything that was wrong. Stop apologizing so much.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Now come on. We're going to find Osakabehime and take care of these Cursed Books!  
  
   
**J：Commentary:**   
“Life in Chaldea isn't quite like life anywhere else. Here, adventure could knock on your door at any time at all.”  
  
   
**J：Commentary:**   
Thus, resigned to his fate, Mr. Andersen decided he may as well stick around until the Cursed Books were disposed of once and for all.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There it goes again...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is...the library's reception desk.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I guess this means we're back where we started...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Osakabehime's been coming to the library a lot lately, so since she wasn't in her room, I figured we'd find her here.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Look, there's a note left on your desk.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Let's take a look. Hmm.  
Whoever wrote it has lovely handwriting.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
“Hi, Librarian. You weren't here when I showed up, so being the kind princess that I am, I'll put these books back on the shelves myself.”  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
What kind, beautiful lettering. I can almost see her personality leaping off the page.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Oh?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I just realized I forgot to tell you!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In addition to running the library, Murasaki Shikibu also holds calligraphy and creative writing classes.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, and proper letter-writing too...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I see. That does sound like it would be right up her alley.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I just wanted to be of whatever help I could to anyone who wished they had beautiful handwriting...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...or who wanted to better express their innermost feelings.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
It's not much, but I do hope it's something.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
All right, let's go look for Osakabehime. She said she was going to put some books back on their shelves, right?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Just a moment, please. It would seem...that her note wasn't the only one left here!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Um...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
“Then I will too.” “Me too.” “Me three.”  
“Same.” “As shall I.” “Likewise.”  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
...Ugh, great! Just our luck that they all had to run off inside the library!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go after them!  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Okay!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'll close the hall to the library, just in case!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe we should seal off the entrance, too.  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai! I'll make sure to close off the hall to the library.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
If anyone else shows up there, I'll send a message letting them know to wait until you get there.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
That should work. All right, come on.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Hm hm hmm♪  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
What a nice princess I am, putting books back where I got them♪  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...I guess that would technically be against the rules in most libraries...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...but it looks like they don't even keep track of who's checked out what in this one.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I'm sure it'll be daijoubu since I let the librarian know what I was doing. Hm hm hmm.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There she is!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Good, we found her.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Oh... It's her!  
The girl in glasses who frequents my library...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Osakabehime, wait! Don't return that boook!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Master! A-a-a-and Murasaki-paisen!?  
I mean, Senpai!?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Oh gosh, oh gosh oh gosh...!  
N-n-n-now what am I gonna do!?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Murasaki and I both love books, and we're both Japanese Servants who are big into literature! There can't be room for both of us in the lineup!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
This is exactly why I've been trying to avoid running into her and Ma-chan at the same time!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
...Fou?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I wouldn't say you're THAT similar...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm...not sure what to say...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Oh come on! We're both into books, we're both gloomy...  
We're practically identical twins! Right, Ma-chan!?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
U-um, Osakabehime!? Putting aside how similar we might be, could you let me see those books you checked out!?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Also, have you noticed any books you don't recognize, by any chance!?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Huh? You want to see my books?  
Well sure, that's fine with...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Wait. Y-y-you mean, here? In front of Ma-chan!?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Kyaa!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
How is my book floating on its own...!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is a Cursed Book Signal if ever I saw one!  
It's very strong, too!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
So given what happened in the study, I'm guessing these things turn into enemies and try to attack us?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
That's right! But once we defeat it,  
it will turn back into the book it used to&ndash;  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
N-n-n-no, please! Anything but that!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I can't let Ma-chan see what I was reading!!!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Cursed Book has transformed into an Eastern-style hydra! Be careful, it has a lot of magical energy, too!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
S-stay back! Please!  
Yamete kudastooop!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry about this, Osakabehime!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll do my best not to look at the title!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Nooo!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
H-huh!? It looks like...Osakabehime has sided with the Cursed Book serpent...!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
She really was serious about not wanting Master here to see what the book was... The author in me sympathizes.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
All right, I'm not here to judge. Let's take down this serpent and I guess try not to hurt Osakabehime much!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Andersen:**   
It's over. Eh, you keep writing about certain things long enough, you're bound to go a little crazy from time to time.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou. Fooou.  
(Special Translation: You call this a LITTLE crazy?)  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Don't worry, Osakabehime! I'll do my best to keep the Cursed Book's title out of sight while I recover it!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I've confirmed that you've recovered the Cursed Book.  
It does have a lot of magical energy...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...but it's still less than a quarter of the energy that was stolen. Which means this isn't the original, either...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
(Sniff)...  
(Sniff)...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Waaah! This is a nightmare! Not only did I make a complete baka of myself, I didn't even put up a good fight...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
As if being too similar to her wasn't bad enough... I'm not even a good writer. All I've ever made is doujin...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I've never written any historic novels, let alone any masterpieces or classics... (Sniff)...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Why would Ma-chan want to keep a pale imitation like me around when [♂ he /♀ she] could have the real thing with Murasaki-senpai...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
(Sob)  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's okay. Really.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
(Sob)  
Ma-chan...?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nobody could ever replace you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're not an imitation of her at all.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**J：Commentary:**   
Fujimaru spoke from the heart, without a hint of dishonesty.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Is that...Murasaki-senpai's strange, sort of automatic commentary track technique? The one that only says things that are true...?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I call it Taizan Commentary Fest. Osakabehime, [♂ Lord /♀ Lady]  
Fujimaru is right. You and I are nothing alike.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
We may both like to put pen to paper to express our thoughts and feelings...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...but in my mind, that only makes us comrades, regardless of our different time periods.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Waaah! Paisen! Ma-chan!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Gomenasorry! I should never have acted up like that! But I'm really, really glad Ma-chan never saw that book's title!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
If [♂ he /♀ she] had, I think my poor little princess kokoro would have brokoro into a million pieces... (Sniff)  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
There, there. You have nothing to apologize for.  
This was all my fault to begin with.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
(Sniff) Paisen...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
There, there.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm glad everything worked out.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You two really are good friends, aren't you?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Andersen:**   
Hey. In case you've forgotten, we're a long way from happily ever after here. We still haven't found the original Cursed Book, and we don't even know where to look.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
So come on, let's get moving. We can start by checking all the books those other Servants came here to return!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's so nice of you to help us like this, Andersen!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Believe me, if there was someone else you could ask, I'd be gone in a heartbeat. But, in for a penny, in for a pound, as my colleague might say.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
...All right, how long are you gonna keep cuddling each other!? Let's go already!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Okay!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I-I still don't know what's going on here,  
but I'll come along too!  
  
   
## Section 5: The Sorrows of Young Valkyrie  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
...This should be the place.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Hmm, it'd be kind of a waste to return it now.  
Maybe I'll hang onto it a little longer.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
There is no need for that.  
Remember, we are the Valkyries.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
As long as one of us has read a book to completion,  
it will forever persist in our shared memory.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Yeah, I know, but there's just something about paper books.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
It's exciting to turn a new page,  
even when you know what happens next.  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
True... That is a good point.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
I disagree. One can easily attain similar feelings even with electronic and Spiritronic information.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Besides...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Sentiment is for humans.  
As are emotions.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
As Valkyries, we have no need for either.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Aww man.  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
Very well then, let's return these books.  
We can inform the librarian of their ret&ndash;  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There! I found three Heroic Spirits who seem to have come here to return some books!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
A yuri story about three robot sisters... That could totally be moe...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Oh, it's those three sisters. I remember them.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
The Norse Valkyries, huh.  
All right, let's see if they can be reasoned with.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Heeey! Valkyries!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't return those books just yet!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...Master.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Huh? Why're you here, Master?  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
Estimation: Master has found something suspect about our actions...  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
...and wishes to check the books we are about to return accordingly.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Wait, really!?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Uhh, h-hey there, Master!  
We're not up to anything weird here, I promise!  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
There's nothing suspicious about us coming to the library a lot lately. It's not like we've all been checking out every single romance novel we can fi&ndash;  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Hildr.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Gyah!  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
That's true. I borrowed Aesop's Fables, and cannot yet say for certain that it has no tales of romance.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Really? I got Little Women, and there was definitely some love plots in that.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
What about you, Thrúd?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
I borrowed, uh...Wuthering Heights.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Oho, fascinating. That's a tale of real passion.  
A very grown-up choice.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
If it's passion you're looking for, you should try The Tale of Genji next. In fact, I could read it aloud for you right now if you like.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
L-Lord Andersen...!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
(N-no way! That's downright sadistic! Does this mean four-eyes here was actually a heartless shota type all along!?)  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
The Tale of Genji?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
No need.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
I have already read it.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Oh yeah, you didn't waste any time checking that one out. I remember it was one of the very first stories to be added to our shared memories.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
It was a very...enigmatic story. It depicted mind games, affection, and other human things in great detail...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Yet despite that, it was also strangely entrancing.  
What about it?  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Hmm, you don't say.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Yes, I do say.  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
You do?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
I do.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
(Gasp) Wait! That does not mean I... It's not as though I have any interest in human thinking myself...  
  
   
**J：Commentary:**   
The two younger Valkyries, delighted to learn of their eldest sister's obsession, could not contain their glee.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Huh!?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
M-more commentary!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe this really is a curse...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Thrúd:**   
What? Why is my copy of Wuthering Heights floating in midair!?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, I'm getting another Cursed Book Signal! It appears to have the same amount of magical energy as the last one!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Damn, another red herring. But we can't just leave it here. We'll have to deal with it now.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Yosh! This is my chance to prove I can be useful!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I'll start recovering this book right now! I'm sorry about this, Valkyries! I'll explain later, I promise!  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
Situation understood. Emergency in the library.  
Preparing to counteract threat now.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Don't worry! We've got this!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...Very well. I, too, will assist you.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Cursed Book has transformed into a giant ice beast!  
Please be careful, everyone!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Very well then... Let us begin!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
...Confirmed: The battle has concluded.  
Well done, everyone.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Great work, team!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Murasaki! The Cursed Book has taken physical form again!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Right! Not to worry, I have this under control.  
Cursed Book, return to me!  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...It would seem the emergency has been resolved.  
Now then, if you will excuse us.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Huh? I don't think it's completely resolved yet, Thrúd.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Andersen said this wasn't the right one, so doesn't that mean the original threat is still out there?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
...Then, the three of us will take a different route to search the library. We will report back if we detect any similar magical energy readings.  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
How does that sound, Master?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It sounds great. Thanks!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That'd be a huge help.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
Thrúd...  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Did you just smile?  
  
   
**Thrúd:**   
Of course not. Come, you two. Let's go.  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
...Hmph. Well, see you later, Master!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Splitting your forces, huh. Not a bad idea. I don't know if they'll be able to recover any cursed books...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
...but I doubt those three will have any trouble neutralizing them if they turn into monsters again.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
All that aside...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
If all three Valkyries are capable of materializing at the same time, why don't they do so more often?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, I think I can answer that one.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's because having all three of them materialize at once uses an excessive amount of magical energy, thanks to their unique Spirit Origin Ascension pattern.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At least, that's what Da Vinci said.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
...I see. Well, we can't have them overexerting themselves, I suppose.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Well, come on then. We need to hurry up and check the books everyone else is returning too!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Right on!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It'd be great if the original's here in the library.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, it would...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There's a distinct possibility that it's hiding among the books that were lent out from the library...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But if we check each and every one of them,  
we're bound to find it eventually!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Very well! Let us be on our way!  
  
   
## Section 6: Night Travels  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Y-you'll never get this book from me, you hear!  
  
   
**J：Commentary:**   
Blackbeard, the legendary pirate, had apparently borrowed someone else's biography...  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
The hell business is it of yours what I read!?  
  
   
**J：Commentary:**   
It remains unclear exactly what Jeanne d'Arc Alter was trying to learn from her German dictionary.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
You have me all wrong, Master... I was merely curious to see what contemporary poets were writing about...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I assure you, I had no intention whatsoever of making my own modern debut in the hope of finding romance... (Strum)  
  
   
**J：Commentary:**   
Even while clearly holding a book titled “The Überbeginner's Guide to Singing” in his hands, Sir Tristan still found a way to play his harp.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
(Huff, puff...)  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Am I just seeing things...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...or did I just watch a library book I borrowed turn into a giant snake then get beaten to a pulp?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fo.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Gah! What was that all about!? If that had been a book about man's prowess in the boudoir, we'd have a fight to the death on our hands, you know!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Lucky for you that it was just a biography of Captain Kidd!  
  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I don't give a rat's ass what you dipshits think. Besides, I was just brushing up on my German with that dictionary.  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
Indeed, I too was pursuing a course of study, albeit one more focused on modern culture. What's more, my motive for doing so was chivalry itself...  
  
   
**Tristan:**   
I merely wished to gain new wings so as to surpass my fated rival, Sir Lancelot... (Strum)  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou. Fou, fo fooou? (Special Translation: Maybe we should just off Tristan now and be done with it?)  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I do hope you can all forgive me. I promise I will take great care not to let anything like this happen again!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry but it's so we can save the chocolate for Valentine's Day!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We had to do this to save Valentine's Day, so...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
What's that? Did you say Valentine's?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Oho, why didn't you say so sooner! Of course I understand! Hell, I'll even help you out myself!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Besides, I see you're accompanied by a Servant who's got a mind for the fine arts, and an even finer body...  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Once I show her what I've got,  
I bet I'll be rolling in chocolate!  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Maybe I'll get enough chocolate to make a trophy out of it! Neeheehee!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're a good egg sometimes, Blackbeard.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm counting on you!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Woohoo! You just leave it to me, Master!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There, you've been through the whole library now. Great work, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The only place you haven't visited yet is the archive that's usually kept off-limits.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Everywhere else has been thoroughly checked.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Guess this means those three were the last Servants to return here with checked-out books.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
We've got a good number of Cursed Books now,  
but we still haven't found the original.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
That's the one that made off with all the magical energy resources that were meant for Valentine's chocolate, right?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right. We've recovered a good amount of it by now, but we still don't have as much as last year.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Hmph. All things considered, it doesn't sound like there was that much magical energy involved.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Come to cases, I could just spin a sob story for one of the really rich ancient kings and get them to cover the difference.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I guess that would work, but...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't know...  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Andersen:**   
...Okay, yeah. That would be sort of an anticlimax,  
especially given all we've done...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Problems like these should be overcome by a protagonist who's aware of their failings and is motivated to face them.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Isn't that right, Murasaki?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Yes! Absolutely!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
If we can't find the original Cursed Book in the library, I'm prepared to go back and search the rest of the base.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, if that's what you want,  
I can reopen the hall at any time...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...but let me try scanning the entire library first, just to make sure the Cursed Book isn't hiding in there.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Good idea. It'd be a real pain if this scoundrel were to flee the moment the shutters were opened.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks, Mash!  
   
**Mash:**   
No problem!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Just make sure you don't push yourself too hard, okay?  
   
**Mash:**   
I won't, Senpai.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
It will take about thirty minutes for the scan to finish, so this should be a good opportunity for you to rest.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Oh, then why don't we go to my room behind the reception desk? It should be perfect for a break.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
A-as in, your private room? Oh wow, I've been to this library lots of times, but I've never seen inside there!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
This is kind of doki-doki, isn't it, Ma-chan?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I...guess?  
   
**Andersen:**   
As long as I get to sit down and rest my poor aching feet, I couldn't care less where it is. Now come on.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There is something cool about having your home attached to your workplace.  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Yes! Exactly!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
It's right this way. Please, follow me.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou, fooou!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Oh man, oh man, oh man! So this is what Murasaki-senpai's room looks like!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...Wait. Huh?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It looks just like a hotel room.  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...Specifically, a fancy luxury suite!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This looks like...the rooms we had in Luluhawa...  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Exactly! Considering how much time we spent there I know that room like the back of my hand!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
What's going on!?  
I don't wakarunderstand!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
D-d-do you not like it? Oh no, maybe I should have gone with tatami mats after all...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
This room seemed so nice when I found it in Chaldea's database...so I thought I'd try to recreate it myself.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
R-recreate it!?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Wow, I never knew onmyoudou could be so handy!  
It must be so nice being you, Senpai.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I'm afraid my techniques are my take on Lord Seimei's teachings, so it isn't very representative of true onmyoudou...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...but I hope it will suffice to let you all rest for now.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I don't have many fond memories of my bed in Luluhawa...but at least it's all top-notch stuff.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Ahh...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I'll go make some tea!  
You're all good with hot tea, right?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sounds good to me.  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
You got it!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'd actually prefer cold...  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Hmm, I don't know how to use chilling magecraft... Is it okay if I take a peek in your refrigerator, Senpai?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Yes, by all means. I think I still have some cold barley tea in there.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Got it!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...  
...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is everything okay?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You look like something's bothering you.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
O-oh, I'm sorry.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
You see...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...there's something I wish to recover more than anything else.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Back when I first encountered the original Cursed Book in the archive...I had a letter taken from me.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
A very precious letter&ndash;full of beautiful expressions of love...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I kept it close, but even so,  
it was taken from me so easily...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...I'm sorry. I know I don't have any right to be concerned about this.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
The only thing I should be focusing on now is bringing this situation under control.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We can be concerned about more than one thing at a time!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If this letter means that much to you, we'll just have to get it back.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Thank you, [♂ Lord /♀ Lady] Fujimaru.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Your words have lifted a tremendous weight from my shoulders.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, faaau.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...Thank you too, Lord Fou.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Shikibu. I don't have enough energy to bother sitting up right now, so I'm just going to lay down while we talk. But let me ask you this:  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Why would this book want to eat a letter?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
These Cursed Book monsters haven't had any problem defending themselves, but I've never seen one go out of their way to attack anyone.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
There's got to be some connection here.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
So we've got your letter.  
The Cursed Book.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
And...magical energy resources meant for producing chocolate.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I...I am a Heroic Spirit whose focus has always been putting feelings into words.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Especially feelings of one person caring deeply for another.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
So all the books I have created are sensitive to feelings as well...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I'm not entirely sure, but I think that must be what caused this mess.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
That is why...I believe the Cursed Book eats feelings.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Okay, I'm awake! Now we're getting somewhere!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Master. What's the main thing you know about the Cursed Books?  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They feed on nearby information.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They feed on nearby magical energy.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Andersen:**   
Right. They consume both nearby information,  
and nearby magical energy.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
But they don't do so indiscriminately.  
There's a condition that needs to be met first.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
To borrow Shikibu's words...the Cursed Books focus on information laden with emotion as well as magical energy.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
The former explains why one ate her letter,  
and the latter explains...  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Valentine's chocolate resources!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Andersen:**   
Exactly.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Of course, that doesn't help us track down where the original Cursed Book is now, but at least it all makes sense.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
These Cursed Books may be a pain in the ass, but they're not going around eating anything and everything.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
So we don't have to worry about one eating, say, a Magical Reactor, or a Holy Grail, or even a Heroic Spirit's Spirit Core.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Hell, compared to the other shit we've been through,  
this is hardly a blip on the radar.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
So no one is really going to mind that you're worried about your precious letter or whatever.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hey, you look like you're feeling a little better now.  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I am!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thanks, Andersen.  
   
**Andersen:**   
Don't thank me. I was just laying it all out.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Andersen:**   
Still... Of all the things it could have been, it had to be feelings, huh. What's the deal with that?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
What, are you one of those types who bares your soul in letters, but can't actually bring yourself to give them to the person they're meant for?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Ah well, it doesn't matter either way.  
Besides, it's a fitting story for Valentine's Day.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Pardon the intrusion. I see...  
This explains a great many things.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Despite the fact that these books consume magical energy, we have yet to hear of them attacking Servants.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Nor have they flocked towards the Magical Reactor,  
or tried to break into storage area for Holy Grails.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Haha, did you say Holy Grails?  
Do you...know where they're being kept?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou!?  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Go away.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I'm back! Who's ready for some tea?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
I'll have some. Heh, just as I thought.  
You have good taste in tea leaves.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Ah, yes, that reminds me: I have a message for you.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
That Mash girl is hard at work on her scan,  
and says she will be done shortly. That is all.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks for telling us, Semiramis!  
   
**Semiramis:**   
It was nothing. Truly.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Would you mind, um...keeping an eye on Amakusa for me?  
   
**Semiramis:**   
You need not even ask. Of course.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay, tea, please!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Here you go!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Hm.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...Thank you.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...Ahh, this is so nice and warm.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...You are all so kind. So very warmhearted.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...My place in the world:  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...Why should it bring me grief?  
Mountain cherry...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Blossom in my sight,  
Were it ever so...  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Ooh, ooh, I know that one!  
You wrote it yourself!  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Yes. That's one of the tanka poems included in the Goshui Wakashu, from Japan's Heian period. To elaborate, it means&ndash;  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
“Why should I feel bad about the world I live in? If I could just look at it the same way I do flowers...”  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
There are multiple interpretations, as with any renowned poem. Some consider it a reflection on the fragility of one's own life...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
...but in this case, I think yours has the right idea.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's a lovely poem.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Not at all. If it seemed that way to you...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...that is only because it reflects what lies in your own hearts.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Ugh, you fools are far too emotional. Haven't I been telling you not to wring your hands over every little misstep?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
As for you, Osakabehime, how's a writer supposed to get any writing done if they keep bawling their eyes out with every line they write?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Or do you just plan to go your whole life and manifestation without ever finishing a single book?  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou. Fou.  
  
   
## Section 7: Letter from Chaldea  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry to interrupt your break, everyone!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But we have an emergency!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fo!?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Wh-wh-what happened!?  
Yeowch! I spilled my tea!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Several Cursed Books have destroyed the library's shutters from the outside! It looks like they broke right through the shutters' magecraft resistance!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
They're somewhere inside the underground library as we speak... And that's not all!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm also getting emergency calls from Blackbeard and the Valkyries!  
  
   
**Hildr:**   
Yeah, we found one of those monster books! We tried to punch its lights out, but it gave us the slip!  
  
   
**Ortlinde:**   
It appears to have run off towards the back of the library. To be blunt, it got away from us.  
  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I WISH it was just one or two books!  
I can't even count how many I saw!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
The original must have continued to make more while we were inside the library... This is terrible...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, actually...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I found a single Cursed Book in the hall right before I finished my scan of the whole library.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I was just about to tell you about it when the shutters were destroyed...  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
You think that's the original?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's very possible. I'm looking at the readings for all the Cursed Books that broke into the library...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...and they're all headed straight for the one that was hiding in the hall!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
To the hall!  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
I-is this... Are we getting to the final battle?  
Sh-should I even be here!?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Of course you're going to help us fight. Now come on! I'll show what it means to bring a story to a satisfying conclusion!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's where we saw Blackbeard, Jeanne, and Tristan, right?  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Yes, that's right!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Please be careful, everyone!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Here! The hall is right up this way!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
J-just a second! The Cursed Book Signal is showing some strange activity...!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Lady Mash?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
All the individual Cursed Book Signals seem to have coalesced into a single book...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I can tell they've all met up in the hall...but now they're headed to the space behind it!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It looks like this is&ndash;  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...The archive?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Let me pull up a map; it'll be faster. Yup.  
There's some kind of archive right behind the hall.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
So this is where these books are now?  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This reminds me of something. It feels like...I'm looking at a beehive, or an ant colony!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
These books are perfectly positioned to build a nest around their queen!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...This whole incident started in the archive, right?  
   
**Andersen:**   
Now I see. So this queen book roamed the base creating offspring of a sort, and now they're all coming back to the nest. Well that's easy to grasp.  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So, like a homing instinct?  
   
**Andersen:**   
A homing instinct, huh.  
That's definitely a possibility.  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Andersen:**   
At any rate...this is also our best chance to take these things down for good. Master!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go get them!  
   
**Andersen:**   
Too late! We're under attack right now!  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Put up your guard)  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Huh? What's going on?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
A battle! Master's already spotted them!  
Now get ready to fight, quickly!  
  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm seeing more magical energy...no, Cursed Book Signals! A small group from the archive is headed your way!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Kyaah!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Then I shall meet them on the field of battle! It's time to clean up this mess I made once and for all!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Andersen:**   
...It's quiet. Too quiet.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Even after all those Cursed Books flooded the halls earlier, I don't see so much as a page now. Looks like their leader knows when to reign in the troops.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Where's the entrance to this archive?  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Right over here. I usually keep it hidden with one of my spells...  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Wow! To think there was a secret passageway behind those shelves! It's like a mage's workshop, or a masked vigilante's secret base...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
It's nothing special, really. Just an ordinary archive. All I do is try to keep it from drawing attention.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...Thank you all so much for everything.  
You've been a tremendous help to me.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Now that my mess is almost cleaned up,  
I'll be doing this last part&ndash;  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
With the rest of us, of course.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nuh-uh. I'm not letting you do this alone.  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Andersen:**   
What [♂ he /♀ she] said. It's not like [♂ he's /♀ she's] got anything better to do, after all. Nor is [♂ he /♀ she] the type to give up and go home after coming this far.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
So you may as well give up and let [♂ him /♀ her] keep helping you.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
What? You still feel sorry for getting us wrapped up in all this? Well too bad.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
You're a Chaldean Heroic Spirit now, so you'd better get used to others getting in your business, whether you like it or not.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Besides, it's not like this is a Holy Grail War where lives are on the line. There's nothing wrong with a Servant leaning on their Master.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...All right.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I won't resist your efforts to help me any longer.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I would be glad to have you all accompany me to the very end...Master.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Let's go!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Okay!  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm picking up a large magical energy signal...! This is definitely the biggest Cursed Book we've seen to date!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Everyone, please be careful!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
What an enormous Japanese-style bound book... It's as though it were the king of all books, or a dragon in book form.  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Wow, it's dekahuge! Super dekahuge!  
I-I mean Mecha Eli-chan is bigger...!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
...but it's still really, really dekahuge!  
Are you sure we can fight it at human scale!?  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Great! So now we're up against a Great Cursed Book that feeds on human feelings! Can WE really bring it down? We don't exactly have any heavy hitters here!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
That's it. I'm certain this is the original Cursed Book!  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Only one thing left to do now!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Come on, everyone! Let's get it!  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou! Kyaaau!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Very well then! Let's bring this last Cursed Book to heel right now!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Andersen:**   
Now's your chance! Take it down!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Okay!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Bound as I am...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...these mourning robes are dyed but a shallow shade of gray...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...Yet there are depths where the tears have made pools on my sleeves....  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...Releasing Noble Phantasm,  
Tale of Genji, Aoi, Evil Spirit.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Cursed Book...the last, and first, of your kind...  
Return to me now.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The Cursed Book has been recovered!  
Checking its magical energy now, and...Oh!  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is great! All of the chocolate resources have been restored!  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Indeed, I can confirm as much myself.  
Everything the Cursed Book took has been returned.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Despite that woman's wailings about making a mess,  
I see no reason to be dissatisfied with these results.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Well, well. That's quite merciful for an empress so notorious for being harsh. I'd even call it sweet. Whoa.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
...If you so much as mention the word “chocolate,” little scribe, I will have your head off where you stand.  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Who, me? Don't worry. I'd never be so foolish as to say that the stronger and scarier a woman is, the more susceptible she is to sweets.  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou fou, fooou!  
  
   
**Osakabehime:**   
Phew, I'm exhausted. You must be too, Murasaki-senpai!  
Congratulations on a job well done!  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
And to you. I can't tell you all how grateful I am for your help.  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did you get your precious letter back?  
   
  
  
---  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...Oh, yes. I did indeed.  
The letter is firmly back in my possession.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Thank you, [♂ Lord /♀ Lady] Fujimaru!  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
  
   
**Narration:**   
After that...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
Valentine's Day preparations, as well as the customary chocolate gift-giving went smoothly.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
And it was not long before the newly built underground library reopened its doors.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
It would seem all is well now.  
That silly Da Vinci even said...  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
“Go ahead and make as many magical energy-replenishing chocolates as you like, just like last year! No point in leaving any spare resources behind!”  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Well, I suppose even they could use a break now and then.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
I'm so glad things turned out okay. Really.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
There doesn't seem to have been any real damage, so I'd say this was mild as far as Valentine's Day happenings go.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Do not get smart with me.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
By the way, Assassin, you wouldn't happen to know where the Holy Grails&ndash;  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
No.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...The Holy Grails&ndash;  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
Do not make me repeat myself.  
  
   
**Semiramis:**   
If you are so eager to have something, then try looking for it yourself, like what's-her-name did with the letter.  
  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Hahaha, you've got me there.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...  
...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...There you are.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
You must have been dreadfully worried when I lost that precious letter...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't had so much help finding it.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I am so deeply sorry for the trouble I caused you.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Please, don't be...  
  
   
**D：???:**  
I was there the whole time, seeing how hard you searched for it...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
Then, please...allow me to return the letter you left in my care.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I kept it in my bag after making my final corrections.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
At last...I can finally return it to you.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
...Thank you.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
I'd never written a letter before...but you showed me everything I needed to know.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
You taught me how to put my thoughts and feelings into words.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
If it hadn't been for you...I don't think I'd have ever finished it.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
So, thank you. Believe me, what happened afterwards was no trouble at all.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
That's very kind of you... But no. I will not forget how my carelessness led to this mishap.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
And I promise I will take the utmost care never to let anything like it happen again.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
So I hope I will continue to see you here at the library, as well as in my writing class.  
  
   
**D：???:**  
Of course! I'd love to join you again.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...Valentine's Day is coming up soon.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
I'm told we celebrate it by giving form and voice to the feelings we harbor every day.  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
It needn't necessarily take the form of chocolate. Whatever feelings you may have, you may write down in a letter...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...be they gratitude, or affection, or anything else you may find yourself thinking of between missions...  
  
   
**Murasaki Shikibu:**   
...I hope that letter successfully makes its way to its intended recipient.  
  
   
**Narration:**   
And after that...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
While it is not clear whether she may have done so during the sweet revelry of Valentine's Day...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
...or at some other, later point...  
  
   
**Narration:**   
A young girl may just have found the courage to give a letter of her own to a certain someone...  
  
   
**Mash:**   
G-good morning, Senpai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I, uh... I have something for you...
