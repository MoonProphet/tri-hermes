# Christmas 2021: Nightingale's Christmas Carol  
  
## Prologue/Broken Present  
  
**Narration:**   
The snow falls silently, covering everything in a soft, white blanket.  
  
**Narration:**   
I exhale and watch my breath transform into white mist.  
  
**Narration:**   
My hands are numb from the cold, and the freezing wind relentlessly slices through any opening it can find in my clothing.  
  
**Narration:**   
In solitude, I turn my gaze up  
towards the snowy gray sky.  
  
**???:**  
You're here again, huh?  
You really don't have any friends, do you?  
  
**???:**  
So, what do you say?  
Are you ready to celebrate ▂▂▃▃▄▄▅▅?  
  
**Narration:**   
I tilt my head to the side, unsure how to respond.  
  
**Narration:**   
What is Christmas, anyway?  
  
**???:**  
Normally, you not knowing wouldn't be a problem.  
  
**???:**  
But now that you've been chosen,  
you need to think long and hard about it.  
  
**???:**  
Anything less would just be cruel to her.  
  
**Narration:**   
“Her”? Who are you talking about?  
  
**Narration:**   
But before my lips could form the question,  
she disappeared into the whirlwind of snow.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jingle bells, jingle bells♪  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's the most wonderful tiiime of the year♪  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm glad to see you're in good spirits, Senpai.  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou fou fou...  
Fou?  
  
**Mash:**   
And not just you.  
Everyone in Chaldea seems to be in a terrific mood.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh man, there's so much to do, and so little time!  
  
**Inshun:**   
Hahaha. You know, in my home country of Japan, December is known as “Shiwasu” and is written with the characters for “teacher” and “run.”  
  
**Inshun:**   
I am told that is because it is a season where mentor monks like myself tend to be running around frantically.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh yeah? Then how about keeping the tradition alive and lending me a hand.  
  
**Inshun:**   
Indeed. I would be happy to assist in any way I can.  
  
**Inshun:**   
That said, I am but a Servant and I doubt there is much I can do besides carry heavy objects.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Fine with me. That'll still be plenty of help.  
  
**Mash:**   
Don't forget us, Da Vinci.  
Senpai and I would also be glad to help out&ndash;  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
No, that's okay. Christmas is just around the corner,  
so all I want you two to do is remain on standby.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
We all know there's no telling what could happen around Christmas here!  
  
**Mash:**   
Look, Senpai! What an enormous, yummy-looking cake!  
  
**Boudica:**   
Oh no, you don't. It's still not done yet. That goes for you too, Fou. No sneaking a bite on my watch!  
  
**Fou:**   
Fooou.  
  
**Boudica:**   
After all, Christmas is coming up very soon, right?  
Oh, that reminds me.  
  
**Boudica:**   
There's one thing I wanted to talk to you about.  
  
**Boudica:**   
We don't have a Santa.  
  
**Mash:**   
I see...  
  
**Mash:**   
And by Santa, I assume you mean one of the numerous Santa Servants we've had over the years?  
  
**Boudica:**   
That's right.  
  
**Boudica:**   
Usually, by this point, we'd have a new Santa saving up magical energy for presents...  
  
**Boudica:**   
...or the Santa from last year would already be on the lookout for a new one.  
  
**Mash:**   
That's true...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Now she mentions it...I think she might be right!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Now that you mention it, I don't think I'veseen Nursery Rhyme or her friends either.  
  
---  
  
**G：Da Vinci:**   
Hello? Do you guys have a minute?  
  
**G：Da Vinci:**   
It looks like my suspicions were right on the money. We've got a new minute Singularity, and I don't mean in the seconds or hours sense.  
  
**Boudica:**   
So we've got an emergency?  
Then I guess I'd better get ready for comba&ndash;  
  
**???:**  
Ooh, there you are!  
Hiya, Boudica!  
  
**Boudica:**   
Hm? That voice...Huh?  
  
**???:**  
Here I go! Kapween!  
  
**Boudica:**   
Wha? Huh!? What's this light&ndash;Aaah!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
So, here's the location of our latest Singularity.  
  
**Mash:**   
...I'm sorry, where is it?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Exactly. We haven't been able to pin it down.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I do think it's around the year...2017? And it also looks to have weather pretty close to your average winter.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I was hoping you could put on your snowsuit and go check it out pronto...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...but the problem is, there's something strange about it.  
  
**Mash:**   
How so?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
All the Servants who were stationed here at Chaldea are already there, or on their way.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Don't worry about how they all  
managed to Rayshift for now!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
The point is, after they Rayshifted there...they all started fighting.  
  
**Mash:**   
Wha&ndash;  
  
**Mash:**   
Th-that sounds horrible!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wh-what're we gonna do!?  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Whoa now, take it easy.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
They might all be fighting, but so far,  
there's been nothing lethal.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
They've all been stopping before anyone's Spirit Origin disappears, so at least for now, we're still at zero casualties.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
That said, having Servants fight among themselves is still a big problem.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Throw in all the Rogue Servants who've been summoned there too, and it's clear we need to do something about it ASAP.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I was going to call on a Santa Servant to help out, since they're naturally a good fit for winter, but&ndash;  
  
**Mash:**   
They've all Rayshifted there too, haven't they?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Yep.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
For the moment, I guess we can put out a call to all the Servants who are still here, then&ndash;  
  
**???:**  
One moment.  
  
**???:**  
If I understand you correctly...  
  
**???:**  
...a large number of patients is awaiting aid at this Rayshift destination.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That voice...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Nightingale!  
  
**Nightingale:**   
It is my duty to help the injured,  
wherever they may be.  
  
**Nightingale:**   
Very well then...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Let us be on our way, Master.  
  
**Mash:**   
...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Uhh...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nightingale?  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Yes, I am Florence Nightingale.  
  
**Mash:**   
W-well, we already knew that!  
  
**Mash:**   
But I'm pretty sure that isn't your usual outfit!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Oh, this?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
No, I suppose not.  
I am uncertain when my wardrobe change occurred.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
But no matter. My combat style may be different now,  
but I am still me.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Please, pay it no mind.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Easier said than done.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
See, I'm pretty sure that's a Santa Claus outfit...  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Hm?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I don't understand.  
Isn't Santa Claus supposed to be a jolly old man?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Yes! Yes, he is! Finally, someone addressed the elephant in the sleigh! Uh, room!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Never mind that now, though.  
That's just how things work around here.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Anyway, now that we've got a new Santa Servant,  
that makes things nice and simple.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
You're just the Servant we need to help out on  
this mission. Everyone! Get ready to Rayshift!  
  
**Mash:**   
I'll be monitoring you from here just like always, Master.  
  
**Mash:**   
I wish I could accompany you myself, but...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't worry! I'll bring you back the best Christmas present ever!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Thank you, Senpai. I can't wait!  
  
**Narration:**   
The snow falls silently, covering everything in a soft, white blanket.  
  
**Narration:**   
I exhale and watch my breath transform into white mist.  
  
**Narration:**   
My hands are numb from the cold, and the freezing wind relentlessly slices through any opening it can find in my clothing.  
  
**Narration:**   
In solitude, I turn my gaze up  
towards the snowy gray sky.  
  
**???:**  
You're here again, huh?  
You really don't have any friends, do you?  
  
**???:**  
So, what do you say?  
Are you ready to celebrate ▂▂▃▃▄▄▅▅?  
  
**Narration:**   
I tilt my head to the side, unsure how to respond.  
  
**Narration:**   
What is Christmas, anyway?  
  
**???:**  
Normally, you not knowing wouldn't be a problem.  
  
**???:**  
But now that you've been chosen,  
you need to think long and hard about it.  
  
**???:**  
Anything less would just be cruel to her.  
  
**Narration:**   
“Her”? Who are you talking about?  
  
**Narration:**   
But before my lips could form the question,  
she disappeared into the whirlwind of snow.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jingle bells, jingle bells♪  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's the most wonderful tiiime of the year♪  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm glad to see you're in good spirits, Senpai.  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou fou fou...  
Fou?  
  
**Mash:**   
And not just you.  
All of the Servants seem to be in a terrific mood.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh man, there's so much to do, and so little time!  
  
**Inshun:**   
Hahaha. You know, in my home country of Japan, December is known as “Shiwasu” and is written with the characters for “teacher” and “run.”  
  
**Inshun:**   
I am told that is because it is a season where mentor monks like myself tend to be running around frantically.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh? Interesting turn of phrase.  
Does that mean you're going to lend a hand?  
  
**Inshun:**   
Indeed. I would be happy to assist in any way I can.  
  
**Inshun:**   
That said, I am but a Servant and I doubt there is much I can do besides carry heavy objects.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey, that's plenty! Pretty much seventy percent of the end-of-year cleanup is just manual labor, after all.  
  
**Mash:**   
Don't forget us, Da Vinci.  
Senpai and I would also be glad to help out&ndash;  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh no you don't. You two stay on standby.  
Christmas is just around the corner, right?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
And I've seen enough in the database to have a pretty good idea of just how crazy Christmas at Chaldea gets.  
  
**Mash:**   
Captain also certainly seems  
to have a lot on his plate...  
  
**Goredolf:**   
You two. What are you looking so giddy about?  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Can't you see that everyone's busy getting ready to deal with the Lostbelts?  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Get back to your standby positions at once. This is no time to be sitting around twiddling our thumbs.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You don't say.  
  
**Mash:**   
I suppose you're right.  
  
**Mash:**   
By the way, Director Goredolf,  
may I ask you where you got that cake?  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What about sitting around with a literal piece of cake?  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou fou fou!  
  
**Mash:**   
Ah! Fou is taking strong issue with that proposed course of action!  
  
---  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Hm? You've got it all wrong, you little bacon thief. My snack here is all part of my emergency preparation regimen.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Thanks to all these bizarre little events that have been taking place on top of the already strenuous Lostbelts, my stress levels are at an all-time high.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
And considering the toll they were found to be taking on me during my last physical before this nonsense, I don't even want to think about what my next one will be like if this keeps up.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Which is why my technical advisor officially prescribed me a strict sweets quota to aid my mental health.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
If you don't believe me,  
go ahead and ask Da Vinci yourself.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Suffice to say, this cake is mine alone. And before you ask, I'll have you know there was not a single (overt) bribe involved.  
  
**Fou:**   
Fou. Fooou?   
(Sniffing for anything “under the table.”)  
  
**Mash:**   
Okay... But, um, I have to ask, Director Goredolf:  
Are you sure you're okay eating that cake?  
  
**Mash:**   
I mean, considering that there was that,  
well...poisoned cake incident...  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Oh, yes, that. Naturally, I'm still dealing with some PTSD from that unfortunate incident.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Fortunately, I oversaw every step of making this cake personally, so I have complete confidence in its safety.  
  
**Boudica:**   
Ahahahaha. I don't think I've ever baked with such an...attentive audience before.  
  
**Boudica:**   
But I'm still happy to do it. Especially if it can help you overcome your cake PTSD.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
...(Munch)...  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Ordinarily, it would be a tremendous  
waste of magical energy... (Munch)  
  
**Goredolf:**   
...to employ a Servant, who is basically like a  
familiar, for anything besides combat...(Nom nom)  
  
**Goredolf:**   
But considering how few hands we have to spare,  
as well as the need to let our staff get the rest  
they deserve...(Gulp)  
  
**Goredolf:**   
...I'm afraid I simply had no choice but to have you attend to more menial matters.  
  
**Boudica:**   
Really, it's okay. Like I said, I'm happy to do it.  
  
**Boudica:**   
Although, speaking of things one's happy to do...  
There's something I wanted to ask you about, Master.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's up?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Stare at cake)  
  
---  
  
**Goredolf:**   
...Did I not just get done telling  
you this cake is mine!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No fair!  
  
---  
  
**Goredolf:**   
All's fair in food and war!  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Besides, you don't look like you've ever been stressed out a day in your life!  
  
**Boudica:**   
Now, now, don't worry about that.  
I'll bring you some cake of your own later.  
  
**Boudica:**   
What I wanted to say was, it's getting to be that time of year, isn't it? What was it again...? Oh, right! Christmas!  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes, it is.  
  
**Mash:**   
It's been wonderful seeing all the  
Servants in such high spirits.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Is that what you call it? It all seems like a bunch of idle frivolity to me. Hmph, some heroes this lot turned out to be...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's a little hard to take you seriouslywhile you're holding that cake, Director.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Don't be ridiculous. Everyone knows a commander's penchant for tea or coffee has nothing to do with their ability to lead. Why should cake be any different?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Nom nom) All that aside, Director  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Boudica, my apologies for interrupting, but would you mind not being so quick to dole out excess calories to our resident Master!?  
  
**Boudica:**   
Oh, sorry. [♂ He /♀️ She] just looked like [♂ he /♀️ she] wanted  
it so badly. I couldn't help myself.  
  
---  
  
**Boudica:**   
Anyway, I think it's great that everyone's excited about the holidays, but there is something I found odd.  
  
**Mash:**   
Odd, you say?  
  
**Boudica:**   
We don't have a Santa.  
  
**Mash:**   
I see...  
  
**Mash:**   
And by Santa, I assume you mean one of the numerous Santa Servants we've had over the years?  
  
**Goredolf:**   
(Numerous Santas? Oh dammit.  
My mustache just lost all its luster.)  
  
**Goredolf:**   
(That's a sign of A-rank danger if ever I saw one. I'd best live up to that Phoenix nickname and fly the coop while I can.)  
  
**Boudica:**   
That's right.  
  
**Boudica:**   
Usually, by this point, we'd have a new Santa saving up magical energy for presents...  
  
**Boudica:**   
...or the Santa from last year would already be on the lookout for a new one.  
  
**Mash:**   
That's true...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Come to think of it, I haven't seen the kid Servants anywhere either.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Now that you mention it, I don't think I'veseen Nursery Rhyme or her friends either.  
  
---  
  
**G：Da Vinci:**   
Hey guys! Oh? I don't see Gordy anywhere...  
Guess he made a break for it, huh?  
  
**G：Da Vinci:**   
Oh well, never mind him. Would you guys mind coming to the Command Room? Like, right now?  
  
**G：Da Vinci:**   
We've got a minute Singularity on our hands that needs to be taken care of posthaste.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Right on schedule, huh?  
  
---  
  
**G：Da Vinci:**   
You know it!  
  
**Boudica:**   
So we've got an emergency?  
Then I guess I'd better get ready for comba&ndash;  
  
**???:**  
Ooh, there you are!  
Hiya, Boudica!  
  
**Boudica:**   
Hm? That voice...Huh?  
  
**???:**  
Here I go! Kapween!  
  
**Boudica:**   
Wha? Huh!? What's this light&ndash;Aaah!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Okay, so this latest Singularity is right here.  
  
**Mash:**   
Um... Here where, exactly?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, that's the thing.  
We haven't been able to pin it down.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I think it's around the year...2017? And it also looks to have weather pretty close to your average winter.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I was hoping you could put on your snowsuit and go check it out pronto...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...but the problem is,  
there's something strange about it.  
  
**Mash:**   
How so?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
All the Servants who were stationed here at the Wandering Sea are already there, or on their way.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Don't worry about how they all  
managed to Rayshift for now!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
The point is, after they Rayshifted there...they all started fighting.  
  
**Mash:**   
Really?  
  
**Mash:**   
Th-that sounds horrible!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wh-what're we gonna do!?  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Easy there. It's not as bad as it sounds.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
They might all be fighting,  
but they're not trying to kill each other.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
They've all been stopping before anyone's Spirit Origin disappears, so at least at this point, we're still at zero casualties.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
That said, having Servants fight among themselves is still really, really bad.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Throw in all the Rogue Servants who've been summoned there too, and we've got a recipe for serious potential disaster.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I was going to call on a Santa Servant to help out, since they're naturally a good fit for winter, but&ndash;  
  
**Mash:**   
They've all Rayshifted there too, haven't they?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Yep.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
For the moment, I guess we can put out a call to all the Servants who are still here, then&ndash;  
  
**???:**  
One moment.

**Nightingale:**   
It is my duty to help the injured,

**Nightingale:**   
Very well then...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Let us be on our way, Master.  
  
**Mash:**   
...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Uhh...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nightingale?  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Yes, I am Florence Nightingale.  
  
**Mash:**   
W-well, we already knew that!  
  
**Mash:**   
But I'm pretty sure that isn't your usual outfit!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Oh, this?

Easier said than done.

**Fujimaru 2:**   
See, I'm pretty sure that's a Santa Claus outfit...  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Hm?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I don't understand.  
Isn't Santa Claus supposed to be a jolly old man?  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Yes! Yes, he is! Finally, someone addressed the elephant in the sleigh! Uh, room!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Never mind that now, though.  
That's just how things work around here.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Anyway, now that we've got a new Santa Servant,  
that makes things nice and simple.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
You're just the Servant we need to help out on  
this mission. Everyone! Get ready to Rayshift!  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Unfortunately, Sion and the rest of the staff have their hands full with the Lostbelt situation...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
...so I'd like you to back Master up from here.  
Can you do that, Mash?  
  
**Mash:**   
Yes, of course.  
That was my job back in Chaldea too, after all.  
  
**Mash:**   
Master, it looks like I'll be handling your existence verification this time.  
  
**Mash:**   
I wish I could accompany you myself, but I guess that's just not in the cards this time...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't worry! I'll bring you back the best Christmas present ever!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Thank you, Senpai. I can't wait!  
  
## Section 1: Santa Claus Noir  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
A snowy field like this is no place for people to spend long periods of time.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
How is your snowsuit working, Master?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All good here.  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I'm afraid that's not good enough. Here, I want you to wear this ski mask, goggles, and hat as well.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
You have your pocket warmers, yes?  
You'll also need some warm food...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
And here's a scarf to keep your neck safe from the elements too.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh, thanks...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
I can barely see you underneath  
all that snow gear now...  
  
**Goredolf:**   
(I see this Servant is something of a worrywart...)  
  
**Goredolf:**   
(But, that should make her a good fit for  
Fujimaru under these circumstances.)  
  
**Mash:**   
Ahem.  
  
**Mash:**   
Master, I'm picking up some Servant readings just ahead of your position.  
  
**Mash:**   
They don't seem to be fighting right now.  
Why don't you see if they're willing to talk?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sounds good!  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Man, this blizzard's really picking up...  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Hold it, Master. I can see a faint light over there.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
It could be one of the Servants Mash picked up.  
Let's go investigate.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Right on!  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
...  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hey, Santa, do a trick or something.  
I'm getting bored outta my skull here.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Santa does not do tricks. Her job is to fly around with a jet engine throwing presents at good little boys and girls.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
If a trick is what you desire, then amuse yourself.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
What do you think he is?  
Can't you see how brilliant those flames are?  
  
**Darius III:**   
...  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
I hardly think lighting a candle qualifies as a brilliant flame.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Okay, I know this is filthy rich coming from me,  
but you treat him like shit. You know that, right?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So that's who was casting that light.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Looks like it was Darius III who lit our way.  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
What do you want, Master?  
In fact, what're you even doing he&ndash;  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Well now, aren't you two an unhealthy looking couple.  
  
**Both:**   
...!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
You should stop burning the lamp oil&ndash;or the candle wicks, as the case may be&ndash;and return to Chaldea at once.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Yeah, I guess you're right.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Much as I'd love to do just that,  
I'm afraid there's just ooone little problem.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
In that, we agree. I never expected you would also be a Santa, Nightingale.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
What do you mean?  
I'm Florence Nightingale, not Santa Claus.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Yeah, don't care.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Now hand over those Santa Resources  
if you know what's good for you!  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I need them to get even more Santa Power!  
  
**Darius III:**   
Santa!!!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Now I see.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
First you call me Santa, and now you're spouting delusions about Santa Power... You're clearly suffering from derangement.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Fortunately, I have ampoules full of sedative right here with me.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
But I will need your orders to  
help administer them, Master.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Seeing as they are all soldiers, I doubt I will be able to treat them without first subduing them in combat.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I-I guess we're doing this then!  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Indeed, we are! Now, to battle!  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Yeow! Ow ow ow ow! No more needles!  
They sting like crazy!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
No, they don't. You only think they do.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You think I don't know my own pain receptors!?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Those sedatives are meant for soldiers.  
You felt nothing.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
What do you think those soldiers are gonna feel when you pump them full of those things? A world of pain, that's what!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Hmm. I hadn't thought of it like that before.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
...Well now.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
It would seem the fog clouding your mind has cleared up considerably, Jeanne Claus.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Perhaps those ampoules contained just  
the medicine you needed after all.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I told you, you were sick.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What in the world is going on?  
  
---  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
A fair question.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Very well then, allow me to explain while Little Miss Dragon Maiden continues crying over her shots.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hey! I'm not crying! You're crying!  
Don't look at me, dumbass!  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
First, let me tell you where we are.  
This place is known as...  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Santa Island.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Yes. Santa Island.  
  
**Mash:**   
Santa Island...!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Now where have I heard that name before?  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Hehehe... Don't look at me.  
I had nothing to do with this!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Santa Island, huh?  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Correct. Santa Island.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm. Santa Island, Santa Island...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
I've heard of an island called Santa Cruz, but I'm not seeing anything in the database about a Santa Island...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
So what IS Santa Island?  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
All you need to understand is that it is an island of Santas, by Santas, and for Santas.  
  
---  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
To be perfectly blunt, the weeping dragon maiden there was brainwashed.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
I was only here because I found her amusing to watch.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did you say brainwashed!?  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Then, are all these fights to the death taking place here a result of this brainwashing?  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
No.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
The term “brainwashing” may sound alarming,  
but its effects are minimal.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
All it does...  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
...is make the brainwashee fervently believe that they must become Santa, or that they already are Santa.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Nothing more.  
  
**Mash:**   
...  
  
**Mash:**   
That, uh, sounds pretty bad to me...  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I'll say.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hell, I've already got a sis&ndash;I mean,  
a Lily version of me running around as a Santa.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
So why do I gotta get wrapped  
up in this Santa bullshit too!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Be patient! We only just got here!  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
How did things come to this in the first place?  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
I am afraid I do not know that either. I have  
forgotten everything I knew about that crucial aspect.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I don't remember a damn thing either.  
Actually, there might be one thing.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I think I remember meeting  
someone before this went down.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Someone like...?  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
How can I put this...?  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Some insufferably bright, cheery sort.  
Kinda my opposite, really.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
They also seemed like someone my whole bloodline has some really bad history with.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
There was something about their very existence that made me want to just pinch their cheeks and keep twisting them farther than they should go...  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
So yeah, someone like that.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I have no clue who you could be talking about.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think I might have an idea of who you're talking about...  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Well, that's all the hints you're getting from me.  
Ugh, this sucks.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I'm freaking exhausted.  
  
**Darius III:**   
(Nodding wordlessly)  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Well? Aren't you gonna offer to  
let me rest my head in your lap?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
With all your spiky armor from head to toe!?  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
And I should care what happens to your legs because...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(That seems like it'd be really painful...)  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Why're you looking at me like that?  
Just hurry up and let me lie down already!  
  
---  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Really???  
Those are the only hints I've got, you know?  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Anyway, whoever the bastard is that brainwashed me, just point me in their direction, so I can roast their ass.  
  
**Mash:**   
Um, Jeanne Alter?  
  
**Mash:**   
There are no hostile entities nearby, so I don't think you need to be that close to Master...  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
What was that?  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Who cares? It's not like I'm gonna  
eat [♂ him /♀️ her] alive or something.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
You aren't?  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Of course not!  
The hell do you think I am!?  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
A man-eater.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Ugh, do you ever freakin' shut up!?  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
This is exactly what I hate about Santas!  
They all suck!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Absolutely.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Oh?  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Wait, what?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Indeed, I couldn't agree more.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Sneaking into houses in the dead of night and giving children so-called candy in the form of sugary lumps?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
By increasing tooth decay,  
he's doing the devil's own work.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Uh, yeah, that's not what I'm talking about.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I mean, come on, you're technically a Santa yourself now, right?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Huh?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
You think I'm Santa Claus?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
You know, Master told me something similar, but I just don't see it. What makes you think I'm Santa?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I'm just a nurse making house calls in a slightly reddish outfit.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Oh yeah? Then what about those Christmasy bells on your nursing kit?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Oh... When did those get there?  
I didn't even notice.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
My point is, if they're there now,  
there's gotta be a reason for it.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Regardless, whether you accept the truth about your Santa status or not...  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
...Santa Island is still overrun with Servants who all claim to be the one true Santa.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
So as long as you have those Santaesque bells,  
you are going to end up a target.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Oh? Well, if Santa Claus wants to stop giving children cavities in order to come after me...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...I would be more than happy to face him and bring him to account for his crimes.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hoo boy...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
What are we going to do about this, Master?  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm not sure how we can get on the same page about Santa Claus when her conception of him is so different from ours...  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
For now, I don't want to do anything that might demotivate her if we don't have to, so let's see how this plays out.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Okay, I've figured out where  
the next group of Servants is.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
It looks like they're already fighting, so you'd better hurry if you want to stop them.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Come on, Nightingale!  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Very well.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I'm glad to see we both wish to see a swift end  
to meaningless conflict. Nightingale, away!  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Waugh!  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Hmph, she nearly bowled us over.  
Although, there is something off about her...  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
I have no doubt that she's got Santa Claus traits...  
but it feels like she is still missing something.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Like what?  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
If I knew what it was, I would have already said so.  
Hmm... This bears further observation.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Come, Llamrei Mark II! After them!  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hey, what about me!? Don't leave me behind, dammit!  
  
**Darius III:**   
...  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Huh? What's with the thumb?  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...You want me to get on your elephant!?  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hell yeah! That sounds awesome!  
C'mon, let's go already!  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Yeow! Ow ow ow ow! No more needles!  
They sting like crazy!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
No, they don't. You only think they do.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You think I don't know my own pain receptors!?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Those sedatives are meant for soldiers.  
You felt nothing.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**

**Nightingale Santa:**   
Hmm. I hadn't thought of it like that before.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
...Well now.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
It would seem the fog clouding your mind has cleared up considerably, Jeanne Claus.  
  
**Santa Alter:**

**Fujimaru 2:**   
Santa Island, huh?  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Correct. Santa Island.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Welp, looks like it's time for  
my headache and ulcer medicine.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Hello, Paracelsus? This is the Command Room.  
Could you bring me the usual? Much obliged.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
You've really gotten used to life  
around here, haven't you, Gordy?  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Of course I haven't. Why do you think I need the medicine!?  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Dammit, I didn't want to have to ask this, but will someone tell me what in the world Santa Island is already!?  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
All you need to understand is that it is an island of Santas, by Santas, and for Santas.

Wait, what?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Indeed, I couldn't agree more.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Sneaking into houses in the dead of night and giving children so-called candy in the form of sugary lumps?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
By increasing tooth decay,  
he's doing the devil's own work.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Uh, yeah, that's not what I'm talking about.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I mean, come on, you're technically a Santa yourself now, right?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Huh?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
You think I'm Santa Claus?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
You know, Master told me something similar, but I just don't see it. What makes you think I'm Santa?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I'm just a nurse making house calls in a slightly reddish outfit.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Oh yeah? Then what about those Christmasy bells on your nursing kit?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Oh... When did those get there?  
I didn't even notice.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
My point is, if they're there now,  
there's gotta be a reason for it.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Regardless, whether you accept the truth about your Santa status or not...  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
...Santa Island is still overrun with Servants who all claim to be the one true Santa.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
So as long as you have those Santaesque bells,  
you are going to end up a target.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Oh? Well, if Santa Claus wants to stop giving children cavities in order to come after me...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...I would be more than happy to face him and bring him to account for his crimes.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hoo boy...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
What are we going to do about this, Master?  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm not sure how we can get on the same page about Santa Claus when her conception of him is so different from ours...  
  
**Goredolf:**   
And if we play our cards poorly, we could end up dramatically demotivating her.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Why don't we wait and see how this plays out for the time being? (Besides, I'd hate to lose one of the few Servants who takes their duties seriously.)  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Good point. If we messed this up, Gordy'd be the first in line to be the next Santa.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What're you gonna bring me for Christmas, Gordy Claus?  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Nothing!  
  
**Goredolf:**   
The only thing I could even give out for the holidays is handmade stollen fruit bread!  
  
**Mash:**   
Oh wow, I didn't know you made stollen.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Well of course. It's a German Christmas tradition, after all.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Director Goredolf Claus!  
  
**Goredolf:**   
What!? No! Forget it! If you want a gift from Santa that badly, you can go to Helsinki International Airport and buy one yourself!  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Personally, I don't believe you can go wrong with anything from the Mooomiiin shop.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Once those delightful trolls grab hold of your heart, they'll never let it go.  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Okay, I've figured out where  
the next group of Servants is.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
It looks like they're already fighting, so you'd better hurry if you want to stop them.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Come on, Nightingale!  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Very well.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I'm glad to see we both wish to see a swift end  
to meaningless conflict. Nightingale, away!  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Waugh!  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Hmph, she nearly bowled us over.  
Although, there is something off about her...  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
I have no doubt that she's got Santa Claus traits...  
but it feels like she is still missing something.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Like what?  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
If I knew what it was, I would have already said so.  
Hmm... This bears further observation.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Come, Llamrei Mark II! After them!  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hey, what about me!? Don't leave me behind, dammit!  
  
**Darius III:**   
...  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Huh? What's with the thumb?  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...You want me to get on your elephant!?  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hell yeah! That sounds awesome!  
C'mon, let's go already!  
  
## Section 2: Showdown! Guardians VS Children  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I can see the battle has already begun. We'll need to  
head there straight away if we're going to stop it.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Oh, maybe I could ring these bells to let them know we're coming. I only hope they notice.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Take this!  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
And this!  
  
**Jack:**   
And some of this!  
  
**Emiya:**   
Hrn!  
  
**Boudica:**   
Yah!  
  
**Atalante Alter:**   
F-forgive me!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Oh for goodness' sake!  
Why can't you just leave us be!?  
  
**Jack:**   
Yeah! What's the big deal about a few snacks!?  
  
**Emiya:**   
That's true. There's nothing wrong with having snacks.  
  
**Emiya:**   
As long as you don't have them right before dinner!  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Ulp. I-I guess you have a point, but...  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Hey! No going goody-goody on us, Jeanne!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
We're all in this together, remember?  
There's no turning back now!  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
B-but I AM a good girl!  
  
**Jack:**   
But you also like having snacks before dinner, right?  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Yes. I can't give those up...  
  
**Atalante Alter:**   
I truly am sorry about this, but I cannot let you snack before dinner. It will stunt your growth!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Even though we're Servants?  
  
**Emiya:**   
As long as you all present yourselves as children, we have a duty as grown-ups to provide you with structure.  
  
**Emiya:**   
After all, we're&ndash;  
  
**Boudica:**   
Santa Claus!  
  
**Atalante Alter:**   
There you have it.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Stop it, stop it, stop it!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Santa can't be a parental guardian!  
You'll break the heart of every child in the world!  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Yeah!  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I actually AM a Santa! So I won't tolemerate any fake Santa who tries to destroy the Santa dream like that!  
  
**Jack:**   
Come on, let's get 'em!  
  
**Atalante Alter:**   
Curses! I did not want to have to do this, but it seems we have no choice but to ply them with presents!  
  
**???:**  
Hold it right there!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
There is nothing more tragic than parental  
guardians waging war with their children.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Now, let's all calm down and see if we can't resolve this peacefully.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...  
  
**Emiya:**   
...  
  
**All:**   
It's Santa Claus!!!  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
The way you floated down on your umbrella was just beautiful!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
How romantic! How fantastic! How artistic!  
  
**Jack:**   
You're like that Poppins lady!  
  
**Emiya:**   
Hmm. It looks like her Santa  
Resources are in those bells.  
  
**Boudica:**   
I could swear I've seen those bells somewhere before, but I can't put my finger on where...  
  
**Atalante Alter:**   
Never mind that! Let us take them for ourselves and supercharge our Santa Power!  
  
**Atalante Alter:**   
Then we can deliver presents  
to every child in the world!  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Nnn. That outfit... That color scheme...  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
She's definitely this year's Santa Claus...  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Wait! Don't be fooled!  
Take a closer look at her umbrella!  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Huh? Her umbrella?  
  
**Jack:**   
...  
  
**All Three:**   
It's a needle!!!  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Sh-she almost fooled me!  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
There's nothing worse in the whole world than giving children shots!  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
So anyone who would carry around a giant needle like that could never be Santa Claus!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...First, I never claimed to be Santa Claus. Second, shots are essential for staying in good health.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I am willing to administer as many  
as it takes to keep you all healthy.  
  
**Jack:**   
Nooo!  
  
**Jack:**   
We don't wanna get a shot! We'll be fine without it!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Hmm. It seems resolving this peacefully may be more difficult than I thought.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Master, would it be all right with you if I neutralize them first?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
And by neutralize, you mean...?  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Fight them.  
  
**Children:**   
Bring it!  
  
**Guardians:**   
You're on!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why're they all ganging up on us!?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
This is all part and parcel of administering vaccines. First, we start by properly disinfecting the patient!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I never knew Santa had so many enemies!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
How many times must I say it?  
I'm an ordinary nurse, not Santa Claus.  
  
**Mash:**   
I think we have very different definitions of “ordinary,” but never mind that now! Prepare for battle, Master!  
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Emiya:**   
Hey, so, now that that's all over with...  
  
**Emiya:**   
...do you think you could chalk this up to a bad dream and just forget it ever happened?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't know. It was pretty unforgettable...  
  
**Emiya:**   
Well do your best! I'm begging you here!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Forget what ever happened?  
  
**Emiya:**   
Exactly! Thanks for understanding, Master!  
  
---  
  
**Boudica:**   
Phew. Thanks for snapping us out of that.  
  
**Atalante Alter:**   
Why in the world was I set on becoming Santa Claus?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
You were sick. Confused. Not in your right minds.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
You were all suffering from...let's call it  
“Santa Claus Syndrome” for the time being.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay, but how did that happen?  
  
---  
  
**Emiya:**   
I don't know. I'm pretty sure I was cooking before this all went down, but that's all I know.  
  
**Boudica:**   
Me too. Though I also get the feeling that someone  
told me I was going to become Santa Claus.  
  
**Atalante Alter:**   
Same.  
  
**Atalante Alter:**   
Oh, I just remembered something else. I also heard a jingling sound, just like the one coming from those.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You mean these bells?  
  
---  
  
**Emiya:**   
That's right. I remember someone said something like:  
  
**Emiya:**   
“You can be Santa too!”  
  
**Emiya:**   
Once the bells started ringing,  
I gradually lost consciousness...  
  
**Emiya:**   
...and the next thing I knew, I was Santa.  
Well, trying to become Santa, anyway.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That sounds like something out of a horror movie.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Indeed, what a horrifying scenario.  
I didn't know Santa was contagious...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Just to be sure, you didn't do this, right, Nightingale?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I did not.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
That said...I also don't remember when or how I acquired this new outfit.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I think I may have been talking to someone right beforehand, but I don't know who it could have been.  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
What about you? What are you three doing here?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
We came to tour Santa Island!  
  
**Jack:**   
Yeah! There were some posters on the wall that said, “You can be Santa too!”  
  
**Mash:**   
Master.  
  
**Mash:**   
I found the posters in question. It wasn't hard; whoever put them up wasn't shy about using any available surface.  
  
**Emiya:**   
Now I remember.  
  
**Emiya:**   
I saw that same Santa slogan, got a bad feeling about it, and promptly chose to ignore it.  
  
**Emiya:**   
That's when it happened.  
Somebody came up to me and said...  
  
**Emiya:**   
“How could you just ignore it? That's so mean!”  
  
**Emiya:**   
And you know the rest.  
  
**Boudica:**   
Right. I remember they sounded kind of...girlish and not girlish at the same time?  
  
**Boudica:**   
They had a cute voice.  
At least, I think they did...  
  
**Atalante Alter:**   
I can say this much for sure:  
whoever did this was not a child.  
  
**Atalante Alter:**   
I also take issue with Boudica's use of “cute.”  
  
**Atalante Alter:**   
This person's voice was cute, yes, but I feel like there was also something distinctly...uncute about it.  
  
**Boudica:**   
Aww, come on! It was totally cute!  
  
**Emiya:**   
I'm...not sure what to make of it.  
  
**Emiya:**   
I think it did sound cute, but it also sounded like the voice of a born troublemaker.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
(What is this? Ethereal profiling?)  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
What about you, um, Nightingale?  
Do you still insist you're not Santa Claus?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Obviously.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Santa is a demon who goes around giving out candy in the dead of night. He is the enemy of children and dentists everywhere.  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
That's so far off the mark I don't  
even know where to begin!  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Santa Claus isn't a demon at all! He's...um...  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Reindeer! How would you describe Santa?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's hard to put into words...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I guess I'd say Santa gives people hopes and dreams?  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
It IS hard to put into words, isn't it?  
In the end, it all comes down to feeling!  
  
**Jack:**   
Yeah. It's like how we just know when we have the perfect chance to kill somebody.  
  
**Jack:**   
We'd guess any Assassin probably  
knows what that's like.  
  
**Emiya:**   
Hmm.  
  
**Emiya:**   
That sounds like the unconscious feeling I get when I can just tell my next arrow is going to hit its target.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
That's how I know you must be Santa Claus!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
But you still can't accept who you are.  
That's so sad!  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Yes, it is. If you ask me, being Santa Claus is the greatest job in the world.  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Trust me! Getting to be Santa is a biiig honor and you should be proud!  
  
**Jack:**   
Yay, presents♪  
We wonder what we're gonna get this year♪  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...What is it you three want for Christmas?  
Is it sweets?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Sweets would be great, of course, but really,  
we'd be happy with anything.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
After all, presents are the stuff of love,  
hopes, and dreams!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Love, hopes, and dreams, huh?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Those are all very important. But presents are supposed to be strictly material things, correct?  
  
**Emiya:**   
You're not wrong. Kids do love getting practical gifts.  
  
**Emiya:**   
It's a conundrum every parental  
figure has to deal with.  
  
**Boudica:**   
You think? I've always believed it's the thought that counts when it comes to gifts.  
  
**Boudica:**   
That holds true whether those thoughts are affectionate or spiteful.  
  
**Atalante Alter:**   
I do not think I want to imagine  
a present given out of spite.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...I see.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
So what you're saying is, there's more to the Santa Claus class than going around giving candy to children.  
  
**Emiya:**   
That's right. A lot more.  
  
**Emiya:**   
...Wait a second. Are you uncomfortable around kids?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Are you?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...A moment, please.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I assure you, I do not dislike or otherwise shun children. I have no negative feelings whatsoever toward them.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
However... Um...  
  
**Emiya:**   
I get it. Some feelings, you just can't put into words.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...  
  
**Boudica:**   
Anyway, now that we've snapped out of it, we should really get back and start getting ready for Christmas.  
  
**Emiya:**   
Sounds good to me.  
  
**Emiya:**   
How about you three? You can stay and continue your tour if you want, but it could get a little dangerous.  
  
**Jack:**   
We wanna go home too!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I agree. Every child has the right to wait patiently for presents, whether they're naughty or nice.  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I don't know.  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
I was hoping to find Santa Island Mask here, since this place is called Santa Island and all...  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
But I guess going back home works too!  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Hey, if you two run into a man with a mask, please tell him I'm doing well!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I still don't believe I'm the next Santa Claus&ndash;or at least, I don't think so&ndash;but all right, I will.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Okay Master, now that we've successfully eradicated the disease here, let's go look for the next group of patients.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh... You mean with that umbrella?  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Yes, why not? If you like, I would be glad to transport you on my umbrella.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Just make sure you hold on to me tight.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Oh! Wait, Florence.  
There's one last thing I want to ask you.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
“Florence”?  
Very well. What is it?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Would you be so kind as to tell me how you feel about children some time?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I am a hero of children everywhere, after all!  
  
**Boudica:**   
Hey, Jeanne? Are you sure she's this year's Santa?  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Absolutely!  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
As the last-last-last Santa Claus myself, I can spot another Santa with one-hundred-percent certainty!  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
So I can tell you for sure that Nightingale is this year's Santa!  
  
**Emiya:**   
Looks like she still hasn't come to terms with it, though.  
  
**Atalante Alter:**   
Maybe not, but it also seems that your words had an effect on her.  
  
**Emiya:**   
Well, I don't know about that.  
  
**Emiya:**   
She's a smart lady. I'm sure she would've figured it out on her own at some point.  
  
**Emiya:**   
...Hm?  
  
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**   
Ooh! That's the Santa who came before me!  
  
**Boudica:**   
Followed closely by a war elephant...  
  
**Atalante Alter:**   
If I did not know better,  
I would have thought I was at a zoo.  
  
**Emiya:**   
(No kidding. Especially with that Demon Boar on your shoulder...)  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Okay, everyone, let's go back to Chaldea!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
We have to get ready to welcome our new Santa Claus!  
  
## Section 3: Christmas Present  
  
**Bad Guy:**   
Mwahahaha!  
  
**Bad Guy:**   
We're gonna mess this Christmas party up real bad!  
  
**Orion:**   
Specifically, we're gonna turn the Christmas cake into a kagami mochi rice cake and the Christmas tree into a New Year's kadomatsu decoration!  
  
**Orion:**   
We're also gonna turn the hot Santa cosplayers into hot kimono babes!  
  
**Orion:**   
...On second thought, I guess it doesn't matter as long as they're hot!  
  
**???:**  
Hold it right there, dammit!  
  
**Bad Guy:**   
Who're you!?  
  
**???:**  
You wanna know who I am? Fair enough.  
My name is Aśvatthāman!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
As for what I'm doing here...  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
...I'm like a Santa Claus whose job is keeping Christmas safe.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
And you, bad guy, are about to bad DIE!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Lessee, what was my next line? Oh, right.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Suit on!!!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
I'm the ultimate warrior!  
An avatar of rage!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
And I'm gonna kill you dead!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Haaa!  
  
**Bad Guy:**   
Gaah!  
  
**Orion:**   
Curse you, Aśvatthāman!  
  
**Orion:**   
Gaah!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Huh? But I haven't even done anything yet.  
  
**Orion:**   
I'm sure...  
But that doesn't make it any less painful...  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
...Ah well, who cares!  
The important thing is, I won!  
  
**Caesar:**   
All right everyone, come and get your Aśvatthāman Transformation Kits for a whopping twenty percent off as part of our Christmas Sale Extravaganza! Offer good while supplies last!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Man, what'm I gonna do?  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
My pocket QP just isn't quite enough to cover it...  
They really know how to hit us where it hurts.  
  
**Paris:**   
(Sniff) I just know Hektor's not gonna be happy about me spending money on this sort of thing...  
  
**Paris:**   
But then again, it might be worth it if that transformation belt makes me stronger!  
  
**Caesar:**   
Of course it can make you stronger. As long as you never lose sight of your dreams, that is!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Hey, Kotarou. How's about you and me team up?  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Long as we do that, we'll be golden, baby!  
(Translation: Let's pool our allowance to buy one.)  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
Sounds good to me. All right then, let's play rock-paper-scissors to see who gets to wear it fir&ndash;  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
(Yawwwn) Glad that's over with.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
I gotta say though, this isn't how I pictured Santa Claus. Something about it just seems wrong.  
  
**Caesar:**   
Don't be silly. What could possibly be wrong?  
  
**Caesar:**   
Christmas and capitalism go together like peanut butter and mint juleps.  
  
**Caesar:**   
And by scamming&ndash;I mean, taking that opportunity to earn QP, we do our part to keep the economy turning.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
I know, you're right, but...I dunno.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
I still feel like I'm a far cry from what Santa's supposed to be.  
  
**Caesar:**   
Preposterous.  
  
**Caesar:**   
You're red, and you can transform.  
That more than qualifies you to be Santa Claus.  
  
**???:**  
Enough.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Hm?  
  
**Caesar:**   
Who goes there?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Good day, everyone. I'm&ndash;  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Santa Claus!!!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Hot damn, check out all that  
Santa Power you got going for you!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
No, I'm&ndash;  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Bad. Ass.  
That's the goldenest red Santa I've ever seen.  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
(Wait, which is it? Red or golden?)  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
All right, I've made up my mind!  
I'm gonna root for Aśvatthāman!  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
Then I'll root for this new Santa!  
Not for any particular reason, mind you.  
  
**Paris:**   
Aw man, which one should I root for?  
They're both really awesome...  
  
**Paris:**   
...but I think I've got to go with Aśvatthāman!  
  
**Paris:**   
(Especially since her umbrella's actually a big syringe!  
No way would I want her sticking me with that!)  
  
**Caesar:**   
Hmm. Unexpected intruders though you may be, it seems we are obligated to welcome you as a fellow Santa Claus.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Then you all claim to be Santa Claus as well?  
  
**Caesar:**   
Absolutely! We are all Santa Claus here!  
  
**Caesar:**   
We will grow the economy by delivering hopes and dreams, thereby helping people around the world to lead full and happy lives!  
  
**Mash:**   
That sounds great in theory, but...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then what's that giant pile of QP behind you for?  
  
---  
  
**Caesar:**   
It's all part of our stimulus plan.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
What was it he called this again?  
...Oh, right.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
I think I heard him talking to himself about this gig being his ticket to easy money?  
  
**Caesar:**   
I'll thank you to keep that bit to yourself!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
It's too soon for me to tell whether your actions are right or wrong...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...but I do get the sense that your interpretation of Santa Claus is overly focused on the economic aspects.  
  
**Caesar:**   
I see.  
  
**Caesar:**   
Then it would seem we each walk very different paths, despite both of us being Santa Claus.  
  
**Caesar:**   
Speaking of which, am I right to assume that you are indeed Santa Claus yourself?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Well...  
You might be.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Perhaps I am the sort of Santa Claus you describe.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
My job is also to deliver hopes and dreams&ndash;things that we need to ensure tomorrow will be better than today.  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
What are you talking about?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Perhaps you know what I mean, Master? Surely you've heard me say the word dozens of times by now.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you talking about health?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you mean health?  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
That's right.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Health.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
If I am truly Santa Claus,  
then health is the only gift I will give.  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Damn, that's a good motive...  
Now I feel bad about mine.  
  
**Paris:**   
Me too.  
  
**Paris:**   
Santa Claus as the protector of health!  
What a wonderful idea!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I agree.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Specifically, I'm planning to give out medicine instead of candy.  
  
**J：All:**   
Wait, what?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
That's right. Medicine.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
But don't worry.  
This medicine will still taste perfectly sweet!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Who cares!?  
  
**Paris:**   
I-I take it all back! That's a terrible idea! Nobody would ever dream about getting medicine for a present!  
  
**Paris:**   
It doesn't matter how sweet it tastes!  
Medicine and candy are completely different things!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...  
...Really?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Is that true?  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
Unfortunately...  
I'm afraid I have to agree with them.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Do you think so too, Master?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's a real conundrum for sure, but...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well, probably most kids would rather get candy, so...  
  
---  
  
**Caesar:**   
Ah yes, the classic Santa quandary. Should a present be what the recipient wants, or something the recipient needs?  
  
**Caesar:**   
Truly a dilemma for the ages.  
  
**Caesar:**   
And you mean to tackle it head-on, do you? Hmm.  
  
**Caesar:**   
I applaud your bravery, Nightingale. The way of the Santa Claus you have chosen may be the most difficult there is.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Does that mean you think my notions  
about gift-giving are mistaken?  
  
**Caesar:**   
It doesn't matter what I think.  
Our battle will decide who's right and wrong.  
  
**Caesar:**   
Go on, Aśvatthāman!  
Take up your arms!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Hm?  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Uh, okay. I guess Santa Clause can't  
back down from a fight, huh?  
  
**Mash:**   
(Something tells me he doesn't really know what Santa Claus is about, either...)  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Very well, Mr. Caesar.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
It seems you know what lies  
beyond the way of the Santa.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
So if fighting this battle will allow me to learn that as well...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...then I am happy to accept, one Santa Claus to another!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...So, which one do we root for now?  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
G-good luck, you two! May the best Santa win!  
  
**Paris:**   
Medicine or candy... Medicine or candy... She did say the medicine would be sweet... Oh, which one's the right choice?  
  
**Paris:**   
Argh, I can't make up my mind!  
Why do I always get stuck with the hard decisions!?  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Aw crap! I ran outta Santa Power!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
...Wait. Why'd I wanna be Santa again?  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
I think that takes us more into existential questions than we really have time for...  
  
**Caesar:**   
Hahaha.  
  
**Caesar:**   
Well, that's easy enough, Aśvatthāman.  
  
**Caesar:**   
It's because I was using my own Santa Power to...encourage you towards that end.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
So you were using me? Huh!?  
Is that what you're saying?  
  
**Caesar:**   
Well, yes, I suppose you could put it that way.  
  
**Caesar:**   
But think back on your experiences, and be honest:  
Didn't you enjoy being Santa Claus?  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Hell no I...  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
...  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
You know what? I did!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Being Santa was a ton of fun!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
I especially liked how the audience got all excited whenever I transformed, though I still don't know why!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Hey, there ain't a red-blooded male around who hasn't dreamed about bein' a transformin' superhero at least once.  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...Huh? What about my Golden Huge Bear armor?  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
That is a thing, but everyone knows the big mecha is second place compared to bein' able to TRANSFORM!  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
I can technically transform, but it's not anywhere near as cool as when you do it.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Don't be so hard on yourself, Fuuma Kotarou.  
We're still us, no matter what we look like.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
So be proud of what you got, dammit!  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
O-okay!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
So what do you transform into, anyway?  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
A grotesque, red-skinned monster about two-hundred and sixteen centimeters tall.  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
I can still think when I'm in that form, but I can't pull my punches anymore since I'm basically half-mad.  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Ah, that's no problem. There were guys with transformations like that back in my day, too!  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
You don't say!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
(“No problem” my ass. If Raikou ever catches Kotarou like that, his head'll be on the floor faster than you can say “golden”...)  
  
**Caesar:**   
Well, Nightingale? Did you learn anything from our little tête-à-tête?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...No. If anything, I feel like I now  
understand Santa Claus less than ever.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Other Santas provide children with hopes,  
dreams, candy, and gifts.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
But if I were Santa Claus,  
the only thing I would offer is medicine.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I have no idea what the right answer is. I can't even see a way for me to figure out what it could be.  
  
**Caesar:**   
Ah, my dear Nightingale. It seems there is one thing you still have yet to realize.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Huh?  
  
**Caesar:**   
Let's say you come across two patients. One is suffering from external injuries, the other from pneumonia.  
  
**Caesar:**   
What would you do?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Well, first I'd determine which patient is in greater need of medical assistance...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Then I would stitch up the trauma victim's wounds or administer medicine as needed...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
......  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
!  
  
**Caesar:**   
There you go.  
  
**Caesar:**   
Just as no two patients have the same needs,  
no two children have the same wants.  
  
**Caesar:**   
As long as you understand that, I have no doubt you will go on to be an excellent Santa Claus!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Huh?  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Does that mean the person who made us all Santas isn't this year's Santa?  
  
**Caesar:**   
No, they are not. Though they do excel at enticing others towards Santadom.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hold up. There's a person turning people into Santas?  
  
---  
  
**Caesar:**   
Indeed there is.  
  
**Caesar:**   
I was under the impression that Ms. Nightingale had met with the same misfortune as us, but perhaps I was mistaken?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...Yes, you were.  
I don't recall ever meeting anyone like that.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I don't even remember when or how I became Santa Claus.  
  
**Mash:**   
So who is this person you're talking about, Caesar?  
  
**Caesar:**   
Hahaha, surely you can think of any number of individuals at Chaldea who could be responsible for a mishap like this.  
  
**Caesar:**   
...A great number, come to think of it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I wouldn't even know where to begin making up a list of suspects...  
  
---  
  
**Caesar:**   
That being said...  
  
**Caesar:**   
...I suspect you may already have a firm image of this latest caper's culprit in your head, Master.  
  
**Caesar:**   
Picture someone who loves festivals and parties... Someone who has yet to show their face in all this commotion.  
  
**Caesar:**   
Add a few more conditions to narrow it down further, and I'm confident you'll soon see what's really going on here.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see...  
  
---  
  
**Caesar:**   
All right, everyone, if you're still looking for the perfect present, the Caesar Company will be happy to assist.  
  
**Caesar:**   
And if that perfect present should be for the lad(ies) in your life, Cleopatra will get you fixed up in no time!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
By the way, there's something I've been meaning to tell you guys for a while now.  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Yeah?  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
What is it?  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
You know my name? Aśvatthāman?  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
It's not Aśvatthā Man. It's Aśvatthāman, one word.  
  
**Both:**   
IT IS!?!?!?  
  
**Fuuma Kotarou:**   
I can't believe it... All this time, we thought  
Aśvatthā stood for something really cool!  
  
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Yeah... Somethin' awesome,  
special, and golden...!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Well, sorry to disappoint. “Aśvatthāman” just means something along the lines of “horse neighing.”  
  
**Both:**   
AWESOME!  
  
**Aśvatthāman:**   
Ah, don't give me that. 'Sides, your names mean “evil wind” and “golden time,” right? That sounds pretty awesome to me!  
  
**Paris:**   
Okay! I've made my decision!  
  
**Paris:**   
I was taught long ago never to  
disobey older girls or nurses...  
  
**Paris:**   
...so since Nightingale is both,  
I have to go with her!  
  
**Paris:**   
...Huh? It's already over?  
  
**Paris:**   
Nightingale's not even here anymore?  
  
**Apollo:**   
...  
  
**Apollo:**   
You need to learn to be more decisive.  
  
**Paris:**   
...(Sniff)  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Is something wrong, [♂ Mr. /♀️ Ms.] Fujimaru?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just enjoying flying by umbrella.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...I see. I'm glad to hear that.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Still, we have been up here for quite a while now.  
Let's take a little break.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's a little scary, being up here for so long.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I see. I am sorry about that.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Since changing into this dress, whenever that happened, I have found there is something about flying by umbrella that is oddly appealing to me...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Even so, I will take us down to land.  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
......  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Master, could I talk to you about something?  
  
## Section 4: To the Distant Rainbow, Raising the Fluffy Umbrella Up  
  
**Narration:**   
I have to keep running. I have to keep running.  
  
**Narration:**   
I can feel my emotions welling up, pulling me forward like a restless child who can't wait another second.  
  
**Narration:**   
I'm going to die. I'm going to die.  
  
**Narration:**   
But it's not the physical aspect of death that scares me. It's the idea of myself, of who I am, ceasing to be...  
  
**Narration:**   
Is there anything I can do? Anything at all?  
  
**Narration:**   
What I want is to eradicate illness and injury from the world. No...I NEED to eradicate it.  
  
**Narration:**   
I'm sure that that's the whole reason I was born.  
  
**B：Girl:**   
You never look back at where you've been, do you?  
  
**Narration:**   
The voice makes me stop in my tracks.  
  
**Narration:**   
I push down my urge to turn  
around and shake my head “no.”  
  
**A：Nightingale:**   
I have neither the time nor the desire to look back.  
There is no point.  
  
**A：Nightingale:**   
Helping the sick and injured is all the happiness I need.  
  
**B：Girl:**   
If that's how you want to live your life,  
I won't try to change your mind...  
  
**B：Girl:**   
But just remember that you're going to make some people sad that way.  
  
**Narration:**   
Sad? Who? My close friends? My family?  
  
**Narration:**   
I can shrug off their sadness easily enough.  
  
**Narration:**   
That's just how I was born.  
  
**B：Girl:**   
No, no, not them. I'm talking about the child.  
  
**A：Nightingale:**   
The child!?  
  
**Narration:**   
I turn around...  
  
**Narration:**   
...and see an innocent little girl holding my hand, looking up at me with wide, sad eyes.  
  
**Narration:**   
Oh, right. Her.  
  
**Narration:**   
I sigh softly and shake off  
the child clinging to my hand.  
  
**Narration:**   
But it doesn't stop the two girls from continuing to stare at me, eyes welling with sadness.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...  
...?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I'm sorry. I must have dozed off for a minute.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is everything okay?  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Don't worry, I'm fine.  
Now, what was I saying? Oh, yes.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Most people believe that Santa Claus's origins can be traced back to Saint Nicholas.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
But some believe that Christmas was not really popularized as a holiday in England...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...until the year 1843.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Have you ever heard of Charles Dickens's novella,  
“A Christmas Carol”?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's where Ebenezer Scrooge comes from, right?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I've heard of it, but I've never read it.  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I see. Then shall I skip over its summary?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'd appreciate that, thanks.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why don't we go over it just to be sure?  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Very well.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Then as you'll recall, Scrooge has three fateful encounters that inspire him to turn over a new leaf and reconcile with his nephew and clerk...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Of course. It is a fairly old story, after all.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Very well then, here's the short and simple version.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Ebenezer Scrooge, a rich and notoriously miserly old merchant, is visited by three spirits on Christmas Eve:  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
The Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
They show him how he became so coldhearted in his past, the effects his cruel policies are having on his clerk's family in the present...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...and how the path he is on now will lead to him dying alone and unloved in the future.  
  
**Past:**   
You remember this parrot, don't you?  
This is where you were born.  
  
**Past:**   
That lonesome boy reading a book by  
the low fire over there is you.  
  
**Past:**   
Of course, at this point in your life,  
you still had hopes and dreams.  
  
**Past:**   
But over time...  
  
**Past:**   
...you changed. Oh, how you changed.  
  
**Past:**   
You made a big show about how you were no longer a child, and parted ways with the woman you loved.  
  
**Past:**   
That choice, Scrooge, has made you who you are now.  
  
**Present:**   
Your greed and cunning made you rich, but at the expense of everyone around you.  
  
**Present:**   
Your clerk is just barely scraping by thanks to your refusal to pay him a living wage.  
  
**Present:**   
He can't even afford treatment for his third son,  
Tiny Tim. But that is of little matter to you, hm?  
  
**Present:**   
If they're going to die, they had better do it,  
and ease the burden of surplus population.  
  
**Present:**   
Isn't that what you told those guys who came asking you for donations to help feed poor, hungry children?  
  
**Present:**   
Well, Uncle Scrooge?  
  
**Future:**   
(This ghost remains silent, yet its intent is clear.  
Behold your future, Scrooge.)  
  
**Future:**   
(It sneers as if to say you have no one to love,  
and no one who loves you.)  
  
**Future:**   
(Its stare causes you pain and suffering, just as you have spent your life causing pain and suffering.)  
  
**Future:**   
(It merely watches, idly, as your body is stripped of its clothing, leaving you in nothing more than threadbare underwear.)  
  
**Future:**   
(Beneath its gaze, you realize you leave nothing behind but a cold, rotting corpse.)  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
And so, Scrooge's three fateful encounters inspire him to turn over a new leaf and reconcile with his nephew and clerk.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Today, it's believed that the publication  
of “A Christmas Carol” in 1843...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...directly led to the popularization of Christmas celebrations in England as we know them today.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
The day of the Nativity is a very important one,  
both for soldiers and for myself.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I might have even celebrated it traditionally when I was still a child.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
But that all went away once  
I began living my adult life.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Truthfully, my childhood memories are so hazy that I just can't be sure if I celebrated it or not.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
The idea of an old man who embodies the holiday, whether you know him as Santa Claus or Father Christmas, hadn't yet been established in my time.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
So even though I have lived in two very different times that share Christmas as a major event...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...I still understand neither  
Christmas nor Santa Claus.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
At least, that's how it seems to me.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That doesn't change the fact that you ARE Santa Claus now.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
If you say so.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's okay. I'm sure you've figured it out.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...Thank you, Master.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Hm? Hold on. Did you say “figured it out”?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Don't you mean to say that I  
will figure it out one day?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Hmm...  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
All right, Master, let's be on our way.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I'm sure there are still other Servants out there suffering from the delusion that they should be Santa Claus...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...so we cannot rest until they have all been treated and this disturbance's mastermind is brought to light.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Oh, by the way, Master&ndash;  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I believe you have an idea of  
who the mastermind may be, yes?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Then please, tell me. Who in the world is it?  
  
**Mash:**   
I was wondering about that myself, Senpai. If we rule out Caesar, which seems like a safe bet at this point...  
  
**Mash:**   
...that leaves schemers like Professor Moriarty and troublemakers like Ishtar.  
  
**Mash:**   
But since all the usual suspects are  
confirmed to be in Chaldea right now...  
  
**Mash:**   
...then who could possibly be left?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This is only a guess on my part, but&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
Hmm. Now what am I going to do?  
  
**Narration:**   
Man, this is a real pickle.  
  
**Narration:**   
I always make it a point to help  
out people who need assistance.  
  
**Narration:**   
All the more so when they're Servants who don't usually realize they have any problems whatsoever!  
  
**Narration:**   
So I decided to try talking to her.  
  
**???:**  
Hey, come on! What's got you so down?  
  
**???:**  
Just say the word, and I'll do whatever I can to help!  
  
**Narration:**   
From there, I think it managed to work out.  
  
**Narration:**   
And not only that, I think my valiant efforts even caused my Spirit Origin to evolve!  
  
**Narration:**   
It's too bad I didn't get a swimsuit, but in some ways, this is way, way better!  
  
**???:**  
Ta-daaa! It's meee!  
Saber Astolfo!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
What's that? The greatest Saber ever? Little old me?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Aw stop, you're embarrassing me!  
(So excited he can't stand still)  
  
**Astolfo:**   
And not only that, check out my awesome sword!  
Erm, was my net always this pointy?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Aw, who cares!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Well, well. So we've got Demonic Beasts here, do we?  
Heheheh.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
My Master might be unavailable at the moment, but  
I don't need [♂ him /♀️ her] to take care of creatures  
like this anymore!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Here I gooo!  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Annnd done!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Now all I've gotta do is make her wish come true!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Who's gonna be the next Santa Claus!?  
I'm gonna find out even if it kills me!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Not that I plan on dying anytime soon, of course!  
Oh, wait. That kinda ruins what I said, huh?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
......  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Aw, it'll be fine!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
I'll just interview the new Santa once they're chosen, and if they don't cut the mustard, I'll kick 'em out and start all over again!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Santa's supposed to help make kids' dreams come true, so it had better be a Servant who's up to the task!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Oh gosh, I wonder what Master'll say.  
What if [♂ he's /♀️ she's] really proud of me?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
“I knew I could count on you!”  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Aww, stop, it was nothing.  
I can't help how awesome I am.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Ahahahaha, just kidding!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
“Who's a good Servant? You are. Yes, you are!”  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Teeheehee!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Well, I am your sword, after all! Oh man, I can't believe I finally get to say that for real!  
  
---  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Eee!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Man, Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne,  
if only you could see me now!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
I've never been cooler or more  
perfect in my entire life!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Wheee♪  
  
**Bradamante:**   
I don't like this...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
It does look like Stolfo's a lot stronger now...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
But!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Stolfo getting carried away...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
No good can come of that!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
So I'd better keep an eye on things just to make sure!  
  
## Section 5: Heading for the Girl Left Behind  
  
**Narration:**   
No sooner had my life as a nurse begun to bloom than it wilted away just as quickly.  
  
**Narration:**   
But the battle that followed it lasted for far longer.  
  
**Narration:**   
Once I was no longer able to practice medicine on the front lines, I had to keep running as fast as I could.  
  
**Narration:**   
I had no regrets about my life.  
No lingering desires for paths I did not take.  
  
**Narration:**   
No concerns or worries about the direction I was going.  
  
**Narration:**   
All I had...  
  
**Narration:**   
...was a bit of longing for the one I'd left behind.  
  
**Narration:**   
Yes... I'm afraid there's no help for her now.  
  
**Narration:**   
I abandoned the girl inside of me long ago.  
  
**Narration:**   
...I don't regret my choices. Not a one.  
  
**Narration:**   
But some did leave me with pangs in my heart...  
Pangs that feel strangely like guilt.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is this place?  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
¡Buenos días! I see you've managed to store up a great deal of Santa Power, yes!  
  
**???:**  
Indeed you have. I'm glad to see my legacy is in such good hands.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Santa Power? I still don't know what that is...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's the two last Santa Clauses!  
  
---  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Sí, Master! I'm glad to see you're in good health.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
I also see this year's Santa  
Claus is quite the character.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Not that I'm one to talk, no!  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
Ho ho ho.  
Yes, it is I, Santa.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
I must say, Chaldea's Santa Clauses certainly keep multiplying. Let's see, one...two...three...  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
If I'm not mistaken, you're the fifth one.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Hmm?  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
I take it by the look on your face that you don't remember who I am?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
No, I'm afraid I don't.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Hmm, I see.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Well, I suppose that's not too surprising, since I am partly responsible for this state of affairs, yes.  
  
**Mash:**   
Does that mean you know what's going on here, Quetzalcoatl? Because I'm still kind of lost.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
I do! Let me start at the beginning, yes!  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
You know by now that every winter, a different Chaldean Servant changes their Spirit Origin into Santa Claus, yes?  
  
**Goredolf:**   
(Santa Clauses? Plural?  
And they keep multiplying? Why? How???)  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Easy there, Gordy. Deep breaths.  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Yes, good idea.  
(Inhale...) (Exhale...) (Inhale...) (Exhale...)  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Right then! Off to bed I go.  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh no, you don't!  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Hey! Get off of me! The only thing I want to do now is hang up a stocking by my pillow and go straight to bed!  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Hmm?  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
I take it by the look on your face that you don't remember who I am?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
No, I'm afraid I don't.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Hmm, I see.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Well, I suppose that's not too surprising, since I am partly responsible for this state of affairs, yes.  
  
**Mash:**   
Does that mean you know what's going on here, Quetzalcoatl? Because I'm still kind of lost.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
I do! Let me start at the beginning, yes!  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
You know by now that every winter, a different Chaldean Servant changes their Spirit Origin into Santa Claus, yes?  
  
**Goredolf:**   
You say that as if it were no more remarkable than a dog growing out its winter coat...  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
It can happen in a number of ways. Sometimes the previous Santa will pick someone, sometimes someone will just up and realize that they're meant to be the new Santa...  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
And in this case, Nightingale, you became Santa because I chose you, yes!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Why me?  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Hmm... Intuition, I suppose!  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Pero desafortunadamente, you ended up turning me down.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
You said that if you became Santa Claus, you would no longer be able to treat the sick and injured.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I see... That does sound like something I'd say.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
So even though you were in the middle of becoming Santa Claus, I tried to take back your Santa Power so I could give it to somebody else.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
But I didn't count on anyone else showing up.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
Santa Power is the stuff of pure  
childhood wishes and dreams.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
It contains all the hopes and desires that grown-ups want for children.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
Toy companies' desire that this year's flagship will be a smash hit... Parents' hopes that their kids will be satisfied settling for a cheap substitute...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Was that last part really necessary?  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
......  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
Ho ho ho.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's a lot more crass than what I'd been picturing...  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
It just goes to show that not even Santa can escape the pull of capitalism, no!  
  
---  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Anyway, this other person quickly figured out what was going on, and made off with the bells that were supposed to collect the Santa Power.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Bells?  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
That's right. The bells you have now are only replicas. The real ones...  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
...are in Astolfo's hands.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Astolfo, huh...  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Please don't be too hard on him.  
I'm cierta he was only trying to help.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Even if it did end up doing the exact opposite.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Ah... I knew it.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
As usual, you don't miss a thing, Master.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
I'm sure Astolfo had only the best of intentions, but it's still his fault that things turned out this way.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
So on behalf of Santa Clauses everywhere,  
I apologize for this disturbance.  
  
---  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Astolfo then used the bells to draw out candidates, so he could decide which one would be the next Santa Claus.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
After all, any Servant has the potential to become Santa Claus.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
Anyway, Astolfo decided to have the Santa candidates fight each other to collect Santa Power, and whoever ended up with the most would become the next Santa Claus.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
That could have worked out okay...if it weren't for you still having a good deal of Santa Power yourself, Nightingale.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I do?  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
¡Sí! It means you started to become  
aware of your Santa self!  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Unfortunately, it also means that unless something is done, none of the candidates can fully assume the Santa mantle.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
Which is why we want you to make  
a choice here and now, Nightingale.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
Are you going to be Santa Claus, or aren't you?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...!  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
Are you going to ring the bells or leave them silent?  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Whatever you decide, we'll respect your choice.  
It's up to you.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Of course, if you do decide not to be Santa, you'll have to give back all the Santa Power you collected, yes!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Stay silent)  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...Yes, you're right. This is something I need to decide for myself.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I...  
  
**Narration:**   
Whether I'm Santa Claus or not,   
my work will remain the same.  
  
**Narration:**   
I will try to heal, amputate,  
and save as many people as I can.  
  
**Narration:**   
My path will never change, no matter if I live or die.  
  
**Narration:**   
...No, that's not right.  
It's okay if my path changes.  
  
**Narration:**   
No matter how much it may veer off in unexpected ways...it will still end up at the same destination.  
  
**Narration:**   
And in that case, I know full well what my answer is.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
My answer is...yes.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I've made up my mind.  
I'm going to be Santa Claus.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Brilliant, yes! But of course, that also means we need to make sure you're up to it.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
Agreed.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
After all, you can't have a Santa  
Claus without a Santa Claus arbiter.  
  
**Mash:**   
I-is that&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A rose Black Key!!!  
  
---  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Good to see you again, everyone. It's been  
quite a while since last we met, hasn't it?  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
What's that? You remember seeing me in the summer? Hahaha, I see your flights of fancy are as elaborate as ever.  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Who clauses the Santa Claus?  
I do, says the cuckoo.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
???  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
In other words, I'm here to judge  
whether you're fit to be Santa.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jeanne Lily said to tell you she's doing well.  
  
---  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Hahaha, I'm fully aware.  
But I'm glad to hear it all the same.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
We'll be taking part in your judgment too.  
Besides, I want to make sure I haven't lost my touch.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
I was hoping Astraea and swimsuit-Martha  
would join us too...  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
...but they said that would be overkill, yes.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'd rather face an army from the Demon Realm than all five of you at once.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
I agree. A lineup like that  
would be much too dangerous.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
That's why I thought we should keep those two in a separate block.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What would that be? Some kind of fistfighting world championship?  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Hahaha, a championship like that is the last place I'd ever want to fight. Between punches, takedowns, submission holds, and flying kicks, they'd have every approach covered perfectly.  
  
---  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
At any rate, we are the ones to whom you'll need to prove your dedication.  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Now...show us how much you're willing  
to fight for your Santa Clausdom!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Absolutely.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I still don't know why you're wearing that mask, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, but I'll be glad to face you all the same!  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Please stick to Santa Island Mask here,  
if you don't mind!  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
...!  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
This is quite a surprise.  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
I see you're still as strong as ever,  
even with a new Archer Spirit Origin.  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
And above all...  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
...I hear your dedication to being  
Santa Claus loud and clear.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
To be honest...I still don't feel confident that I can be a Santa Claus beloved by all, but&ndash;  
  
**???:**  
I see. So that is what has been plaguing you.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Then hear me, the first Santa Claus of Chaldea.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Pay it no mind.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Dreams, hope, love... We all think we know what they look like, but no two people share the same definitions for these things.  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
So if you truly believe that medicine is love,  
then that is the gift you should give.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
(I don't know... Medicine feels like a real stretch. Then again, sweet cough syrup does sound pretty yummy...)  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...I see.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's totally right, Nightingale.  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...Right. I'd almost forgotten.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
You believed in me right from  
the start, didn't you, Master?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
You never had any doubt that I could be Santa Claus.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Oh, yes. Now that I've won this battle,  
does that mean I'm officially Santa Claus?  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Not just yet, I'm afraid.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Astolfo still has the last key.  
Er, the last bell, I mean.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
Once you obtain that bell for yourself...  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
...then you can proudly declare that you are this year's Santa Claus.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
Make sure you do your best. I know I certainly did.  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
I'll be rooting for you on  
Jeanne Alter Santa Lily's behalf.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I see.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I still don't know what connection you have  
to Santa Claus, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, but&ndash;  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
My name is Santa Island Mask.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...At any rate, I appreciate your support.  
  
**Mash:**   
Nightingale?  
  
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry to interrupt, but would  
you mind ringing those bells for me?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Hm?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
You mean like this?  
  
**Mash:**   
Perfect. Thank you.  
  
**Mash:**   
Now that I've calibrated the sensors, I can see there's an almost identical ringing sound not too far from there.  
  
**Mash:**   
Which means&ndash;  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Now I see.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
So that's where we'll find Astolfo.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Come then, Master, let's be on our way!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All right! Time for the last flight of the event!  
  
---  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
Well, now that that's over with...  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
What say we all go watch the finale, yes?  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
You're still planning to go after all, huh?  
But yes, that sounds good to me too.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
Huh?  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hup!  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Well? What happened with Santa Claus, dammit!?  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
Oh, just what we need. Another loudmouth.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hey, why don't you go&ndash;  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Now, now, no need for that.  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
We can all go see whether Nightingale  
ends up as the next Santa or not.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
Isn't it already a foregone conclusion?  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
I'm not so sure.  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
From where I stand, it looks to me like she's still wrestling with something.  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
Whether she's able to get past it or not,  
well, that's up to her.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Ah c'mon, Amakusa, I'm sure it'll be fi&ndash;  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
...  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Ugh, fine, Something-Something Mask. Whatever.  
Let's just freaking go already!  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
In that, we agree. I too would like to witness the birth of the next Santa Claus myself.  
  
**Darius III:**   
AMAKUSANTAAA!!! (Translation: I'm so glad you're here. I was starting to feel awkward around all the ladies.)  
  
## Section 6: Becoming Santa Clause for Whose Sake?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Hey, Mante?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Yes, Stolfo?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
You know I'm a Saber now, right?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Right... Though I still can't quite believe it.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Hey, none of that!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Anyway, I was thinking, and you know what?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Maybe I could just be Santa myself!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Wat.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
H-hold on. Just back up a minute.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Didn't you bring all these Santas here to fight to determine which of them was the true Santa?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
I sure did!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
But while I was hanging around waiting for them to hash it out, I started thinking, “Wait. Maybe I'm already Santa!”  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Gah! I forgot how quickly things  
go off the rails with you!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
No way! Absolutely not!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
You only just became a Saber!  
You can't be Santa Claus too!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Sure I can!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
First I was a Rider, now I'm a Saber and Santa Claus too! It's all part of the Astolfo brand, baby!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Now you're just being greedy!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Come on, Stolfo, be reasonable. Remember what they say about people who chase after two hares at once?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
There's no possible way this can end well.  
You know that, right?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Why not!?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
I became a Saber no problem.  
What's the harm in being Santa too!?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
But your outfit's not even red! It's black!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Yeah... Well, my hair's pink! Close enough!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Besides, the very first Santa Servant basically wore all black too, right!?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Okay, yes, that's technically true, but still!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Come on, what's the big deal?  
I just wanna be Santa!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
And now I am!!!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
No, you're not!!!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Arghhh, this is so frustrating! Somebody! Anybody!  
Please, stop Stolfo before this gets out of hand!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
On it!  
  
---  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Master? Is that you!?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Master!? Where is [♂ he /♀️ she]?  
What page is [♂ he /♀️ she] on?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Oh Stolfo. I see your language  
function is still pretty glitchy...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hey hey.  
  
---  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Master!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
And...Huh? Nightingale?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Didn't you say you didn't wanna be Santa?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Yes, I did.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
However...I see now that I was  
unknowingly being selfish.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Hmm. I see.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
But, um, didn't you also say that if you did become Santa Claus, you'd be handing out&ndash;  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Medicine? That's right.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
It will taste sweet and delicious, just like candy...  
but it will still be medicine through and through.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Aw come on, you can't give away medicine as a present!  
That's just so...boring!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Yes, I agree.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
That's why I originally declined  
the offer to be Santa Claus.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
But I realized something thanks to my experiences here on Santa Island.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
There's nothing wrong with being boring.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Huh? Come on, you can't be serious.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
But I am. For the medicine I give away will be an expression of my love.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I will of course be sad if anyone chooses to refuse it, but I will not force it upon them if they don't want it.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Whatever the children do with  
my gifts is entirely up to them.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
But I thought you didn't even like children.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nightingale doesn't have anything against kids.  
  
---  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Huh? I don't get it.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
How can I put this...?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I admit that I don't always know how to behave around children, but that isn't because I dislike them.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I was just...afraid of them. You see, in my time,  
children frequently died much too young.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
That's true in pretty much any time.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
It's why those who are strong enough to fight will always have a duty to keep children safe.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I'm scared of children.  
They're so small, and weak, and fragile.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
That's why I want to give them medicine. I want them to be hale and hearty, so that they no longer have to fear the specter of death.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
That way...  
  
**Narration:**   
I might one day be able to give a gift...  
to the girl I never got to be.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Hmm... I don't get what you're talking about at all, but I can still tell you're really passionate about it!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
But I dunno, I still feel like something's missing!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Oh, give it up already, Stolfo.  
Or if you can't do that, why not just fight her now?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Yeah, good idea!  
Okay, let's do this!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
...Hm?  
  
**Nightingale Santa (Archer):**  
...  
  
**Astolfo (Saber):**  
But I'm gonna lose!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Ughhh.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Waaah! Okay, fine!  
I'm just gonna pull out ALL the stops then!  
  
**Mash:**   
...!  
  
**Mash:**   
Astolfo is gathering up magical energy!  
It looks like&ndash;  
  
**Astolfo:**   
All I gotta do is ring this bell, and I'll get both stronger AND more Santa...um...Santay! Maybe!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
So this is the power of the true Santa bell. Impressive. All my bell does is make a little jingling sound.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
I don't know how this works either, but I do know that this bell is amaaazing!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You know, there's something about that bell...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is it just me, or does that bell look kind of familiar?  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
No matter. I cannot afford to lose this fight!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Now that I have decided to be Santa Claus,  
I refuse to turn away from my chosen path!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
That's the spirit!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Um... I guess I don't need to be here anymore, so...  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Aw come on, Mante, I was counting on you to join me!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Ughhh! Okay, okay!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
It's my duty to help my fellow paladins,  
and I can't go back on that now!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Sorry about this, Master!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Then this is it. The final battle to determine who will be the true Santa!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
You or me, Santa baby! Let's do this!  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Noooooo! I loooooost!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
(Sigh) What a surprise.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Hey! What do you mean, “what a surprise”!?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
...Huh? I feel like...I'm getting weaker...?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
......  
  
**Bradamante:**   
......  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
I'm back to normal again!?  
Why? How? WHYYY!? HOOOOOOW!?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Hmm. I wonder...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Maybe it was that bell that turned you from a Rider into a Saber, Stolfo?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Really? Then, it wasn't because the heavens saw how hard I've been working and decided to grant my wish?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Pretty sure that wasn't it.  
  
---  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Master?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Take a closer look.  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Ah.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Ah.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Aaaaaah!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yup. It's a Holy Grail.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
Now it all makes sense!  
  
**Mash:**   
So that bell gathering magical energy was actually a just Holy Grail disguised as a bell!  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Then, we were spending precious magical energy resources just so someone could pretend to be Santa Claus!?  
  
**Goredolf:**   
Okay, I'm not recording anything in our archives about this mess. If word got out, Chaldea's reputation would be ruined!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
So that's what was going on. I turned into a Saber 'cause I'm always going around wishing I could be one!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
(Man, I'm so glad I didn't wish for something crass, like being a billionaire!)  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Now I see.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
So Stolfo lost his Saber powers when Nightingale officially became the bell's new owner!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Aw man. I guess life just never goes how you want!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Are you sure, Astolfo?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Hm?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Bwa!?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Wh-what's going on!?  
  
**Astolfo:**   
No way. I'm a Saber again!?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
H-hold on a minute!  
Did you just use the Holy Grail's power!?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Yes, I did. Though only enough to  
change Astolfo's Spirit Origin.  
  
**Both:**   
Huh!?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Any Holy Grails we find are supposed to be turned over to Chaldea anyway.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
And above all, I didn't gather this Santa Power myself.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I may have decided to be Santa Claus...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...but I have no intention of using this power to jump straight to the conclusion.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Now that I have made my decision, I'm going to see it through to the end fair and square.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Wow, so mature...  
  
**Bradamante:**   
No wonder she was the world's greatest nurse...  
I've never seen anyone else with so much willpower.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I'm perfectly happy to continue using this replica.  
Besides, I've grown rather fond of its timbre.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
(Sniff) Thanks, Nightingale! You're the best!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
(Sigh) I guess all I did was  
mess everything up again...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I wouldn't say that.  
  
---  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Huh?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Astolfo.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
If it weren't for you, I don't think I would have ever decided to be Santa Claus.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
If not for you, I would never have come to Santa Island or ever looked back on who I used to be.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
So...thank you.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Whoooa! I can't believe you just blushed!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
You're so cute!!!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Cute!?  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Wow... That blush could stop a  
thousand ships in their tracks...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She really is cute when she blushes, isn't she?  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Ahem!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
So, Master. I apologize for asking  
this on such short notice...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...but would it be okay if I continued my Santa Claus training for a while longer?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course!  
  
---  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Thank you, Master.  
  
**Astolfo:**   
Don't forget about me! If there's anything I can do to help with your training, just say the word!  
  
**Astolfo:**   
After all, I'm the greatest Saber who ever lived,  
so I'm sure I can be of service!  
  
**Bradamante:**   
Just don't get carried away this time, Stolfo.  
Remember, you're only a Saber now thanks to her.  
  
**Bradamante:**   
In the meantime, I'd be glad to help out too!  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I'm not gonna do shit, but I did bring along a bunch of goody-goodies who wanna help.  
  
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Seriously, though. Don't expect me to help.  
'Cause I won't. No freakin' way.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(She's totally going to help out...)  
  
---  
  
**Santa Alter:**   
As Chaldea's original Santa,  
I am honor bound to aid my successor.  
  
**Santa Island Mask:**   
I trust my answer goes without saying?  
Welcome, new Santa Claus. I'm glad to have you.  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
We'll help too, of course.  
  
**Quetzalcoatl Samba Santa:**   
¡Sí!  
  
**Darius III:**   
SANTA...  
  
**Altera Santa:**   
And so will Darius III.  
At least, I think that's what he's saying.  
  
**Mash:**   
I'll be glad to help from  
Chaldea in any way I can, too!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Thank you, everyone. In that case, there's one favor I'd like to ask of all of you.  
  
**J：All:**   
?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I'm told it's traditional to have a party for Christmas, so I was hoping you could all help me hold one.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Would...that be okay?  
  
**J：All:**   
Absolutely!  
  
## Epilogue: To You, Who Was Left Behind  
  
**Narration:**   
...I don't remember when I lost my sight.  
  
**Narration:**   
I told myself it wouldn't be a problem, but it turned out to be just as limiting as you'd expect.  
  
**Narration:**   
But even with my sight gone,  
my body continued to breathe.  
  
**Narration:**   
Spring turned to summer, summer turned to autumn, and before I knew it, winter had arrived.  
  
**Narration:**   
I can hear children buzzing with excitement,  
“Christmas” constantly on the tips of their tongues. I sigh.  
  
**Narration:**   
Christmas used to be just another holiday. Now it's a great event, with every family holding huge celebrations.  
  
**Narration:**   
I wonder if the people I saved got to celebrate Christmas. Did they thank Santa Claus for their new lease on life?  
  
**Narration:**   
Thoughts like that flit in and out of my mind, never staying long enough for me to dwell on them.  
  
**Narration:**   
I can tell that my own life  
will soon be coming to an end.  
  
**Narration:**   
I probably won't die today, or tomorrow, but I can tell I won't live to see the next winter.  
  
**Narration:**   
What about regrets?  
Is there anything I wish I'd done, but didn't?  
  
**Narration:**   
I feel like I have many such things...and, simultaneously, that I did everything I could ever have wanted to do.  
  
**Narration:**   
Regret and contentment seem like two sides of the same coin. I can't tell which of them I ought to feel.  
  
**Narration:**   
As I close my eyes and think about it further, I feel my body as it's gradually wrapped by something warm and cozy.  
  
**Narration:**   
...Is this a dream? Am I dreaming?  
  
**Girl:**   
It's Christmas, Florence.  
Today is Christmas.  
  
**Girl:**   
You might not care about it anymore  
now that you're a grown-up...  
  
**Girl:**   
...but you'd still be doing her a terrible disservice if you didn't celebrate it.  
  
**Narration:**   
Who are you, little girl?  
  
**Narration:**   
And who exactly would I be doing a disservice?  
  
**Girl:**   
You, of course.  
  
**Girl:**   
You're a wonderful person, Florence.  
And you accomplished some amazing things.  
  
**Girl:**   
I doubt there's a person anywhere in the world who doesn't hold your name in the highest regard.  
  
**Girl:**   
But I also doubt that means anything to you.  
  
**Girl:**   
This is exactly why nobody has  
noticed that poor little child!  
  
**Girl:**   
Do you know how painful it is to be forgotten?  
  
**Girl:**   
I bet you have no idea what it's li&ndash;  
  
**Narration:**   
No, Nursery Rhyme. I do know what it's like.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Oh?  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I finally found the courage to face you. You've been admonishing me for a long time now, haven't you?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Yes, I have.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I'm a hero of children everywhere.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
So I have no mercy for anyone who mistreats children.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Not even if that child&ndash;  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Is myself.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Exactly!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Then I suppose that makes me  
Scrooge from “A Christmas Carol.”  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
He was miserly, while I had other  
goals I cared about more.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
But whatever our excuses, the result was the same. He mistreated others' children, while I mistreated myself.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
That's right. But as long as you understand that now, that's enough for me.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Although, in that case...  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Does this mean you, Astolfo, and Master were my three Christmas spirits?  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Oh my. I hadn't thought of it that way, but I love it! What a wonderful interpretation!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Though of course, I doubt Astolfo and Master had any idea of the roles they were playing.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I'm the only one who was consciously testing you.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I see...  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I would never dream of saying  
anything to you as your usual self.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I can't even count how many lives  
you must have saved, after all.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
But once I knew you were going to be Santa Claus...  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...I thought it was time you finally  
faced who you were as a child.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
That's why I tormented you by showing you this dream over and over.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
I'm sorry, Florence.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
That's quite all right.  
In fact, I'm grateful to you.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
I wouldn't be here now if it wasn't for you.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
So thank you, White Knight,  
hero of children everywhere.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
You're welcome, Ms. Nightingale! You know, you really are as pretty as the bird you're named for!  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Anyway, that's all I had to say,  
so now it's time to say goodbye.  
  
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Besides, I have to wake up early to see what you brought me, Santa!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
...  
  
**C：???:**  
Um...  
  
**Narration:**   
I pick my former self up and hold her tight,  
marveling at how tiny I used to be...  
  
**Narration:**   
...and say something I may or may not  
have once said long, long ago.  
  
**Narration:**   
Happy words&ndash;Something  
every child deserves to hear.  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Merry Christmas, Florence Nightingale.  
  
**C：???:**  
(Gasp)...!  
  
**Nightingale Santa:**   
Merry Christmas, Florence Nightingale.  
  
**Narration:**   
Merry... Merry Christmas, Florence Nightingale!
