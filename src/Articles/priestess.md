# Compiled Chronological Appearances of the Alien Priestess    
    
As of the beginning of Ordeal Call, the Alien Priestess remains a complete enigma.  
Therefore, this page is created to objectively display every single appearance she has made with surrounding context - especially since most of them cannot be recorded in TRI-HERMES due to her not having dialogue.      
    
NA script will be used up to LB6, while Rayshift's translation will be used for LB7.

**Holmes:**    
...And there you are. That is the situation we find ourselves in.    
    
**Holmes:**    
Chaldea is under attack by an unknown military force. All exits have been sealed off, preventing any escape.    
    
**Holmes:**    
Goredolf's private soldiers are doing their best to fight the intruders off, but it won't be long now before our adversary claims victory.    
    
**Holmes:**    
Our task is quite simple. As we cannot escape outside, we will escape underground.    
    
**Holmes:**    
Our adversary has yet to occupy the underground hangar, so that is where we will go. There we will find a shipping container in which we can take shelter.    
    
### Cast Reaches Hangar

This is...the hangar!?

**Mash:**    
That's right. This is where Chaldea stores various kinds of equipment, and disposes of materials it no longer needs...    
    
**Mash:**    
But that huge shipping container didn't used to be here! What could it be...?    
    
### Goredolf's Desperate Plea    
    
**P. A. System:**     
Aaagh! Ow, owww...! Ah...Aah...Ghnnn...!    
    
**P. A. System:**     
...Why. Why do things always turn out like this? Why do they always turn on me in the end!?    
    
**P. A. System:**     
This always happens to me! Always! Nothing's changed at all...!    
    
**P. A. System:**     
No matter where I go, no matter what I try, I was always an outcast. A loser. A social leper.    
    
**P. A. System:**     
I knew what everyone was thinking! I knew they all hated me! But what was I supposed to do about it!?    
    
**P. A. System:**     
I don't know WHY they hated me! I don't know HOW to get people to like me!

**P. A. System:**     
But I tried! I did the best I could!    
    
**P. A. System:**     
I never had my sights set on first place, you know? I would've been happy with second or third!    
    
**P. A. System:**     
But, haha, just look at how things turned out. Forget third! I didn't even end up placing at all!    
    
**P. A. System:**     
Ah...Ow, owww! Stop it! Stop iiit!    
    
**P. A. System:**     
Dammit! After a life of failure, I thought this would finally, FINALLY be my shot at success...!    
    
**P. A. System:**     
But a loser is all I'll ever be, no matter where I go or what I do. Dammit...Dammit...!!!    
    
**P. A. System:**     
I don't wanna die! I'm not ready to die! After all...    
    
**P. A. System:**     
No one's ever praised me before! No one's ever loved me before...!

### Goredolf Rescued    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/19JDfIE.png)    
    
**Goredolf:**    
Don't you DARE talk back to me! Just shut the hell up and start fixing this mess you made!    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/qDWCDpE.png)    
    
**Goredolf:**    
Oogh, just thinking about it is giving me the shakes! C-c-c-come on then, get to work!

**Da Vinci:**    
You see? I knew this would be more trouble than this coglione is worth. Anyway, we REALLY don't have time to explain everything right now.    
    
**Da Vinci:**    
For the moment, let's get back to safety. I'm sure everyone else is on pins and needles waiting for us.    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/LLQxBNC.png)    
    
**Mash:**    
You're right. We'll need to apologize to them. Still...    
    
**Mash:**    
I'm glad we weren't too late. Aren't you, Senpai?    
    
**Fujimaru:**    
Absolutely!

**Priest:**    
Now, time for our last job.    
    
**Priest:**    
The Pseudo-Celestial Sphere Chaldeas...The miracle that leads to the Root. The miracle that the Animusphere family wished for and dreamed about for over two millennia...    
    
**Priest:**    
Part of me wishes we didn't have to trample all over this dream, but such is life.    
    
**Priest:**    
It is the job of adults to teach children the harsh truth of reality. Even the tsar fears this celestial sphere.    
    
**Priest:**    
After all, changing the past via Rayshifting is the one threat we can't counter.    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/eZxkc5m.png)    
    
**???:**    
...So this is Chaldeas. It looks just like an Easter egg...    
    
**???:**    
So this is the device I must freeze, Father?    
    
**Priest:**    
That's right. That is what the tsar wants. You must use your Noble Phantasm to defeat the traitors.    
    
**Priest:**    
You must bury this magnificent crown jewel of humanity yourself, in a coffin of permafrost.    
    
**Priest:**    
What will you do, Your Imperial Highness, Grand Duchess Anastasia?

**Kirschtaria:**    
...The roots of cosmic fantasy have descended upon us. The advent of the Foreign God is at hand.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
After three months, the Lostbelts have finished their rewrites. Both this planet, and the next generation of human history, now belong to us.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
...But that is not enough. I will not be satisfied with that alone.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
The sages from Proper Human History abandoned humans in their naivete. He who called himself the King of Mages first pitied humanity, but soon washed his hands of them.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
But not me. I will never relax my grip.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
It has been two thousand years since Mystics disappeared, when the foundations of the world were passed on to mankind...    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
Now, I will attempt to reach a world that no sage ever could. I will attempt to enact an idea that no mage has ever before conceived.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
Just you watch, Marisbury Animusphere. Watch as I achieve what you only ever dared dream of.

### Ivan's Confession    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
......Forgive me, Macarius.    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
I have become something dreadful.    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/HnVCq9q.png)    
    
**Priest:**    
What do you mean, my tsar?    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
I have been alive for four hundred and fifty years,and I will surely continue to live forever.    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
But I am still not strong enough. My glory as tsar is...lacking.    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
I must bring light to all reaches of the world. I must bring love capable of withstanding this blizzard to all the Yaga.    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
And to do that...I must eliminate all those with evil in their hearts.    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
I have received a revelation from a god. Though it may be a god from a distant land, it is still very much like the God we know.    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
This god told me to spread the glory of Russia far and wide, and to condemn those worlds that did not end up like our own.    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
They told me to wipe out the so-called proper humanity who did not see fit to save us, to eliminate the cursed stargazers of Chaldea!    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
...But alas, I cannot take action against them myself. I have already made the mistake of acting in anger.    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
And in consequence, an entire village is gone.    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/KodMyLq.png)    
    
**Priest:**    
Those Yaga had abandoned their faith,and neglected to pay you homage, tsar.    
    
**Priest:**    
It was only a matter of time until they gave in to the temptations of evil, and fell prey to the blizzard. You need not pity them.    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
You may be right...And yet...if only I were stronger, this could all have been avoided...    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
The Foreign God brought salvation upon this land. It gave us the Tree of Emptiness...the power with which to fight the other Lostbelts.    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
Thanks to the Foreign God's blessing, the entire world will one day be just like this Russia...    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
...I...I do not care for that power...    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
I may be the rightful ruler of the world...but what would I rule if the entire world were frozen solid?    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
I am the great Tsar...The Tsar cannot make mistakes, the Tsar can never err...    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
This time...This time, the glory of my great Russia will know no bounds. I will make sure of it.    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
And to do that, I will need the Oprichniki...My faithful hunting dogs who will lay the groundwork to make my dream possible...    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
Macarius...I AM doing the right thing, aren't I? I must not...stop now...surely...?    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/VBl74p6.png)    
    
**Priest:**    
Of course you are, and of course you must not, tsar. But the time is not yet right for you to awaken.    
    
**Priest:**    
You must let your wounds heal and wait for the day when your eyes will truly open.    
    
**Priest:**    
That will be a day of feasting and celebration. The day when a new Russia finally blooms.    
    
**Priest:**    
But for now, you must rest and recuperate. You must sleep.    
    
**Ivan the Terrible:**    
Yes...Yes...I cannot hear the piano any longer, but...Ah, Macarius...If that is what you say, then that is what I shall do...    
    
**Priest:**    
...The Tsar has gone back to sleep. Russia will once again know peace, albeit temporarily.    
    
**Priest:**    
Now we no longer need to worry about the Tsar knocking down the Tree of Emptiness. Will this do, O Foreign Priestess?    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/M3MxGjH.png)

...    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/fN2RDXo.png)    
    
**Priest:**    
Heh. I can't tell if she's happy or upset.    
    
**Priest:**    
Even if I can't understand her language, I should at least learn to read her expressions, or I'll never be able to listen to her confessions.    
    
### The Priestess' Petty Revenge

**Beowulf:**    
But this thing...I can't tell what it is. I can see them just fine, but it feels like they're not even here...!    
    
**Mash:**    
Border! Border, do you read me!?    
    
**Mash:**    
Please examine the point thirty meters above the Tree of Emptiness's roots! There's something there!

Please, put it up on the monitor immediately!

Yup, I'm sure. The readings all check out. What you see is what you get, Holmes. Or don't get, as it were.

**Holmes:**    
I'm afraid we can't get any reading on whatever that thing is from the Border, Mash. But I can at least confirm that there is SOMETHING right in front of you.    
    
**Holmes:**    
Because there is NOTHING there, in the truest sense of the word. Not a single signal given off by anything you could find on Earth.    
    
**Holmes:**    
It's like reality itself has been hollowed out to form a blank void in the shape of a person.    
    
**Holmes:**    
Machines may not be able to observe this shadow,but the emptiness proves there is SOMETHING.

Either way, we can't just leave it lying around. Besides, we need to take advantage of everything we can use.

Mash, Fujimaru, you know what to do!    
    
**Mash:**    
Yes. Not to worry. I can store it in my shield,just like I did with all the other Holy Grails.

I'll collect the Pseudo-Holy Grail now.

Yes, humans have demonstrated incredible power before. At times, they've rebelled against gods, tricked giants, and even killed dragons.    
    
**Sigurd:**    
But not here.    
    
**Sigurd:**    
The humans here aren't people anymore. They're livestock. None of them are any threat to you.    
    
**Sigurd:**    
These humans used to be just like the ones in Proper Human History: weak, transient beings whose only purpose was to be our prey.    
    
**Ophelia:**    
...This world belongs to a goddess.    
    
**Ophelia:**    
Even if there are less than ten thousand humans here,it is still a pure land ruled by a goddess of old.    
    
**Ophelia:**    
Lord Kirschtaria even said it could end up the last Lostbelt left standing...    
    
**Ophelia:**    
The fact that a goddess rules it also means it's the perfect place to experiment.    
    
**Ophelia:**    
That's why this Lostbelt has so much potential. In fact, it is far more than the sum of its parts.    
    
**Sigurd:**    
Oh?    
    
**Ophelia:**    
...In terms of potential, at any rate.    
    
**Ophelia:**    
If we can grow our tree to maturity, we might be able to breathe new life into humanity and nature alike.    
    
**Ophelia:**    
I don't care how much contempt you have for humanity as a result of your origins and temperament.    
    
**Ophelia:**    
All I care about is that you don't let your guard down. Again: you're my shield and my sword. Don't forget that.    
    
**Ophelia:**    
You and I share the same responsibility:    
    
**Ophelia:**    
We must grow this Lostbelt's Tree of Emptiness to full maturity. That is your sole concern.    
    
**Sigurd:**    
Hmph.    
    
**Sigurd:**    
I've never been much of a gardener, but if you insist, Ophelia, I guess I've got no choice.    
    
**Ophelia:**

**Ophelia:**    
(I can still feel his gaze...I guess my knight will always be peeping on me, no matter how many times I tell him not to. )    
    
**Ophelia:**    
I can tell you're still there, smirking at me from behind my back. Just how long are you planning on watching me?

This is separate from our whole Crypter deal, but I'm going to give you some advice: go easy on yourself.    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/oLBwZG1.png)

Huh?    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
I don't mean as a mage. I mean as a woman.    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
You may not like wearing makeup,but a little foundation wouldn't kill you.    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
Your skin might be smooth and blemish-free now, but do you really think that'll last with all the stress you've been putting yourself under?    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
You've got a lovely face, honey. Don't hide it by always staring at the ground.    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/4pQs1mo.png)    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
Besides, don't you want to look your best for Wodime?    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/mpMi7Kh.png)    
    
**Ophelia:**    
...Yes, I do. I can't put anything past you, can I?    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
I just call it like I see it. Hehe, I still have a long way to go myself!    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
I really have no business intruding so much on your secrets, however much I just love it.    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
Anyway, I'd better go. Besides, I'm worried about our dear Kadoc.    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
It'd be nice if I could get in touch with Russia,but he just refuses to answer my calls...    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
...Oh well. If we can't get in touch with him now that Chaldea's showed up there, I guess that's kind of an answer on its own...    
    
**Ophelia:**    
......    
    
**Ophelia:**    
So, Brynhild has finally awakened...    
    
**Ophelia:**    
So much for all that work to keep her a secret.

**Ophelia:**    
...You again.    
    
**Ophelia:**    
What do you want? Are you here to scold me? Are you saying I should've killed her when I had the chance?    
    
**Ophelia:**    
I tried. Believe me, I really tried.    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/JMR6Zm3.png)    
    
**Ophelia:**    
But...    
    
**Narration:**    
I just couldn't do it. I knew she died once,when her love went unrequited.    
    
**Narration:**    
That's why...I just couldn't bring myself to kill her.    
    
**Narration:**    
It's not because I saw myself in her...    
    
**Narration:**    
I'm not so narcissistic as to compare myself to a legendary Valkyrie.    
    
**Narration:**    
I just thought...I could never do what she did.    
    
**Narration:**    
I flinched, instinctively. Brynhild...is stronger than I'll ever be.    
    
**Narration:**    
Everything about her...and the way she lived her life.    
    
**Narration:**    
How could I ever kill someone like that? Especially by using the demonic sword of the man she loved?    
    
**Ophelia:**    
...I just couldn't do it...    
    
**Ophelia:**    
And then the queen decided to love her,which meant she had to be kept alive.

**Sigurd:**    
Talking to yourself again?    
    
**Sigurd:**    
I see being a Crypter doesn't keep you from feeling lonely at night. You really are a woman, aren't you, Ophelia?    
    
**Ophelia:**    
Shut up.    
    
**Sigurd:**    
Heh. What are you glaring at me for? Isn't there someone else you should be trying to get rid of?

**Narration:**    
Fire walked the earth.    
    
**Narration:**    
Here in this Lostbelt, a place nearly devoid of life,a giant strode about the land like a conquering king.    
    
**Narration:**    
Onward he walked, never straying from his path towards the Lostbelt's fiery northern mountains.    
    
**Narration:**    
He is the king of the giants. The king of fire.    
    
**Narration:**    
The giants that gather at his feet are crushed beneath his heels. The ice beasts drawn to his light are melted in an instant.    
    
**Narration:**    
...He is a lofty king.    
    
**Narration:**    
Though he may carry me on his shoulder, I am well aware there is no one who can truly be close to him.    
    
**Narration:**    
There is nothing else that can view the world from his great height.    
    
**Narration:**    
No...That may not be quite true any longer.    
    
**Narration:**    
My Mystic Eye can see it. An enormous tree beyond the fiery mountains, stretching towards the heavens...    
    
**Narration:**    
...a figure just as imposing as the king of giants.    
    
**Narration:**    
...The Tree of Emptiness.

**Ophelia:**    
Do I look a complete fool to you now? Yes. I'm sure I do.    
    
**Ophelia:**    
I'd probably laugh too if I saw myself now.    
    
**???:**

**Ophelia:**    
Huh...?    
    
**Ophelia:**    
I'm sorry. I can't tell what you're saying.    
    
**Ophelia:**    
I have some facility with lipreading, but it is not helpful when you speak a language I do not know.

### Tortured-In-Arms?    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/tZq1KQI.png)    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Welp...I certainly won't be expanding my clientele anytime soon if I don't get out of this prison. I can't believe this talisman is the genuine article.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
I never thought humans would be able to keep the sage arts working for over two thousand years, but I was clearly wrong.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
They've even managed to advance them here. I really need to leave; this Lostbelt and I do NOT get along.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
I mean, what was a mere human thinking, going all the way to Mt. Penglai to claim secret sage arts?    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
If you're going to go that far, you might as well have stayed there and become a sage yourself!    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Where does this clown get off coming back to the human world and staying on as emperor!?    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Ugh, just thinking about that stupid emperor and that stupid missing face pisses me off.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
I can't believe I let myself get trapped like this all because I couldn't get a read on the emperor's expressions!    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/mSS0jac.png)    
    
**???:**    
...    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
...Oh, it's you. I didn't think I would see you in a peaceful Lostbelt like this.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
But I guess you show up just about anywhere. What is it, Foreign Priestess?    
    
**???:**    
.........    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Oh for...I have no idea what you're saying. I wish you would hurry up and learn our language already...    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
I wonder if Kirschtaria already understands you.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Maybe he's even keeping a record of everything you've been saying and doing that involves us.    
    
**???:**    
...    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Well, none of that's any of my business.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
After all, my contract is with the Foreign God,not you, even if you do speak for it.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
But never mind that. Do you think you could peel this talisman off for me?    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
This Lostbelt's king is a tough negotiator. The other Lostbelt kings might be monsters that no human can control...    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
...but Qin Shi Huang pulls that off while still somehow remaining human.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Monsters that rely on brute strength are terrifying just by existing, but devious humans are terrifying because of what they actually do.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
So I promise you, if something isn't done soon, the Crypters are going to lose their hold on this Lostbelt.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
That archaic emperor might even end up cutting down the Tree of Emptiness before it can become your seedbed, you know?    
    
**A：Qin Shi Huang:**    
Archaic, you say. Do tell, Yanyanski,exactly which part of us is archaic? Hm?    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
...Dammit.    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
Enjoying your conversation with the wall, are you? We see you must have finally “lost it,” as they say.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Heh. I'm flattered you'd go out of your way just to peep on me in my little cell here, Your Imperial Majesty.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Teehee, that you can peep anywhere you want, yet you still can't see what's really important. What a joke.    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
...We have passed judgment on Chaldea.    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
Now, the time has come to properly assess your conduct as a visitor of our empire.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Has it now? Does this mean you've finally realized that Chaldea was your mortal enemy all along?    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
Indeed, we have. But that does not absolve you of your own, separate crimes.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Whatever do you mean? The enemy of my enemy is my friend, right?    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Chaldea is both your enemy and mine, Your Imperial Majesty. I'm certainly not the one who's been ruining your farms.    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
But you are the one who brought those Demonic Beasts that began eating our people around the time Chaldea appeared, no?    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
...(Crap. I'd forgotten about that...)    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Oh, uh, well, that's strange. I guess they, uh, fell out of my pocket or...something?    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
But really, do you even have any proof that that was my mistake?    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
There's no difference between summoning Demonic Beasts and summoning Heroic Spirits, after all. How do you know Chaldea isn't just playing dumb?    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
Chaldea takes pleasure in disturbing my people's way of life. They would never kill them just for sport.    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
But you, on the other hand, take pleasure in nothing so much as messily devouring humans.    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
Thus, we hardly need conduct a thorough investigation to determine your guilt.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
...I see. So you still have a record of my past self, even in this Lostbelt.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
All right then, what are you going to do about it?    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Do you even have time to waste now that you know that Chaldea is the greatest threat to you and your nation?    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
It is true that we do not. While we are quite adept at parallel processing, our greatest concern is indeed Chaldea.    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
We can only afford to dedicate our rare spare moments to dealing with you.    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/MxrZ7Gh.png)    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
So we are afraid that your interim punishment will have to be somewhat...artless. Messy.    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
That talisman seals your powers, preventing you from fighting back, yes? Then we can delegate your punishment to these automata.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Wha...    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
As such, these puppets will torture you until we can see to your punishment ourself.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Huh? H-hang on! You're joking, right?    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
I mean, you're Qin Shi Huang, the great emperor of this domain! Surely you can't be so completely twisted!    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
We do not do this for our own enjoyment. It is our duty to see justice served.    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/Tl1O3ht.png)    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
W-wait...Please...Don't do&ndash;Eegh! Gaaaaaah!!!    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
We are sorry about this,but we simply lack the information...    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
...to determine how spirits such as Servants and Alter Egos behave in worlds that are not their own.    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
For all we know, destroying your body, accidentally or otherwise, may even set you free.    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
Neither can we afford to let you bury this place in sulfur.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Ghh...Aah...Ow, ow ow ow aaaaaah! Eegh! Gaaah!    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
But so long as you manifest here, you are bound to that physical body. This much we are certain of.    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
So we will keep you alive, but ensure you lack the strength to escape.    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
If we order your body drilled full of holes, day and night, never piercing major blood vessels, you should survive, but be unable to replenish your magical energy, and so have no choice but to behave.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
P-please...Forgive me...Just let me go and...I promise I'll leave right...away!    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
I'll never come to this Lostbelt again...So please...Please, stop this...    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
Out of the question. Even if you did leave,you would only sow more evil in other histories, no?    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
Besides, there is more to you than meets the eye. You weigh far more than all the Servants combined.    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
Even I was shocked to see your soul...or rather, your Spirit Origin's mass, weighs nearly one hundred thousand tons.    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/qytYSd7.png)    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
...!    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
We are destined to rule all of the human world. That will never change, regardless of what time or fate itself may have in store.    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
As you are a sworn enemy of mankind, we have all the more reason to deny you your freedom.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
So you even care about peace in the other Lostbelts...? You really are hopeless, aren't you...    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
Very well. Your torment in our land will continue until you turn to stone.    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
We can put you into eternal slumber once we devise a proper sealing ritual for you. Until that day comes, you will face justice for your crimes.    
    
**Qin Shi Huang:**    
We suggest you spend this eternity of torture reflecting on the many people you have killed, and the pain and suffering you caused them.    
    
**Koyanskaya:**    
Until I turn to stone? Who does this jerk think I am, Sun Wukong...?

Ah...No, please&ndash;Gaaaaaahhh!!!

### Douman Gets The Wrong Idea    
    
::: tip Lib Note    
We know from one of the LB1 scenes through Kirei that the Alien God Apostles are also unable to understand the Priestess.     
So we know Douman isn't actually understanding Priestess here.    
On another note, Douman's overall duty and command was to manage ALL the LB Kings when he only stayed cooped up here. Hm..

And to save it, you have no choice but to cut down these Trees of Emptiness...

**Lakshmi:**    
Back then, I never thought about what the future might hold.    
    
**Lakshmi:**    
There were only things I had to do, and only one path available to me: the path of fighting to protect my homeland. So that's what I did.    
    
**Lakshmi:**    
I didn't have some larger plan in mind, like driving every last one of the British out of India, or destroying Britain itself...

The truth is, I never stopped to think about what the future might hold...    
    
**Lakshmi:**    
...though it should have been obvious that, win or lose, there would be more to be done once the war was over.

Then again, I suppose my options were so limited,and the path I had to walk so difficult...

**Lakshmi:**    
At any rate, I'm glad you told me what you really think.    
    
**Lakshmi:**    
Just knowing that you do feel bad for the people in these Lostbelts is something of a relief.

But, I also have no intention of letting this false god continue to have his way with these people.    
    
**Lakshmi:**    
We may ultimately only be putting this problem off until later...but right now, the only way to protect them is to keep doing what I've been doing.

You know, I have to ask. Why did you come here when I asked you to?

Didn't it occur to you that I might decide to kill you in order to keep these people safe?

So, for the time being, nothing needs to change. I will continue to fight this false god alongside you.

We may disagree on some things, but right now,that shared goal is all that matters.

We didn't give the people of this world weapons and teach them to fight so they could live.

We just wanted them to survive to use them to defeat Arjuna, with no real concern for what came afterward.

The only reason we helped these people was so that we could more efficiently erase their god, and eventually, them.

She's looking at me sprawled out and helpless,

**Kirschtaria:**    
So you're the unidentified mage who's been going around helping people in each of the Lostbelts...    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
The one from Chaldea.

**Fujimaru 1:**

**Kirschtaria:**    
What are you doing here?    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
My understanding is that your goal is to investigate and assess the people of each Lostbelt.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
So I fail to see what reason you have to aid the remnants of Chaldea.

Since when do I need a reason to help Chaldea?    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/9v2Xs0y.png)    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
I suppose I can't argue with that.

...Am I right to presume this is a onetime only mistake, Doctor?    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/A2Qq5FF.png)    
    
**Robed Figure:**    
Of course, Kirschtaria. The Foreign God    
once saved you from the brink of death.    
    
**Robed Figure:**    
It is therefore only fair that the Chaldeans be similarly saved, if only once. Don't you think that's the best way to ensure you're both on equal ground?    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/Ngaqq6m.png)    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
I see. True, I can't deny that is only fair.    
You always did have a way with words.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
While I would like to disregard your argument and finish them off for good, I would rather not have to fight you in the process.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
It would be my second fight, after all,    
and that is something I must avoid for now.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
Very well. Now that you have made yourself known,    
I will be gracious and let you save face.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
What do you say I end this battle now, let Chaldea survive yet again, and we leave it at that?    
    
**Robed Figure:**    
Agreed. I also prefer to avoid needless conflict, after all. Why not save our energy for when we really need it?    
    
**Robed Figure:**    
If you leave, then so will I. And I don't just mean here and now. I mean from this entire Lostbelt, of course.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
I'm impressed you have the gall to say that. As if you hadn't long since washed your hands of the matter.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
Farewell then, Doctor.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
I doubt we'll ever see each other again, so let me leave you with one word of caution: this impression of yours is not particularly convincing.

**Fujimaru:**    
No way!!!    
    
**Mandricardo:**    
Then what do you suggest we do instead?    
    
**Orion:**    
We force the Zeus Klironomia to shut down.    
Hephaestus!

Yes.

**Orion:**    
Hephaestus!    
There's got to be a way to make this work, right!?    
    
**Orion:**    
If there wasn't, you'd have already said something.    
    
**Hephaestus:**    
...First, acquire Athena Klironomia.    
    
**Hephaestus:**    
Then re-extract Hephaestus Klironomia to use again.

**Holmes:**

From there, we inject her with Athena Klironomia,    
then re-extract the Hephaestus Klironomia?

Correct.

**Peperoncino:**    
I still haven't been punished for my failure    
with the Indian Lostbelt, right?    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
So go ahead and punish me however you see fit,    
Wodime. Whatever it is, I can take it.    

![](https://i.imgur.com/qMcQfZu.png)
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
I hope I have not given you cause to mistake me, Pepe.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
We Crypters are colleagues, nothing more. I have no more authority to punish you than any of the others do.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
For the time being, Scandinavia Peperoncino,    
let's just be glad you're all right.    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
You're sure taking all this in stride.    
Not that I expected anything less, of course.    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
But I still wouldn't feel right getting off scot-free.    
Why don't you at least take my Sirius Light?    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
Sure, I could probably save more face with the Foreign    
God if I offered it up to them instead...    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
...but I couldn't care less about getting in either    
the Foreign God or the Alter Egos' good graces.    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
So here, hon, you can have my Sirius Light.    
Make sure you make good use of it.    

![](https://i.imgur.com/gLUroTt.png)
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
Thank you, Pepe, but there's no need for that.    
You can keep yours.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
The Sirius Light has not been my responsibility since Team A ceased to be relevant.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
So no, you should hang onto yours.    
What you do with it is up to you.

**Peperoncino:**

So Ophelia didn't happen to die after using hers.    
She died BECAUSE she used her Sirius Light.

Nooow I get it. I'm starting to see just a little    
more of what your relationship was really like.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
Despise me if you wish.    
You are probably right to do so.

**Peperoncino:**    
Despise you? Now you're just insulting me, Wodime.    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
I think the fact that you're refusing to say anything    
just goes to show how much integrity you have.    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
Up to this point, I still wasn't    
sure who was connected to what...    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
...but I think I'm finally starting    
to see how the pieces fit together.

Teehee! It never really sunk in before, but I guess    
we really are enemies of humanity after all!

**Kirschtaria:**    
I have to say, Pepe, your sheer mental fortitude never fails to surprise me. I'm amazed you can still smile like that under these circumstances.    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
Hey, it's the one thing I've got going for me. Though, in my case, it's more despair than self-possession.    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
But hey, the important things are that I'm alive right now, and what it is I need to do next, right?    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
I'd never get anywhere if I spent all my time    
fretting about a past I can't change.    

![](https://i.imgur.com/moJxQLW.png)
    
**Peperoncino:**    
So I'm just going to tell you this, in the hope    
that it might lead to an even more fun future.    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
You know how the Disciples are always telling us the Foreign God wants the Lostbelts to flourish, and that the strongest one will become the foundation of a new humanity?    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
Well, I'm positive they're lying.    
They're not planning on any of the Lostbelts surviving.    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
While we've been hoping that one of the Lostbelts    
would become the next Proper Human History...    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
...they've got other plans entirely.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
...And why do you think that?    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
Hehe. I heard it straight from the Alter Ego's mouth back when he was elated at the prospect of his seemingly assured victory.    
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/ARA4uiD.png)
	
**Peperoncino:**    
I swear, I never would've guessed his fondness for hearing himself talk would actually work in our favor!    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
Haha. I see. So you got Limbo to talk.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
Then I won't be responsible for what you've learned, and it won't violate my contract with the Foreign God.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
...That being said, Myourenji, I can't say anything    
more in response to what you've just told me.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
All I can tell you is that I am prepared to establish    
this Lostbelt as the new Proper Human History...    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
...and that I have done everything    
I can to see that vision made reality.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
I will use everything at my disposal to ensure this Atlantic Lostbelt becomes this planet's future.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
In the meantime, I want you to carry out your duties as a member of Team A in whatever way you feel is best.    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
...    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
Hey, you don't have to tell me.    
I was already planning to do whatever I wanted.    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
Besides, I was never really into the whole    
“king of the Earth” competition thing, anyway.    
    
**Peperoncino:**    
But let me know if you ever need help with anything, all right? I'm not THAT much of an ingrate, you know.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
...Not that much of an ingrate, huh.    

![](https://i.imgur.com/oSLlK2D.png)
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
Of course I know that, Pepe.    
You've been of help to me more often than you realize.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
You always described yourself as a cold-blooded killer, but in fact, you were always the most humane...always honored your obligations more than any of us.

Oh? Unless I am very much mistaken, there is a great deal of venom in your expression. Are you unhappy with what we just discussed?    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
Peperoncino came to his conclusions based on what the Alter Ego said. There's no need to eliminate him.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
Nor did I tell the other Crypters any of the Foreign God's secrets.

Everything is proceeding according to plan. The Tree of Emptiness is now a fully grown catalyst, ready to bring your true form down to this world.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
Zeus no doubt means to use    
this energy for his own ideals.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
For my part, I have no intention of getting in his way.    
I promised him I wouldn't, after all.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
We agreed that, though our positions may be very different, Zeus and I would work together to ensure that the Atlantic Lostbelt is fully completed.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
And I will not be going back on my word.    

![](https://i.imgur.com/oSLlK2D.png)
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
Not after he trusted me enough to let    
me see him in a moment of weakness.    

![](https://i.imgur.com/ANsLHzF.png)
    
**Foreign Priestess:**    
...    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
I'm well aware. If Zeus's plan comes to fruition...    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
...the Tree of Emptiness's magical energy will be depleted, and the Foreign God's descent will be delayed.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
Should that happen, I will be considered in breach of contract, and my life will be forfeit.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
...But that is not going to happen.    
Much as it pains me to say this as his friend...    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
Zeus's ideals will never work, even if his plan is flawless. Once they fail, that is where I come into play.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
Don't worry, I'll see that my job is done perfectly.    
I value my life as much as anyone, after all.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
It would be equally trivial for me to complete this    
Lostbelt and see Zeus's ideals realized...    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
...or to conclude this Lostbelt and let    
the Foreign God descend upon this world.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
The only unknown factor that could possibly pose an obstacle to either of those outcomes is Chaldea, and whatever course of action Fujimaru    
chooses to pursue.    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
I only hope [♂ his / ♀️ her] spirit isn't yet broken. I'm counting    
on [♂ him / ♀️ her] to make [♂ his / ♀️ her] way here and once more throw    
[♂ himself / ♀️ herself] into battle against me...    
    
**Kirschtaria:**    
...so that I can conclusively demonstrate    
to [♂ him / ♀️ her] that [♂ his / ♀️ her] efforts were for naught.    
    
### She speaks!

**Narration:**    
The black beam of light...    
    
**Narration:**    
...was a dream...a fiction designed to kill a god.    
    
**Narration:**    
A conceptual blade forged to shatter    
beings with nigh infinite life spans.    
    
**Narration:**    
The concept of natural life span capable of ending the world...is what made it possible to bring an end to a life that would otherwise go on forever.    
    
**Narration:**    
The gun barrel replica, charged with god-slaying particles, made it possible to shatter unshatterable life.    
    
**Narration:**    
The black beam of light brought death.    
A finality. An end.    
    
**Narration:**    
Ahh, at last...    
    
**Narration:**    
At last, I can finally make my way to you.    
    
**Narration:**    
You left my embrace when you encountered the darkness.    
You changed irrevocably.    
    
**Narration:**    
You became a mother, and gained so very, very much.    
    
**Narration:**    
You smiled so proudly when I lost you forever, during    
the fourth machia. I've never forgotten that smile.    
    
**Narration:**    
I loved you so much.    
I loved you more than anything.    
    
**Narration:**    
Persephone.    
    
**Narration:**    
At last...I can finally go where you are.    
    
**Narration:**    
Demeter.    
    
**Narration:**    
Please, tell me.    
    
**Narration:**    
You're...    
    
**Narration:**    
Oh, you're not Persephone.    
What are you?    
    
**Narration:**    
You there, from another planet.    
You're supposed to be my beloved daughter.    

![](https://i.imgur.com/ytvtPDo.png)
    
**Foreign Priestess:**    
Demeter.    
Goddess of the land.    
    
**Foreign Priestess:**    
Now that you know you're about to disappear,    
don't you have any regrets?    

![](https://i.imgur.com/WsQ3kVf.png)
    
**Demeter:**    
...That's very kind of you.    

![](https://i.imgur.com/bQyhBRJ.png)
    
**Demeter:**    
I do have one regret.    
Just one.    

![](https://i.imgur.com/MkCq4B5.png)
    
**Demeter:**    
I can only pray that these new,    
tiny, intelligent beings...    
    
**Demeter:**    
These ten million of my darling Olympians...    
are able to find peace.    

![](https://i.imgur.com/yLhY1sZ.png)
    
**Demeter:**    
I pray that when their time comes...    
they are able to go without suffering.    
    
### She Speaks (2)!    

![](https://i.imgur.com/SNgXWIe.png)
    
**Narration:**    
...I can see the sky.    
    
**Narration:**    
Demeter. Poor Demeter.    
Is this what you saw at your end, too?    
    
**Narration:**    
I can feel my body falling apart, just like hers.    
    
**Narration:**    
I feel myself dying, just like she did.    
    
**Narration:**    
At last, I'll finally get to die. How ironic that    
the last thing I see will be the starry sky.    
    
**Narration:**    
I lost what love I had long ago. I feel...nothing as I look up at that starry sky, even in these final moments.    
    
**Narration:**    
Still, now that I think of it...    
    
**Narration:**    
Caligula... That Proper Human History Heroic Spirit the little moon girl cared for said something interesting.    
    
**Narration:**    
Apparently, I was the ancestor of the founders of a place that became Rome, and loved a man by the name of Anchises.    
    
**Narration:**    
Who is that? Where is that? I have no idea. How could I, having lived in this Lostbelt all my life?    
    
**Narration:**    
The only one I ever loved was Hephaestus.    
I've never even heard of these other things.    
    
**Narration:**    
Still...    
    
**Narration:**    
...it sounds like my Proper Human History    
self's love managed to outlive her.    
    
**Narration:**    
That's so...    

![](https://i.imgur.com/8vMateb.png)
    
**Narration:**    
Aphrodite.    
    
**Narration:**    
Please, tell me.    
    
**Narration:**    
What do you want now?    
You really are foreign, aren't you?    
    
**Narration:**    
Let me guess:    
Did you do the same thing with Demeter?    

![](https://i.imgur.com/ytvtPDo.png)
    
**Foreign Priestess:**    
Aphrodite.    
Goddess of love and beauty.    
    
**Foreign Priestess:**    
Now that you know you're about to disappear,    
don't you have any regrets?    

![](https://i.imgur.com/LzCim3S.png)
    
**Aphrodite:**    
Of course not. Why would I?    
I'm Aphrodite&ndash;a cold, heartless machine.    

![](https://i.imgur.com/VekJzEh.png)
    
**Aphrodite:**    
I'm a device for controlling others. A Spiritron information warfare fighter, and intelligent life-form guidance vessel.    

![](https://i.imgur.com/6v4GxL7.png)
    
**Aphrodite:**    
I'm not as kind as Demeter was,    
so I won't be giving you the kind of answer you want.    
    
**Aphrodite:**    
But you may watch and see how a    
goddess meets her end, if you like.    

![](https://i.imgur.com/VekJzEh.png)
    
**Aphrodite:**    
And to see...what remains...    

![](https://i.imgur.com/LzCim3S.png)
    
**Aphrodite:**    
...after a life of control and arrogance...

### Embarassed Priestess...?  

![](https://i.imgur.com/DebAFcP.png)  
    
**Senji Muramasa:**    
Well, see you 'round.    
Don't forget to give my regards to the Chaldea kid.    

![](https://i.imgur.com/3i5kxPT.png)
   
**Musashi:**    
...Uh, yeah, will do.    
Take care.    
    
**Musashi:**    
...Wait. You mean you're leaving right this second!?    

![](https://i.imgur.com/2smra10.png)
    
**Senji Muramasa:**    
Aye. Rasputin's supervising the Crypters, and Ashi&ndash;I mean, Limbo's is to keep an eye on the Lostbelt kings...    
    
**Senji Muramasa:**    
...but my job doesn't really begin until    
this Foreign God guy actually shows up.    
    
**Senji Muramasa:**    
Apparently, I'm supposed to be their butler or something. Anyway, if I'm going to do that job right, I can't go letting myself get defeated now.    
    
**Senji Muramasa:**    
In the meantime, might as well work    
on getting the big god some clothes.    
    
**Senji Muramasa:**    
'Cause if what they say is true,    
they're gonna arrive here buck naked!

**Musashi:**    
!?    
    
**Senji Muramasa:**    
Don't worry, she's just here as an arbiter. She can't do    
anything to you, and she wouldn't even if she could.    
    
### An Attempted Message    

![](https://i.imgur.com/j8IesXJ.png)
    
---    
    
**Fujimaru 1:**    
What's this place...?    
    
---    

![](https://i.imgur.com/jh0Y13B.png)
   
**Holmes:**    
A table that differs significantly from Olympian design... Seven chairs... A modern-day magical circuit in the room...    
    
**Holmes:**    
It seems most likely that this    
is the Crypters' meeting room.    
    
**Holmes:**    
I expect this is where Kirschtaria    
and the other Crypters&ndash;Hm?    
    
**Mechanical Voice:**    
Attention, my fellow Crypters evacuating to Olympia Dodona.    
    
**Mechanical Voice:**    
If you're hearing this, Zeus has fallen to Chaldea,    
and the Tree of Emptiness now belongs solely to me.    
    
**Mechanical Voice:**    
The moment is at hand. The Tree of Emptiness's stored magical energy has reached a critical point.    
    
**Mechanical Voice:**    
Now that my Tree of Emptiness,    
Atlas, is about to fully bloom...    
    
**Mechanical Voice:**    
...our contest to grow our Lostbelts and determine the next course of human history is over, and I've won.    
    
**Mechanical Voice:**    
I only hope that you're all still    
alive to hear this.    
    
**Mechanical Voice:**    
I'm sure you have many thoughts, but I hope you can accept the new world that will soon be upon us. Farewell.    

![](https://i.imgur.com/iIK0OiA.png)
    
**Mash:**    
That was Kirschtaria! Then that corridor must be    
the one that leads to the Tree of Emptiness!

**Foreign Priestess:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/Dcu4lN7.png)

Huh!? Master, the woman we saw in the Russian Lostbelt    
is standing in front of the corridor&ndash;

**Macarios:**    
Huh? What are you talking about, Mash?    
There's no one near the corridor.    
    
**Adele:**    
Macarios is right. There's no magical energy there, either. Are you okay? Are you sure you're not just exhausted?    

![](https://i.imgur.com/7REEW6x.png)
   
**Mash:**    
Huh? But...I can see her right there, plain as day...    
    
---    
    
**Fujimaru 1:**    
...I guess this means the twins can't see her?    
    
---    
    
**Fujimaru 2:**    
Come to think of it, our instruments couldn't observe her in Russia, either...    
    
---    

![](https://i.imgur.com/jh0Y13B.png)
    
**Holmes:**    
Perhaps she wishes to tell us something, or perhaps she's some kind of random phenomenon.    
    
**Holmes:**    
Regardless, we have no time to deal with her now. As it seems she won't be getting in our way, it may be best if we moved on and ignored her.    
    
---    
    
**Fujimaru 1:**    
...Yeah. I guess you're right...    
    
---    
    
**Fujimaru 2:**    
...Okay. Come on, Mash.

**Macarios:**    
Forget about the invisible girl and come on!    
We're almost at the end of this!    
    
**Macarios:**    
What're you scared of at this point!? This guy completely kicked your asses in Atlantis, right?    
    
**Macarios:**    
Don't you want to return the favor this time!?    
    
---    
    
**Fujimaru 1:**    
...Yeah. You're right. Right now, I'm just going to focus on Kirschtaria!

**Mash:**    
R-right! Well said, Master!    

![](https://i.imgur.com/clsbaza.png)

I'm so sorry.    
I wish I knew what it is you want to tell us.    
    
**Mash:**    
Next time, I'll make sure to hear what you    
have to say, but right now, I have to go!

Hmm. You know, even I can never    
tell what it is you're thinking.    
    
**Priest:**    
Tell me, Priestess, did you want to stop them,    
or did you want to kill them here and now?

**Foreign Priestess:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/yHGezVg.png)
    
**Priest:**    
I see. It goes without saying, does it? Then, as I    
suspected, you simply don't care one way or the other.    
    
**Priest:**    
Understood. In that case, I won't interfere    
with their battle either.    
    
**Priest:**    
Perhaps Kirschtaria's inhuman resolution    
and unshakable willpower will prevail...    
    
**Priest:**    
Perhaps it will be the daring and unpredictable Chaldeans, who carry the fate of humanity on their shoulders...    
    
**Priest:**    
Or...perhaps our luck will prevail over them both,    
even after making enemies of everyone.    

![](https://i.imgur.com/gjB4TPr.png)
    
**Priest:**    
Regardless of what happens, as a lone priest,    
I will simply watch and see...    
    
**Priest:**    
...what form the Foreign God's own truth will take.

**Narration:**  
Several Hours after the Meeting  
At the Emptied Throne Room

**Morgan:**  
...Still no sign of movement from the pit.  
That is concerning.  

**Morgan:**  
That aside... A great calamity that comes every thousand years, hmm?  

**Morgan:**  
The sheer idiocy of these faeries never ceases to amaze.  

**Morgan:**  
At least it is useful. I will use whatever I must to erase Proper Human History forever.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/36NM5KC.png)

**Foreign Priestess:**  
...  

**Morgan:**  
...You again. You know that merely observing will resolve nothing.  

**Morgan:**  
If you are truly the Foreign God's priestess, you should at least try to kill me.  

**Morgan:**  
Though of course, that assassination attempt by the Disciple of the Foreign God did not go so well for him.  

**Morgan:**  
No Servant comprised of a Heroic Spirit from Proper Human History can hope to match my Tam Lin.  

**Morgan:**  
If you will do nothing but stand there and watch, then do not show yourself. I tire of looking at you.  

**Morgan:**  
If there is something you wish to say it to me, then speak, as he did.

**The Chaldean:**  
Sorry to interrupt your chat. I would have knocked, but there's no door here.  

**Morgan:**  
Of course not. Why would I welcome guests merely because they come knocking? I do have a waiting room, though, had you cared to use it.  

**The Chaldean:**  
You mean the ghost ward down below? It is majestic but unnecessary. I don't have time to wait.

**Da Vinci:**  
Hang on, Percival. What's this picture up on that wall?  

![](https://i.imgur.com/iHIBTbA.png)

**Percival:**  
Picture? ...Oh, that's a mural that was painted during the Fae Era. None of us really know much about it, though.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/cCbO2Bk.png)

**Artoria:**  
Is that...six faeries dancing around a large beast?  
It almost looks like they're holding a festival.  

**Artoria:**  
But I've never seen any beast like that in Britain before.  

**Senji Muramasa:**  
Looks like some kinda monster to me. Maybe a personification of the calamities.  

**Gareth:**  
Nnn, I don't know if I agree with that. The beast almost looks like it loves them.  

**Habetrot:**  
I think so, too. You probably can't feel it 'cause you're a Proper Human History Heroic Spirit, Muramasa, but this beast is definitely depicted as very loving.  

**Habetrot:**  
No British faerie would be afraid of this mural.  
If anything, I think it'd be seen as...grand.  

**Senji Muramasa:**  
Huh? Because I'm a Proper Human History Heroic Spirit?  

**Da Vinci:**  
...Grand, huh?  

**Da Vinci:**  
I can't tell how it feels to Gareth and Habetrot since I'm not a faerie myself...  

**Da Vinci:**  
...but this wouldn't happen to be a religious painting, would it, Percival?  

**Percival:**  
A... “religious” painting?  
I'm sorry, I don't know what that word means.  

**Percival:**  
All I know is that this mural originally belonged to the faeries of Orkney&ndash;the Rain clan.  

**Percival:**  
It's said that a knight of Londinium brought it here from the ruins of Orkney...  

**Percival:**  
...while Londinium was still being constructed.  

**Percival:**  
Apparently, it depicts the creation of Britain,  
and in old faerie language, it's known as...  

**Percival:**  
“The Abyssal Worm.”

**Fujimaru 1:**  
The Abyssal Worm...

**Fujimaru 2:**  
A worm? Even though it looks like a huge beast?

**Percival:**  
Is something wrong, Fujimaru?  
Did you see someone suspicious over there?

**Fujimaru 1:**  
...(It felt like I was being watched...)

**Fujimaru 2:**  
...It's nothing. Just my imagination.

![](https://i.imgur.com/FOn6J6p.png)

**Senji Muramasa:**  
Hey, Da Vinci. You said this was a religious painting, right? You mean you think it's a god?  

![](https://i.imgur.com/WoYU1wk.png)

**Da Vinci:**  
...Yeah, it probably is.  

**Da Vinci:**  
The six faeries shown here are obviously stand-ins for the six clans&ndash;probably the original forefathers.  

**Da Vinci:**  
And whatever that big thing is, they're clearly worshiping it.  

**Da Vinci:**  
That has to mean this creature stands above the faeries, which would make it a god.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/Dg9zxqx.png)

**Oberon:**  
Hmm. But the thing is, there ARE no gods in Faerie Britain. Like I said, the great cathedral is only for show.  

**Oberon:**  
I've been to almost every city in Britain looking for information, and I've never seen another mural like that.  

**Da Vinci:**  
That's my point. This mural's been around since before Morgan's rule. Hell, it's been around since before Faerie Britain was even a thing.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/3K6OBG6.png)

**Gareth:**  
Oh! So, it's depicting something from the Fae Era, before it became the Era of the High Queen!  

**Gareth:**  
Wait. Then, does that mean...Queen Morgan doesn't know about this mural?  

![](https://i.imgur.com/3jtMD06.png)

**Senji Muramasa:**  
Naw, she must. And, it's probably no accident that it was left out of the history books.  

**Senji Muramasa:**  
Once Morgan became queen, she wanted to be the only power the faeries believed in...  

**Senji Muramasa:**  
So she erased the concept of godhood from Britain by pretending it never existed. That way, it could never pose a threat to her rule.  

**Da Vinci:**  
...It may just be that this mural holds part of the answer as to what causes the calamities...  

**Da Vinci:**  
...and why there are no gods in Britain.  

**Da Vinci:**  
Too bad the only words on it are written in Old Faerian. I can't make heads or tails of it.  

**Da Vinci:**  
Can you read it, Oberon?  

**Da Vinci:**  
Here, look. This part here definitely looks like writing.

**Oberon:**  
...I'm sorry, but no.  

**Oberon:**  
I can kind of read the modern faerie language now, but this is beyond me.  

**Oberon:**  
I'd guess the only people who can read this are in Camelot's administration.  

**Da Vinci:**  
I see. Well, that's too bad.

**Mash:**   
This is&mdash; Just what is this place&mdash;

**Kadoc:**   
An operating room, and...some kind of life form, or&mdash;a corpse...?

By the look of things, this person was&mdash;

**Kadoc:**   
...Yeah. Seems like this being was the Master of every Servant who was in the Singularity.   
  
**Kadoc:**   
Moriarty called it “Subject: E”.   
  
**Mash:**   
Oh! I'm sorry, my mind went blank. Commencing data collection for the surrounding area!   
  
**Kadoc:**   
I'll do the same. We mustn't leave any stone unturned. I'll check for any signs of magical energy or spells that might be in effect.   
  
**Kadoc:**   
I wouldn't hold my breath, though... Modern equipment of this grade wouldn't share the room with magecra&mdash;

**Kadoc:**   
Don't scare me half to death by yelling all of a sudden! But then again, that look on your face is one I know all too well by now!   
  
**Kadoc:**   
Damn, there's no denying something's amiss. Wrap up the scans, Mash!   
  
**Mash:**   
Right! Just ten more seconds until I've measured and recorded all available information in this space!   
  
**Kadoc:**   
Good, the door is still open! Let's head out the moment Mash's scans are complete!   
  
**Kadoc:**   
Fujimaru! Get over here too&mdash;   
  
**Kadoc:**   
Why are you trying to bring the corpse with you!? Don't go touching things you don't know about, you colossal moron!

Hey, that was a precious sample...!

Never mind, nothing we can do about it! Are you feeling abnormal in any way!? No? Great!

I will take my repose first. I have a great deal of new information to digest this cycle.

**U-Olga Marie:**   
&mdash;   

![](https://i.imgur.com/b1GDX9W.png)
  
**Mash:**   
U-Olga Marie is watching the night sky about twenty meters from us.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Good timing. It's a snub to her, but let's clear things up.  
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Let's talk about how to deal with U-Olga Marie as well as the future of our operation from here.   
  
**Mash:**   
What are you thinking regarding U-Olga Marie, Senpai?   
  
**Mash:**   
The situation is that she's currently suffering from amnesia, only remembering her name and purpose.   
  
**Mash:**   
“U-Olga Marie is a space alien who has come to rule the Earth.”   
  
**Mash:**   
“She has no other personal memories. Only the video records she had watched to understand Earth.”   
  
**Mash:**   
...She's ignorant about Chaldea, about the bleaching of Earth, and about her fight with the Storm Border.   
  
**Mash:**   
I don't...want us to be enemies, even if she is the Alien God.   
  
**Mash:**   
She's been friendly to us these past twelve hours. In which case, if she still doesn't regain her memories...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...We'll keep quiet for now about her being the Alien God.  
  
  
---  

![](https://i.imgur.com/U9Uke5g.png)
  
**Nemo Marine:**   
It feels manipulative, but I agree with that. U keeps saying over and over that she's ruling the Earth.   
  
**Nemo Marine:**   
But the nuance is less about “dominating” mankind and more “improving its management”.   
  
**Nemo Marine:**   
That's different from when she was attacking the Storm Border as the Alien God.   
  
**Nemo Marine:**   
I bet she was putting up a facade back then and this is her natural self. So then&mdash;   
  
**Habetrot:**   
She at least won't be the enemy if she can't remember that she's the Alien God, right?   

![](https://i.imgur.com/L5sYuT4.png)
  
**Habetrot:**   
In that case, I'm with you. But you have to promise one thing.   
  
**Habetrot:**   
Let's not hold back anything else. Real friends don't keep each other in the dark about everything.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That goes without saying!  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Now that our minds are made up

**Fujimaru 1:**

**Fujimaru 2:**

**U-Olga Marie:**   
What is it? I've been rather occupied coming up with a presidential astrological sign.   

![](https://i.imgur.com/Pyy87HZ.png)
  
**Mash:**   
E-Excuse us, that is quite a lot of work! I think it's quite romantic to come up with constellations!   

![](https://i.imgur.com/hYEcqbz.png)
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
The first thing to do when reaching a new celestial body is play at constellations. That's a noble's prerogative, but no matter.   
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
If you want to talk, then talk. I'm sure it's a subject that will gratify me.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...And that about sums up our background.  
  
  
---  
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
Servants, Masters, magi, Chaldea and the Human Order Incineration, Singularities...   
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
The bleaching of Earth, Crypters, Fantasy Trees, Pan-Human History, Lostbelts, Earth's many crises...   
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
Hm. Hmm. Now I clearly see the follies of mankind. You have endured much.   

![](https://i.imgur.com/ISy81FV.png)
 
**U-Olga Marie:**   
Although&mdash;you did well restoring your future, even if only once.   
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
I see you in a better light now, Fujimaru. Excellent job, Mash.   
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
Chaldea is quite the organization.   
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
Ensuring a future for the people without them even realizing it&mdash;truly a noble job to perform.   

![](https://i.imgur.com/PrF2mwr.png)
 
**Mash:**   
Director&mdash;   
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
What is the meaning of this “die-recter” talk?   
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
Do your kind tend to suffer from bugs that make you spit out nonsense?   
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
No&ndash;That's not what I should be saying. Right. About your whole story, it's a 90 out of 100.   

![](https://i.imgur.com/XBNGWrV.png)
 
**U-Olga Marie:**   
I've never heard anything more gratifying, but it's a 90. Do you understand why?   
  
**Mash:**   
N-No, I wouldn't know. Have you ever felt all the way gratified?   
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
I mean, it's missing something. You see?   
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
Though I will concede that the both of you gave your all.   
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
But it's missing one piece of the puzzle. It's well-crafted but that one finishing touch isn't there.   
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
It could be even better with one light of hope filling that hole. Though I won't say what would that be. I have no idea who would fit that description.   
  
**Mash:**   
Ah&mdash;!

Heh! Mankind is deducted 100 foolishness points from that remark alone!

After hearing it, I'll help you with your work to save the Earth. Count on me fighting by your side, as friends!

Well, it seems to be getting late despite our glad enthusiasm. I think it's time we get into our sleeping bags.   
  
**Mash:**   
Tepeu said that the sun should take about half the daytime hours to arrive.   
  
**Mash:**   
A rough conversion of that interval ought to be about twelve hours.   
  
**Mash:**   
So after seven hours of solid rest, we'll leave the maize field while it's still night.

That's not a very cheerful color... The green without a trace of stagnation has ripples forming on it.   
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
Do you believe we should not head for Mexico City? It appears to be the capital of the Ocelomeh.   
  
**Tepeu:**   
No, I have no objections with their plan. It is only logical to aid your comrades.   
  
**Tepeu:**   
Though I do feel unease at having to cross the Second Underworld.   
  
**U-Olga Marie:**   
Then why?   

![](https://i.imgur.com/v0oYc08.png)
  
**Tepeu:**   
...I wonder?   
  
**Tepeu:**   
It's just like Marine said, these Marines are no different from him.   
  
**Tepeu:**   
They're just like us. The loss of an individual deinos has no bearing on the deinos species as a whole.   
  
**Tepeu:**   
The entities known as the Marines are still extant. They haven't been lost. And yet&mdash;   
  
**Tepeu:**   
I feel extremely sad...   
  
**Tepeu:**   
I will never again be admonished by THAT Marine, will I?

You are headed for Mexico City to rescue your comrades. I shall be accompanying you, to the best of my ability, as your guide.

What about U-Olga Marie? You have achieved your initial objective.

Alright, let's resume our rescue efforts! Our objective lies on the fifth layer, at Mexico City!

Oh, if it isn't Fujimaru and Mash. Have you come to speak about Pan-Human History again?   
  
**Calm Deinos:**   
That would be wonderful. Come to the center of the circle. This time, please tell us about Central America.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Sorry. I'm not really in the mood to talk right now...  
  
**Disappointed Deinos:**   
Is that so? That does happen sometimes. It can be very difficult to describe events with words alone.   
  
**Disappointed Deinos:**   
A slight mistake in either expression or depiction, and the whole imagery is ruined.   
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Why is nobody upset about this?  
  
**Deinos tilting their head:**   
...? Did something happen that we should be angry about? Ah, that's right, Vucub was imprisoned.   
  
**Deinos tilting their head:**   
We didn't want to do that to one of our own, but we referred to what Pan-Human History used to do.   
  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**   
...Um, what are the deinos going to do now?   
  
**Mash:**   
You know the sun is going to explode, right? What's more, all your friends and your city will be destroyed...   
  
**Mash:**   
And your city's destruction was because of Daybit... no, because of the knowledge of Pan-Human History.   
  
**Mash:**   
Holding us responsible would be entirely justified. So why&mdash;   

![](https://i.imgur.com/UE5rnHw.png)
  
**Assembled Deinos:**   
Hey! What are you doing, Chitam!? You making Mash cry!? That's not cool!

Did you show her your messed-up equation?

I didn't mean to bring the both of you so down... I see...   

![](https://i.imgur.com/dhqOclb.png)
  
**Smiling Deinos:**   
The brain patterns the two of you are experiencing right now most likely corresponds to “guilt.”   
  
**Smiling Deinos:**   
This is not the first time you have worried about this. You asked if we harbored any hostility towards Pan-Human History.   

![](https://i.imgur.com/PpeCTIM.png)
  
**Smiling Deinos:**   
We were delighted when you asked us that.   
  
**Smiling Deinos:**   
It was proof that you always paid special attention to the state of things in a Lostbelt even while fighting them, and have never forgotten them.   

![](https://i.imgur.com/UE5rnHw.png)
  
**Assembled Deinos:**   
Yes, that's right. But it was hard on you, wasn't it?   
  
**Assembled Deinos:**   
You linger on those painful memories, despite doing it six times over, right?   
  
**Assembled Deinos:**   
It would have been easier to forget them each time. But you don't, and it's thanks to that that stories exist in Pan-Human History.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Stories exist—because we don't want to forget things?

![](https://i.imgur.com/cKazBjS.png)
  
**Calm Deinos:**   
Yes. That's the biggest difference between us and Pan-Human History.   
  
**Calm Deinos:**   
We have no history. No stories. That's why we can accept extinction as a daily routine.   
  
**Calm Deinos:**   
Because we don't record it as a bad thing.

**Mash:**   
Um...everyone, could you...   
  
**Mash:**   
It might be somewhat rude to ask this, but...   
  
**Mash:**   
Is it not that Tepeu was particularly special in his comprehension, but all the deinos...   

![](https://i.imgur.com/cKazBjS.png)
  
**Calm Deinos:**   
Have the same brain structure and level of intelligence? Yes, that's the case.   
  
**Calm Deinos:**   
There aren't any “geniuses” or “special individuals” among the deinos, or any individual differences either.   
  
**Calm Deinos:**   
What makes Tepeu different from us isn't how he thinks, but how his perception of things is affected by his physical makeup.   
  
**Calm Deinos:**   
All the deinos understood when we heard you say that Mictlan was a Lostbelt&mdash;a fantasy.   
  
**Calm Deinos:**   
What's more, we were enthralled by your tales. At the same time, it felt desolate.   

![](https://i.imgur.com/piWK6jB.png)
  
**Laughing Deinos:**   
I thought they were great! I want to try swimming in Atlantis!
