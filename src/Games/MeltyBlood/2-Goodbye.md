#### *Atlas Institute*  
  
----  
  
"Sion Eltnam Sokaris.   
  
Hereby decreed as candidate for Academy Director."  
  
----  
  
The grim face of the university president reading the edict.   
  
The students and the teachers look at each other, wide-eyed.   
  
Unhushed whispers rise and hundreds of eyes face me.  
  
Surprise. I'm astonished, I never would have thought it.   
  
Blame. Unforgivable.   
  
Denial. I can't believe it.   
  
Other words I can't make out, blending together into sounds as arcane as the syllables of a spell.  
  
----  
  
"Henceforth, Sion Eltnam will be Sion Eltnam Atlasia.   
  
She will be accorded the privileges and respect of an instructor and have the same status as ambassador-at-large."  
  
----  
  
The words of the university president are absolute.   
  
Not just because of the authority of his position, but because the words make it clear it is a command.   
  
There is no protest from the audience, only more glares directed at me.  
  
----  
  
"────"  
  
It's not as though I've suddenly changed.   
  
Of all those gathered in the great hall, only the university president and I seem calm.   
  
As for everyone else──the students and even the teachers are dumbfounded with surprise.  
  
I suppose it is natural.   
  
I am now Sion Eltnam Atlasia.   
  
Those given the name of Atlas are chosen to represent this Academy.   
  
No one guessed that out of all the students and faculty, it would be an Eltnam.  
  
----  
  
"────────"  
  
Of course, I was calm.   
  
Not that I was informed beforehand I would be given the name Atlasia.   
  
Simply that among the Atlas Association, I was the only one with the requisite power.   
  
Instead of being surprised, it was rather natural to be bored.  
  
----  
  
...... Just what has changed in my life since then?   
  
I do not look any different in the mirror.   
  
Since I was an Eltnam, a once-noble house, the others treated me with contempt.  
  
I excelled as a student to erase the sin of my ancestor.   
  
The others wanted only to have me removed.   
  
As long as I was the top student in the class, all they could do was ignore me.   
  
Once I became Atlasia, I had the power to remove them.  
  
----  
  
They were afraid of my retribution.   
  
They probably believed I would treat them in the same manner they treated me.   
  
They did not want to receive any contempt.  
  
I am a noble.   
  
The blood of the sinner Eltnam runs through me, but I am not ruled by my emotions.   
  
In the first place, I do not feel any emotions towards them anyway.  
  
----  
  
If they wished to distance me, then I will keep them distant.   
  
That will not change from before.   
  
I do not need anyone, so I do not need to associate with them.   
  
I already had the needed laboratory, so I just continued to excel in my studies.  
  
----  
  
It was eight years ago.   
  
What was correct? What was mistaken?  
  
────Even now I don't really know for certain.  
  
----  
  
#### *Misaki at night*  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "...... Not good. It's already this late."  
  
I open my eyes.   
  
Was it because I was so exhausted?   
  
I saw a meaningless dream.  
  
No, because I was dreaming, you could say I was not completely exhausted.   
  
If my mind were truly burdened, I would not have seen anything.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "...... Probably because of overexertion during the day. There is something wrong with this much heat."  
  
I had heard that Japanese summers were hot, but I had not thought it would be this bad.   
  
The heat shining back from this town is too strong even for me, a child of the desert.  
  
----  
  
I thought I would sleep through the heat of the day, but it seems I could not control the time of my awakening.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "...... A cold night. I must have slept too long?"  
  
Whatever the case, confusion is for certain.   
  
Not sleeping properly and not ordering all this information is setting myself up for failure.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "...... But before that, I must confirm where the next incident will occur."  
  
As long as I can move, I must finish the preparations.  
  
Fortunately, I have data on this town I downloaded from Tohno Shiki.   
  
I can find the source of all these incidents without needless roaming.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Ah, come to think of it...... Tohno Shiki. Securing him is also a priority."  
  
It is before midnight.   
  
There are three possible routes he will take.  
  
It should be easy enough to determine his current location.  
  
----  
  
#### *Location changes to the Shrine*  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "...... Then, all that's left is this?"  
  
I come out to an unfamiliar clearing.   
  
A small clearing apart from the office buildings.  
  
----  
  
Until a short while ago everything was another large city park but it now transitions into private property.  
  
__Shiki__: "Wow. From down here it really looks impressive."  
  
----  
  
I look up at the building under construction.  
  
I heard the monumental architecture would be finished next spring.   
  
Nobody seems to be sure exactly what it's going to be, but it's something important.  
  
I've heard everything from a big department store to the corporate office of a powerful electronics company.  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "The area around it is also being landscaped. Maybe I don't have to go this far."  
  
The land all around the building is perfectly flat like a mirror.   
  
The name of the building, Shrine, may be appropriate... but it's going a little too far.  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "────Well..."  
  
I hold my breath and scan the area.   
  
No sign of anyone else around.  
  
Of course there are less and less people as night falls, thanks to the rumors of the vampire murders starting up again, but...  
  
----  
  
I can understand why no one would be in the park, or the back alley, but this place is empty of people for another reason.  
  
__Shiki__: "...... Well, after all, this is private property. The only people around would be trespassing, so why should I expect to see anybody......?"  
  
───And then,   
  
I suddenly get assailed by nausea.   
  
My fingers are numb and my throat is parched.  
  
My pulse quickens.   
  
A feeling like poison creeping from the back of my brain.  
  
Without even realizing it, my right hand reaches into my pocket and soundlessly takes out my knife.  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "────This... sensation."  
  
...... I've felt these chills so many times before.   
  
Am I just disposed to this?  
  
Before I meet up with something unworldly, I always get assailed by this sensation.  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "............"  
  
...... I sense someone.   
  
Someone standing right behind me.  
  
Someone (a human?) on this private property where no one should be.   
  
A faint chill.   
  
And...... the vampire has returned────!  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "...... But, something is......"  
  
It feels a little different.   
  
Are my reactions weak?   
  
It simply feels "different from usual", a discomfort that indicates the presence of an outsider.  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "──Well, show yourself......!"  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Hello? Is someone there?"  
  
I speak with my knife hidden behind my back.   
  
───And then,  
  
__Sion__: "Good evening. Do you have business with me?"  
  
Even though it was all so sudden, the girl speaks so calmly.  
  
__Shiki__: "────"  
  
----  
  
Seeing her, I was startled.  
  
That distinctive dress and hat.   
  
Definitely a foreign look, and I'm almost afraid to say it, but she looks really cute.  
  
__Sion__: "What is it?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Oh, ah... well, no, nothing really."  
  
__Shiki__: "Um──Sorry, I mistook you for someone else. Sorry to be so rude."  
  
__Sion__: "You do not have to apologize.   
  
But that is not the way to greet someone, is it?"  
  
----  
  
Her tone is so smooth.   
  
...... Now that she mentions it, it makes total sense.   
  
Lately, I seem to be off-kilter.  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "...... You're right. It's a little late, but, good evening."  
  
__Sion__: "Yes, nice to meet you."  
  
__Sion__: "So, what are you doing here?   
  
Are you looking for something at this hour?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Eh? ...... Ah, yeah, something like that.   
  
And what about you? You couldn't have not heard about how dangerous it is at night──"  
  
----  
  
Oh, right.   
  
If she's a foreigner, she wouldn't have heard the rumors circulating this town.  
  
Since she's probably just sightseeing, she wouldn't know anything about the vampire murders last year, either......  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "It's nothing...... Um, I don't know why you are here, but it's better to not hang around places where no one is around. You never know what might happen."  
  
__Sion__: "────"  
  
----  
  
She just stares at me.   
  
...... It's only natural.   
  
There's no way she can understand me if I keep suddenly blurting out all this stuff.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "No, you cannot say I don't know what will happen. Whatever shape he takes, the vampire will appear. Even you are patrolling in order to find him, are you not, Tohno Shiki?"  
  
__Shiki__: "W────what?"  
  
__Sion__: "You could say we are looking for the same thing, Tohno Shiki. ...... Although our reasons are very different."  
  
----  
  
She speaks devoid of any expression.   
  
Those chills return.   
  
Pain in my temples like a stabbing needle...  
  
__Sion__: "An irregularity like you throws the equation out of balance. Unless I move quickly to root out any problems, the results this time will also be undesirable."  
  
Her arms swings forth and I hear an unfamiliar click.   
  
She holds a black gun in her hand.  
  
__Sion__: "────Please, resist if you wish. My name is Sion Eltnam Atlasia. Your freedom now belongs to me."  
  
And with that, she jumps towards me.   
  
This foreign girl I'd never met before attacks me with almost unspeakable speed.  
  
----  
  
## *Shiki vs Sion*  
  
## *Shiki wins*  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Ahh......"  
  
__Shiki__: "That's enough. I don't know what you're trying to do, but it's meaningless to continue."  
  
__Sion__: "Yes. I admit defeat. Even though I collected all your data I could not finish reading it. ...... Even if everything was walking on a tightrope I can't believe I'm finished before even had a chance to start."  
  
__Shiki__: "..............."  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "What's the matter? I have no strength to resist. This may be a selfish request, but please end it as cleanly as possible."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... Cleanly as possible? Look...... You seem to know something about me, but aren't you making a big mistake here? I'm no killer out for blood. Even if you asked me I wouldn't kill you."  
  
__Sion__: "Not... a killer?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah. I'm not going to hit someone while they're down. I don't have a quarrel with you so there's no need to take it all the way. If you promise you won't attack me I'll let you go. ──You don't look like a vampire anyway."  
  
__Sion__: "...... This is troubling. I may keep quiet, but I will not lie. Therefore I can't promise not to attack you again."  
  
__Shiki__: "Eh? ...... You can't... then you mean... um..."  
  
__Sion__: "That's right. Once my wounds heal, I will bind you."  
  
__Shiki__: "────"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "If you don't like it, then you just have to kill me. For someone like you it would be very easy."  
  
__Shiki__: "......... Idiot, what do you mean, easy?"  
  
__Sion__: "Eh? Did you say something, Tohno Shiki?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah, I said something. I was complaining about being involved in something weird again! ...... For crying out loud, if it's not one thing it's another────"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "────I cannot understand. This seems to be causing you pain."  
  
__Shiki__: "You're the one who isn't understandable. But you don't look like you'll go back on your word."  
  
__Sion__: "Yes. As long as I am not mistaken, I will not change."  
  
__Shiki__: "I see. Your expression speaks for you. (Why do I only meet these kinds of people?)"  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Well, anyway...... Um, can you tell me about your situation? You've been telling me what to do, so maybe you can at least tell me why?"  
  
__Sion__: "...... My situation ... You mean my purpose here?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah. For some reason, you don't seem like a bad person. If you could tell me about your situation, I'll listen... Um, I'm also kind of curious why you attacked me."  
  
__Sion__: "...... I understand. I was told you were not a bad person, and this confirms it. I should have explained the circumstances from the very start, Tohno Shiki."  
  
__Shiki__: "?"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "My goal is to find a cure for vampirism. I have been researching a way to return humans bitten by a vampire back to normal."  
  
__Shiki__: "A cure for vampirism......?"  
  
__Sion__: "Yes. As you know someone who became no longer human after being bitten by a vampire, you can understand, right? The result of someone being desecrated by a vampire is death. Of course, we know how a human could become a vampire, but we don't know if a vampire could return to being a human. Many magi have attempted to research this problem and failed, but I do not intend to. I will make the impossible possible. That is what Atlasia means."  
  
__Shiki__: "..............."  
  
__Sion__: "Tohno Shiki, I believe you can understand how I feel. Like me, you have seen a friend become a vampire before your eyes."  
  
__Shiki__: "───────You seem to know a lot about that."  
  
__Sion__: "Ah...... That was inconsiderate of me. This is upsetting you."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... No, it's okay. I'm just being childish."  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "I understand what you're saying. You want to find a cure for vampirism──I can't hate you for something like that."  
  
__Shiki__: "But why did you attack me? I'm not turning into a vampire, and I don't know a lot about them, either."  
  
__Sion__: "Of course. I did not come here to make you a research specimen. I came to this country to ask the cooperation of the True Ancestor."  
  
__Shiki__: "Eh───True Ancestor, as in Arcueid?"  
  
__Sion__: "Yes. If I want to find a cure for vampirism I have to study the source of Dead Apostles, a True Ancestor. If I merely needed data on the Dead Apostles, The Church has compiled much of that. However, that is insufficient. I need to investigate an unaltered True Ancestor."  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "...... I see. But I'm not sure Arcueid would go for that. She's kind of fickle that way.  
  
__Sion__: "I know that. A noble True Ancestor would not grant the request of a mere mortal. I need you to negotiate for me."  
  
__Shiki__: "Me? Negotiate?"  
  
__Sion__: "(Nod)"  
  
__Shiki__: "Idio-That's not going to work! You think she'd listen to me? Where'd you get an idea like that!?"  
  
__Sion__: "W-well, you... the True Ancestor... aren't the two of you... l-l-lovers?"  
  
__Shiki__: "────"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "With you as a mediator, perhaps I could speak with her a little. That is why I wanted to secure you first...... This is all the result of my carelessness."  
  
__Shiki__: "Wha...... carelessness? You mean before?"  
  
__Sion__: "Yes. I drew in all your data. The numbers indicated we were evenly matched, but my thorough knowledge meant my chances of winning were high. However, my loss means my abilities were the slightest fraction lower."  
  
__Shiki__: "......? Um, then that isn't being careless...... doesn't that just mean your fighting ability is───"  
  
__Sion__: "Wha, what are you sayinggg! I only lost because of carelessness! Excessive carelessness! My performance was far below my standard! I admit I miscalculated your power, but under normal circumstances, I would be the victor! You see, an hour ago, I calculated every single one of your maneuvers. Doesn't this just mean my evasion rate data was off by less than 0.5%!? If not for that one small mistake, our positions would have been completely reversed! Can you not understand such a simple thing!?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Eh───right. Sorry I doubted you."  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Ah...... no, I was being a little rude. I would appreciate it if we just changed the subject."  
  
__Shiki__: "(......Hmm. She seems totally different from before.)  
  
__Shiki__: "To get back to your problem, you really just want me to bring Arcueid to you?"  
  
__Sion__: "Yes. My intent was to formally request the True Ancestor's cooperation."  
  
__Shiki__: "I see. So you won't give up even now? ...... Okay...... if that's the case, oh well."  
  
__Sion__: "? Oh well? What do you mean?"  
  
__Shiki__: "I mean, I can act as a middle man between you and Arcueid. ...... In all likelihood she's going to say no, but you wouldn't give up unless we tried, right?"  
  
__Sion__: "(Nod)"  
  
__Shiki__: "C'mon, it's just asking for cooperation, right? So, I'll lend you a hand. To be honest, I'd like to cheer on someone doing your kind of research."  
  
__Sion__: "Eh......... cheer... on......?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah. Suddenly attacking me out of nowhere was surprising, but we can call it even. ...... If your research is successful, I feel like───I could finally help her."  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: ".................."  
  
__Shiki__: "I'll do something about Arcueid. Actually, I'm looking for her right now. I figured she would know something about these disturbances happening. I went to her place, but───"  
  
__Sion__: "So she has concealed her location."  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah. And by patrolling the town, I thought I'd find the rumored vampire, or at least Her Highness the fickle princess."  
  
__Sion__: "...... I understand. Then I can lend you a hand in your purpose. If you're tracking down the rumors, I can find the vampire more quickly than you can."  
  
__Shiki__: "Eh? Really?"  
  
__Sion__: "Yes, if the rumored vampire does exist. Data gathering is my specialty. If I have at least a backup, I can scan the minds of everyone in this town in one day."  
  
__Shiki__: "───Hmm, I don't really quite understand, but you don't have to go that far, do you?" (...... She has a scary look in her eyes.)  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "But, yeah. I'd appreciate any help. I was feeling kind of hopeless by myself."  
  
__Sion__: "Then I will chase down these rumors. And you?"  
  
__Shiki__: "It's alright if I look for Arcueid and bring her to you isn't it? But, there's one other thing before that."  
  
__Sion__: "Before that?"  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "It's Sion, right? If we're going to be partners, we should call each other by our first names, shouldn't we?"  
  
__Sion__: "─────────────────────"  
  
__Sion__: "You have a point. Very well. You may call me Sion. And you───"  
  
__Shiki__: "Ah, Shiki's fine."  
  
__Sion__: "────────"  
  
__Sion__: "...... Shi-Shiki."  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah. That's much better, isn't it?"  
  
__Sion__: "...... Shiki..."  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah."  
  
__Sion__: "Shiki."  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah, I said that's fine."  
  
__Sion__: ".........................................."  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "............... Then I will go start gathering information on the vampire. Please prepare for the negotiations with the True Ancestor, Shiki."  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah. But we don't have to go right away, you know."  
  
__Sion__: "That would be the best, I think. We'll both need some time. Let's meet again tomorrow night right here, in front of this building."  
  
__Shiki__: "Okay. I think I can manage something by then."  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Shiki. Can you... hold on for a minute?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Eh......? Did I have something on my head?"  
  
__Sion__: "...... Something like that. Well then, see you tomorrow night."  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah, see you tomorrow───Hm. This seems a little familiar. It reminds me of a year ago."  
  
__Sion__: "?"  
  
__Shiki__: "It's nothing. See you tomorrow night, Sion!"  
  
__Sion__: "...... Yes. See you tomorrow night, Shiki."

## The Daughter of Atlas  
  
### Sion Eltnam Atlasia   
  
----  
  
───That night, the air was maddeningly hot.  
  
----  
  
"Water......"  
  
I run, seeking any moisture I could find.   
  
I run through the dark forest.   
  
I run through the hell of the steep mountain pass.   
  
Compared to walking through the familiar deserts of my youth, the mountain path flooded with trees is like walking on needles.  
  
All the knights who had accompanied me are dead.   
  
No one is left alive.   
  
I go back to the village.   
  
All the villagers are dead.   
  
The well is dried up.   
  
The river is filled with corpses.   
  
Still, I crawl my way to it, hoping to find water.  
  
----  
  
"Ah... hah... ah!"  
  
Choking, I drink and drink.   
  
As if I'm brought back to life.   
  
Something feels intertwined.   
  
Like a large cloth, endlessly intertwined.  
  
It's in my way, so I pull at it over and over.   
  
I tear and pull but the cloth still gets in the way.   
  
----  
  
Each time I bend to drink, I get wrapped further inside.   
  
I pull again and the rustling cloth entangles in my fingers.   
  
Again and again.  
  
Rustle.  
  
Rustle. Rustle.  
  
Rustle. Rustle. Rustle.  
  
Rustle. Rustle. Rustle. Rustle.  
  
Rustle. Rustle. Rustle. Rustle. Rustle. Rustle. Rustle.   
  
Rustle............!  
  
Skin. The human corpses shaped into a large sheet. Dead bodies. Empty shells drained of everything inside. The skin of all the hundreds of people pushed in and piled up until the dark and the damp rotted away their skin and it all oozed together into one hideous sheet sheet sheet sheet sheet sheet sheet............!!!!  
  
----  
  
"Ha... ah!"  
  
────Even seeing that, I need water, so I continue to drink.  
  
They get in my way, but I drink anyway.   
  
The cartoon-like faces are actually comical.   
  
Yes, mutilated, fleshless, organ-less.   
  
The seemingly clothed corpses were piled up here.  
  
Everyone was drained.   
  
That vampire drank every last drop of their blood.  
  
───What a nightmare. As if it was a curse.  
  
----  
  
"Atlasia. Even if you're the only one, you have to survive."  
  
The speaker was one of the Knights, the only one I knew.   
  
A Knight of the Shield. A woman.   
  
Just like me. That is why I survived.   
  
Allowed to escape.  
  
She is... definitely────  
  
----  
  
I run along the mountain path.   
  
                I run until dawn.   
                  
        But there is no way out.  
  
               The curse rebounded on itself.   
                 
    Cursing myself, I cannot escape from myself.  
  
                   And before my eyes   
                     
    ───Something appears, black as night.  
  
----  
  
It drinks and drinks.   
  
Filled to the brim, the blood leaks from its eyes.   
  
It is not enough.   
  
However much it drinks, it cannot be sated.  
  
"H... ha... hahahahaha!"  
  
Crying tears of blood, it begins to laugh.

The black eyes draw near.   
  
Drip, drip. The rich red blood continues to flow.

        Something wet and slippery.

And then I wake up.   
  
...... It is still daytime.   
  
Like in my dream, today is stiflingly hot.  
  
----  
  
I think I am not suited for walking around during the day.   
  
In the first place, I spend most of my time indoors as an alchemist.  
  
My skin isn't used to being in the burning sun.  
  
----  
  
All the same, I made a promise.   
  
To him──to Shiki. A promise to gather information on the vampire in his place.

"............ Ah..."  
  
Suddenly, I'm very tired.   
  
My throat is parched and sore, and my tired body collapses in on itself.  
  
"Ha──ah."  
  
----  
  
I expel the air from my lungs.   
  
It's like breathing fire.  
  
----  
  
"Can't...... breathe..."  
  
My vision blurs. If I don't rest... if I don't sleep properly, I won't be able to keep going.   
  
I may only have two or three days left.  
  
----  
  
"But, I can still move."  
  
If I can move, I'm still alive.   
  
I'm still injured from last night's battle, but it won't slow me down.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Ah... I really was careless yesterday, wasn't I?"  
  
I knew about Shiki's abilities.   
  
But I was never clear on his fighting experience.  
  
----  
  
Maybe he only fought on a few occasions, but those were against members of the 27 Ancestors and an agent of The Church.   
  
If he was strong enough to stand against creatures like them, he could hardly consider me to be a real enemy.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "It is a little... regrettable."  
  
......? What was that outburst?   
  
Shiki has already agreed to help me.   
  
There can't be any problem, so what is regrettable?  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "My Etherlite is connected to him. If he tries to back out of our agreement, I can calculate his location easily enough."  
  
After we agreed to cooperate, I touched his head and attached my Etherlite.  
  
----  
  
Not remote control, but direct contact with my Etherlite burrowing into his nervous system.   
  
Therefore────  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "But, that's just in case."  
  
...... I start to feel less and less well.   
  
...... I should stop thinking these extra thoughts.  
  
Anyway, I have to fulfill the promise I made with him.  
  
----  
  
Information collection ended easily enough.   
  
It does seem that most of the citizens have heard of the second coming of the "vampire".   
  
----  
  
But it is only thin rumor, not too different from the information that Shiki knows.  
  
__Sion__: "All the same, no one denies the rumor. Even if the credibility is nonexistent, it is a rumor accepted naturally."  
  
Everyone seems to feel something bad is going to happen.   
  
The emptiness of the town has crept into their hearts.  
  
----  
  
The town will bake in the heat today, and probably tomorrow as well.   
  
The stage is set, a town under attack by fierce heat of record high temperatures.  
  
The spawning of strange paradoxes of unknown origin.   
  
Terrible ideas, ill omens, visits to the temple portending bad luck.  
  
----  
  
Coincidence? The dark night where "uneasiness" fed by anxiety becomes reality.   
  
Even though not one murder has occurred, everyone says it "happened", and the vampire has returned.  
  
----  
  
And.   
  
During the deep night in the empty town, a lurking shadow which wanders the streets.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "...... Soon the moon will form a perfect circle in the sweltering night, which seems itself to be in agony. Until then, I..."  
  
I must guide this loose "rumor" into a definite shape.  
  
----  
  
#### Shrine  
  
----  
  
Sion arrives according to schedule.  
  
__Sion__: "Good evening. You are right on time, Shiki."  
  
__Shiki__: "Same for you. A big difference from someone I know."  
  
...... Actually, she would come extremely early and then go hide.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Shiki. How did things turn out with the True Ancestor?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Well, it can be pretty hard to get hold of her sometimes. But I left a note in her room. Maybe tomorrow will be different..."  
  
__Sion__: "Is that so? So she covers her tracks well. This won't be easy."  
  
__Shiki__: "Right, right. As fickle as she is, she might just have decided to go off and play around for a while without even knowing what's going on."  
  
__Sion__: "Perhaps. Do you not think she left you intentionally, Shiki?"  
  
__Shiki__: "───Intentionally? What do you mean, Sion?"  
  
__Sion__: "I mean that the returned vampire could possibly be the True Ancestor."  
  
Shiki:"That's impossible. Arcueid would never do the kinds of things they're talking about."  
  
__Sion__: "...... Never? You really are a wonderful person, denying it so completely like that, Shiki."  
  
__Shiki__: "Er, well, thanks..."  
  
I stammer a reply.   
  
For some reason, her words don't seem sarcastic, and almost have a ring of admiration to them.  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "A-anyway, Arcueid doesn't drink human blood. You might not know that, Sion, but she───"  
  
__Sion__: "She isn't the vampire in the rumors, right? If you say so."  
  
__Sion__: "However, if the vampire has returned to this town, then isn't it strange that there is no other vampire around besides the True Ancestor? There has to be something which was a model for all these rumors."  
  
__Shiki__: "A model for the rumors......? Wouldn't that be the incident from a year ago?"  
  
__Sion__: "That isn't the model, but the source. The rumors have been very clear about that. No one has actually seen or heard anything themselves. Putting aside what is true or false, does there not have to be some 'shadowy figure wandering the night' on which to base these rumors?"  
  
__Shiki__: "......?"  
  
Sion is a little hard to follow. No, in the first place───  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Sion, I've been wondering. You talk about research and studying vampires... who exactly are you?"  
  
__Sion__: "I am an alchemist. You know about magi, do you not? The one named Ciel belongs to The Church, but there is another organization called the Mage's Association."  
  
__Sion__: "I am a member of the Mage's Association. There are three separate branches. I belong to Atlas."  
  
__Sion__: "The Church views vampires as their enemy, but they have an agreement with us, the Mage's Association. ...... You could say we're a military force that isn't black, but not white either."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... Mage's Association......"  
  
...... Hmm. If that's the case then maybe Sensei is also in this Association.   
  
Maybe Sion even knows her.  
  
__Sion__: "I do not. Your Sensei is London's problem child, so it is natural for a member of Atlas like me to not have met her."  
  
__Shiki__: "W-what did you say, Sion? How did you..."  
  
__Sion__: "I can tell what you're thinking. You're someone whose face is easily read."  
  
...... Hmph.   
  
I'm used to Akiha and the others saying that, but it is a bit of a shock to hear it from Sion, whom I've just met.  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "...... Whatever. Then what do we do from here? It isn't fair if you don't tell me the results on all the information you gathered before."  
  
__Sion__: "I don't mind. But what I gathered was not really any different than the rumors you heard. So I have nothing to tell you."  
  
__Shiki__: "My. That's a little troubling."  
  
__Sion__: "Isn't it? So now we will just have to confirm it with our own eyes after all. If we're going to find the rumored vampire and the source behind it, we have to search the city at night."  
  
...... So we're back to that. I didn't expect anything better.   
  
This reminds me more and more of what happened last year.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "So...... This is my plan, Shiki. Why don't we look together? I don't know this town very well. I would be wasting my time without a guide.  
  
__Shiki__: "Eh? ...... Well, they say two heads are better than one but is it alright? Your purpose is to research vampires, so......"  
  
__Sion__: "We cannot declare for certain the source of these rumors isn't the True Ancestor, correct? Reason stands that if we fulfill your goal, it would be easier to find the True Ancestor. It would be meaningless if only I found the True Ancestor, and you would become free much quicker. I think that goes without saying."  
  
__Shiki__: "────"  
  
I see, that's what she's thinking.   
  
Well, we'll see, I guess.  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Alright. Give-and-take, then."  
  
__Sion__: "Yes. As much as I can, I will help you with your agenda."  
  
----  
  
#### Park  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "We've walked so far and still we haven't found anything. The town is strangely quiet, but there's no odd feeling to the air."  
  
__Sion__: "We haven't gone into the areas mentioned in the rumors. I hate to say this, but more victims will appear as time passes."  
  
__Shiki__: "Huh? Sion, what do────"  
  
__Shiki__: "Whoa!"  
  
__???__: "Halt!"  
  
__Shiki__: "Who────!?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Se...... Sen, pai......?"  
  
__Ciel__: "Tohno-kun......!? Wh-why are you with her──"  
  
__Ciel__: "──Sion Eltnam. Don't tell me, you..."  
  
__Sion__: "I think you misunderstand, agent. I asked for Shiki's help, so he accompanied me."  
  
__Sion__: "No one forced him. As for what you're thinking about, no."  
  
__Ciel__: "...... Is that so? So he has nothing to do with you, then. So you won't ask for his help when we fight."  
  
__Sion__: "────"  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Se, Senpai, hold on! This may look like something is going on, but you don't have to bring out your Black Keys like that all of a sudden."  
  
__Ciel__: "Tohno-kun please be quiet! ...... Goodness, why do you always show up in these bothersome situations? Or is it that you can't resist the request of a cute girl?"  
  
__Shiki__: "T-that's definitely not it!"  
  
__Ciel__: "At any rate, stand aside, Tohno-kun. I will not listen any longer. If you get in my way, prepare to be punished."  
  
__Ciel__: "Sion Eltnam Atlasia. An order has been issued by The Church to take you into protective custody, or failing that, to capture you by any means necessary. A similar request has been issued by the Atlas Institute. Do you have anything to say in your defense?"  
  
__Sion__: "──I have nothing to say. But I will not let you capture me. If you try, you will be destroyed."  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah, saying that all of a sudden is a little── W-wait, Sion... What did you just say!?"  
  
__Ciel__: "You will not comply with The Church's orders? Very well, then. As an agent of The Church, I am placing you under arrest."  
  
__Ciel__: "I will make you reflect on your actions. Your partner will also have quite the painful experience."  
  
__Shiki__: "Uwaaa! Senpai, why are you getting so serious!?"  
  
----  
  
## *Sion/Shiki vs Ciel*  
  
## *Sion/Shiki lose*  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Ah............!"  
  
__Shiki__: "────!"  
  
__Ciel__: "You certainly gave me a good fight, but this is the end of the line."  
  
__Ciel__: "Sion Eltnam. You are under arrest by order of The Church. Any further resistance will be dangerous to your health."  
  
__Sion__: "Kk........."  
  
__Shiki__: "No, please wait, Senpai! Sion is just trying to find a cure for vampirism. I don't know everything that is going on, but it would be wrong to take her away forcefully......!"  
  
__Ciel__: "You are the one who is wrong. The charge against Sion Eltnam is no small matter."  
  
__Ciel__: "───Sion. You don't want to get innocent civilians mixed up in this. Return to Atlas quietly."  
  
__Sion__: "...... I cannot do that. Disappearing quietly is your style, agent."  
  
__Ciel__: "Foolishness. You mean to continue your useless resistance?"  
  
__Sion__: "Yes. If you come near me again, I can't guarantee Shiki's safety."  
  
__Ciel__: "Huh?"  
  
__Shiki__: "What?"  
  
__Ciel__: "W... what?"  
  
__Shiki__: "...... What do you mean by that?"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Just what I said. Ciel, if you do not leave at once, I will burn up Shiki's brain."  
  
__Sion__: "The artificial nervous system implanted in Shiki, my Etherlite, is connected to me through my bracelet. I can destroy his brain at any time if you do not agree to leave me alone."  
  
__Ciel__: "Etherlite...... I've heard of that before. I thought it sounded familiar, but the name Eltnam is related to that man... typical of Atlas. I'll accept this temporarily."  
  
__Sion__: "You should not speak of knowledge gained from Roa. I am different from that man you speak of."  
  
__Sion__: "But, we are getting ahead of ourselves. This Etherlite is connected to Shiki's brain. Before you could stop me, his brain would be fried."  
  
__Shiki__: "Sion, you......"  
  
__Ciel__: "...... I see. So you enlisted him for purposes of using him as a hostage all along."  
  
__Sion__: "Of course. He's my bargaining chip with the forces in this town."  
  
__Ciel__: "───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────"  
  
----  
  
__Ciel__: "...... *sigh* If you are willing to go that far, then it cannot be helped. Sorry, Tohno−kun. Please try and make the best of a bad situation."  
  
__Sion__: "────!"  
  
__Shiki__: "Eh────Um, Senpai?"  
  
__Ciel__: "You agreed to cooperate with Sion Eltnam, so you brought this on yourself. Well, it is probably good policy to stay in the good graces of the one who could fry your brain, Tohno−kun."  
  
__Shiki__: "Uwaaa, Senpai, you've really said it now!"  
  
__Sion__: "............"  
  
__Ciel__: "───It would be easy if it was this simple, though. Unfortunately, I cannot believe all of that, Sion Eltnam."  
  
__Ciel__: "Certainly you would turn him into a vegetable if I tried anything. No matter what I did, I could not stop you."  
  
__Ciel__: "However, it would not be anything that could not be healed. After I brought you down, I could simply heal him."  
  
__Ciel__: "...... But, your control over him is different. I cannot win as long as Tohno−kun is restrained. In the worst case, I could not even escape."  
  
__Sion__: "─────"  
  
----  
  
__Ciel__: "It's not impossible for us to start over here. Certainly I received an order to arrest Sion Eltnam, but it is just one of many orders. My priority mission is to deal with the Dead Apostle that is hiding somewhere in this town. I can deal with your case after that mission is over."  
  
__Shiki__: "The Dead Apostle hiding in this town...... Senpai, so you are looking into the rumored vampire after all!?"  
  
__Ciel__: "The Church has decided to investigate, and the job of eliminating it has fallen to me. That mission takes precedence over her arrest. However, do not think there will be a second time... I will not let you off next time."  
  
__Ciel__: "Okay? By then, please cut your ties with her. ...... Really, Tohno−Kun, even though you already have so many loose ends, you voluntarily stick your neck out for even more......"  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Senpai───seems to have let us go."  
  
__Sion__: "A wise move. If she tried to force the issue, the cost in terms of time and effort would be greatly damaging to efficiency."  
  
__Shiki__: "────"  
  
__Sion__: "What is it, Shiki? You seem like you wish to say something."  
  
__Shiki__: "Sion. Was what you said really true? You're connected to my head?"  
  
__Sion__: "It is not exactly like that. The Etherlite, the artificial nervous system, is simply linked with your nervous system. It will not cause any problems with your brain."  
  
__Shiki__: "That's not what I meant. Why did you do that?"  
  
__Sion__: "I did it so I could locate you when I needed you. And to get information from you."  
  
__Shiki__: "And what about your threat? Could you really burn out my brain?"  
  
__Sion__: "Yes. It would take some work, but the chances of success are very high."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... That pisses me off. This isn't exactly what you call a cooperative relationship."  
  
__Sion__: "...... You are right. I understand how you feel. But that is why I decided not to tell you."  
  
__Shiki__: "You deliberately hid this?"  
  
__Sion__: "Yes. I thought you might refuse to cooperate if you knew, and I didn't want to lose a valuable partner. I decided it was best to conceal it."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... I see. You just certainly know everything about what I would do."  
  
__Sion__: "Of course. But it is a last resort. If I did use it, there would be no going back."  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "───────────"  
  
__Sion__: "I understand if you want to part ways here. You are free to return if you wish."  
  
__Shiki__: "───────────"  
  
__Sion__: "............ Shiki. If you have something to say, just say it────"  
  
__Shiki__: "───────────"  
  
__Sion__: "────────"  
  
__Shiki__: "────Sion. You knew I would be angry, but that's because you knew it was something wrong."  
  
__Sion__: "Not at all. It is the best course of action, so I do not think it is wrong."  
  
__Shiki__: "(STARE────────)"  
  
__Sion__: "────────"  
  
__Shiki__: "(STARE────────)"  
  
__Sion__: "───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────"  
  
__Shiki__: "(...... *sigh* It's not that she's good at lying, she simply cannot tell them.)"  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "That's okay. Let's just drop it."  
  
__Sion__: "Eh?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Let's just forget about what happened earlier. ...... Well, it was a pretty good plan after all."  
  
__Sion__: "Huh?"  
  
__Shiki__: "I'm saying, you were right, it might really have been the best course of action after all. With your bluff, you were able to drive Senpai away."  
  
__Sion__: "────────"  
  
__Sion__: "...... Wrong, it was not a threat. I was not lying earlier, I really was───kyaa!?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Stupid, at times like this, you should just go with it. You should just say 'yes' like you normally do, Sion."  
  
__Sion__: "Y...... yes, if you say so, Shiki───"  
  
__Shiki__: "Alright, then that's how we'll look at it. But I have a few things to ask you, and I don't want you leaving out the details."  
  
__Sion__: "......................................................................................."  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Alright. Senpai said you were a wanted criminal. What's that about? Aren't you just researching a cure for vampirism?"  
  
__Sion__: "As you say, I am just researching a cure for vampirism. But, that went against the doctrine of Atlas."  
  
__Sion__: "The Magi Association I belong to makes no exceptions for breaking its precepts. In my research, I had to do just that. That is why they are after me."  
  
__Shiki__: "Breaking its precepts... Sion, did you kill someone in your experiments?"  
  
__Sion__: "Of course not. The Atlas Academy only has one precept. The results of one's research are not to be shared with anyone other than the researcher. ...... But I could not complete my research with just Atlas's resources alone. I needed the help of other associations. I traveled to them, and traded my research for theirs. To Atlas, that is an unforgivable sin. I knew they were chasing me, but it is surprising they even went so far as to reach an agreement with The Church. Then again, I have been out of touch for half a year."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... Hm. What you're saying is, your school doesn't permit you to study abroad?"  
  
__Sion__: "...... Yes. You could put it that way. By doing so, I have been branded a traitor."  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "A traitor, isn't that a little...... much? Senpai was pretty serious, I couldn't imagine why. ...... But your explanation about breaking the rules makes sense. Still, why did you have to go so far if you knew what kind of trouble you'd get into?"  
  
__Sion__: "...... There was no other way. If I stayed in Atlas, I couldn't finish my research on vampires. Staying would have been a mistake. I must find a cure for vampirism, by any means necessary───!"  
  
__Shiki__: "Well, then, I guess it can't be helped. (Sion's really not the type to back down.)"  
  
__Shiki__: "Alright. Well, let's get started finding Arcueid then."  
  
__Sion__: "Eh?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Well, Sion, you said you need Arcueid's help to complete your research, right? So we have to hurry up and talk to her. I promised you that I'd see this through to the end."  
  
__Sion__: "...... You mean, maybe I cannot say it directly...... that you still plan on helping me?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah."  
  
__Sion__: "But I used you as a shield. And if I decide it is the best course of action again, there's no way you can stop me from doing it! Even knowing that────um."  
  
__Shiki__: "It's alright. It would be tough for me to find the rumored vampire without you, Sion."  
  
__Sion__: "───────────────────────────────────────────"  
  
__Sion__: "Yes. I understand, Shiki."  
  
__Shiki__: "Well, our partnership is renewed...... Ah, that's right."  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Partners usually shake hands to mark the occasion, but we kind of skipped that part."  
  
__Shiki__: "Here."  
  
__Sion__: "?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah, a handshake. Maybe we should do that, Sion."  
  
__Sion__: "............ (open, close)"  
  
__Shiki__: "? Sion, you're just opening and closing your hand. Maybe... you think my hand is dirty or something?"  
  
__Sion__: "............... (Open, close. Open, close.)"  
  
__Shiki__: "???"  
  
__Sion__: "(Stops)────Shiki."  
  
__Shiki__: "Uh, eh? Wha, what is it? D−did I do something wrong!?"  
  
__Sion__: "...... There's no need for you to touch me excessively. I may be on the run from Atlas, but I am still the successor of the House of Eltnam. In the future, please bear that in mind."  
  
__Shiki__: "Ah───yeah, got it."  
  
__Sion__: "The operation will commence at once. In the daytime I can gather information on my own, but at night, we are better off patrolling the town together. I will not be able to do anything if I find the True Ancestor alone, and it would be dangerous for you if you encountered the rumored vampire alone."  
  
__Shiki__: "Eh────slow down there, Sion! I need to rest a little from that fight!"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "...... Ah, still no results."  
  
I returned to my bed.   
  
Three hours since Shiki and I patrolled the town.   
  
But we didn't get any results, and we promised to meet up again before we left.  
  
Shiki's mission during the day is to find and speak to the True Ancestor.   
  
In his stead, I have to go around town and gather information.

## Cry Out, You Flies  
  
### Alice's Insanity  
  
----  
  
────A dream.  
  
I'm working with Shiki to find the vampire.   
  
The same goals, different goals.   
  
Shiki's circle, my circle.   
  
The centers are far from each other, but there are places where they overlap; our vague, mixed promise.  
  
────That I am watching.  
  
He said we were partners.   
  
Partner. Cohort. Someone the same age as I, someone whose goals are similar to my own. Does that make us friends?  
  
----  
  
The two of us are hunting the vampire together.   
  
Shiki is working with me.   
  
I also wish to help him.  
  
Until now, I never dreamed of these kinds of things.  
  
----  
  
────That's why this is a dream.  
  
All this is transient.   
  
The product of my sleeping imagination.   
  
When I awake, Shiki and I will be back to being strangers.  
  
I wait for that time.   
  
That is my goal now, my final destination.   
  
But if...   
  
But if the dream continues until then, maybe it would be something good───?  
  
----  
  
The name Eltnam. Something of a scar on the face of Atlas.  
  
Awe. Loathing. Avoidance. Criminal.   
  
No one said that, but that's how I was viewed.   
  
A family known for their long devotion to alchemy.   
  
Once considered distinguished nobility, respected figures who commanded great influence.   
  
When did that all change?  
  
----  
  
...... But by the time I was born, the House of Eltnam was ruined; our distinguished family name was ignored.  
  
The primary cause of this was that three generations ago, the House of Eltnam broke the rule of Atlas.  
  
The secondary cause was that the other alchemists feared our methods.  
  
----  
  
I think there were many reasons.   
  
I simply continued to be the perfect student, to defend the pride of Eltnam.   
  
I didn't care how others viewed me.   
  
I took pride in my pride.   
  
I endeavored to become the best possible alchemist.   
  
I became a leader of the other students, I treated others fairly, I took on additional responsibilities, I excelled in all the literary and military arts taught at Atlas.  
  
...... I hid my dark feelings deep inside, while I played the bright honor student.  
  
----  
  
The people around me could never tell.   
  
They treated me as the perfect student I wanted them to see.   
  
I caught the eye of the Academy president, and achieved the ultimate honor of being named the next Director.   
  
In the future of Sion Eltnam, there was no darkness.   
  
If I avoided trouble, and things went well for me, the stain on the house of Eltnam might well be erased with my generation.  
  
----  
  
────Despite that,   
  
         I strayed from my path.  
  
----  
  
Even though there were no problems.   
  
They couldn't resist me, only ignore me.   
  
As a successor of Eltnam, there was no doubting my abilities.   
  
My future was not a problem.   
  
No reason at all.   
  
None that I could see.  
  
----  
  
But still, I was trapped by my own doubts.   
  
With most questions, I could calculate some kind of solution, but I couldn't solve the problem of myself.   
  
Moment by moment, the subtle gap between myself and others was increasing.   
  
Unnoticed, my burden had grown heavier────  
  
────My disguise as the perfect student peeled away.  
  
----  
  
#### *Misaya at day*  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "...... Hot......"  
  
I awoke to sunshine hot enough to burn my skin.   
  
...... A little past noon.   
  
My body still needs sleep, and I haven't even fully recovered yet.  
  
__Sion__: "Not good...... My mission during the day is to collect data."  
  
----  
  
I have to keep my promise.   
  
For the sake of my partner who just nodded like it was nothing after I did all that to him.  
  
__Sion__: "...... This heat certainly is harsh......"  
  
I touch my palm absently.   
  
...... It is regretful, but I cannot reproduce the sensation of Shiki's hand.  
  
All the same───the feeling from last night has not faded.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Shiki's hand was so big compared to mine. I knew men's and women's body types were different, but I didn't realize just how different."  
  
And having a conversation with someone my own age for the first time, like it was nothing.   
  
Ever since I came to this country, it's been nothing but the unexpected.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "──A promise, huh. I no longer need to gather information on Tatari, but since Shiki said he needed some, I have to gather some."  
  
I pull my heavy body up and get back to work.   
  
I only need to do one thing.   
  
Go into town and research the rumors of the people.  
  
__Sion__: "It would be nice if this ends up helping Shiki."  
  
Well, I know he will be grateful no matter what the outcome is.  
  
Tohno Shiki is an amazingly friendly person.   
  
His reactions are so fresh, they make me want to see him happy.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Tch!"  
  
I feel nauseous.   
  
Everything turns red and I may collapse if this keeps up.  
  
__Sion__: "───Not good. Right now, I have to gather information."  
  
In my current state, I can't even use Thought Partitioning.   
  
But I must complete my mission.  
  
----  
  
No signs of life on the road.   
  
I walk toward the town with the sun's rays beating down around me.  
  
__Sion__: "────────"  
  
My body is in pain, but not my mind.   
  
As much as I can, I have to gather information from this ghost town───  
  
----  
  
#### *Shrine*  
  
----  
  
It is ten minutes before our promised meeting time.   
  
Like yesterday, Sion arrives punctually.  
  
__Sion__: "Good evening, Shiki."  
  
__Shiki__: "Hey. I knew you'd be on time, Sion."  
  
__Sion__: "Yes. We did agree on the meeting time, after all, so I would not be late."  
  
...... Sion doesn't look so good.   
  
She didn't look too good yesterday, either, but her energy seems to be fading day by day.  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Sion, are you okay? You look like you're overdoing it."  
  
__Sion__: "There is no need to worry. Management of one's own body is a basic skill for alchemists. More importantly, have you found anything out about the True Ancestor, Shiki?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Ah, about that. I couldn't catch her today, either. I think she may be deliberately avoiding me."  
  
__Sion__: "───Hm, I expected as much."  
  
__Shiki__: "Huh? What do you mean by that, Sion?"  
  
__Sion__: "I cannot say for sure, but the True Ancestor will not appear before you until these rumors about a vampire cease. ...... Perhaps it is better this way. What are you going to do, Shiki?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Ah, I tried to contact her. If she went back to her room at least once, she should be in the park."  
  
__Sion__: "...... The park? That is where she has been witnessed the most, right?"  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "? Witnessed by who?"  
  
__Sion__: "The people of this town. I tried gathering information on the rumored vampire today, but what was on people's minds was actually the True Ancestor. They say that the one responsible for the Vampire Murders last year was a woman with golden hair. They say that the serial killer actually is a vampire. They say the one who has been attacking people recently lurks in the park."  
  
__Shiki__: "Wha...... what is that? If Arcueid is the source of these rumors, then they can't be believed, right?"  
  
__Sion__: "Of course. They are just rumors after all. But, if rumors converge, then they become real. The True Ancestor seems to walking around town aimlessly. That is why the rumors about her are increasing...... There are also rumors about a girl with red hair searching for her prey."  
  
__Shiki__: "G−girl with red hair!?"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "...... That is just what was said. At any rate, the rumors indicate that the True Ancestor is the serial killer. Please act accordingly, Shiki."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... Got it. Anyway, let's go to the park for now, Sion. We can probably meet up with Arcueid."  
  
__Sion__: "............ That is true. It might be better to have a painful experience at least once."  
  
__Shiki__: "Hm? Did you say something?"  
  
__Sion__: "Yes, but I was merely thinking aloud. Let's go to the park, Shiki."  
  
----  
  
#### *Park*  
  
----  
  
The moment we reach the park, I feel something wrong.   
  
The smell of blood is overpowering.  
  
We run into the depths of the park, fighting our way through the thick night air, to find────  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Wh..."  
  
__Sion__: "────────"  
  
__Arcueid__: "────"  
  
----  
  
Under the pale moon.   
  
Above the countless corpses, above the ground dyed with blood, Arcueid stands before us.  
  
__Arcueid__: "...... Hm. Despite being a failure, this could almost pass as the real thing."  
  
Glancing at the moon overhead, Arcueid laughs amusedly.  
  
----  
  
There's something strange in the air.   
  
Without a doubt that is Arcueid.   
  
But there's something slightly different, something not quite right with her.  
  
----  
  
__Arcueid__: "At last you're here. Shiki, you call someone and you don't even meet them on time. Not to mention when you finally arrive you're with some other woman. Now I'm starting to get ticked off."  
  
She giggles.   
  
The pressure builds in the air around us, the abnormality almost overwhelming.  
  
I start to lose my self−control, just like Akiha does when she is drunk.  
  
__Shiki__: "A−Arcueid, this is────"  
  
----  
  
__Arcueid__: "What, this? Because you were so late, I wanted to have a little fun. So I trapped five or six people here and played around with them. But, you don't need to worry. I didn't drink their blood. I won't do anything that makes me lose control like drinking blood."  
  
__Shiki__: "────You..."  
  
__Arcueid__: "What, you're upset? Then I'm sorry, but I did hold back, you know? But humans are so frail, and they just died after I petted them. Rather than being enjoyable, it stressed me out even more."  
  
__Shiki__: "────"  
  
__Sion__: "...... No, Shiki. That is not the True Ancestor."  
  
----  
  
__Arcueid(?)__: "...... Oh? It's you of all people, Sion."  
  
__Shiki__: "Eh───You two know each other!?"  
  
__Sion__: "..........................."  
  
Arcueid(?): "Hm? No, we just met. But this is the second time we've ran into each other, right, Sion Eltnam Atlasia?"  
  
__Sion__: "Shiki. This is the vampire that has been stalking the town. Looking at her, in this situation, there is no other explanation."  
  
__Shiki__: "What...... No, that's wrong. That, has to be wrong. Because Arcueid would never────"  
  
__Sion__: "This is not Arcueid Brunestud. Is that not right, Arcueid Brunestud?"  
  
----  
  
__Arcueid(?)__: "Yeah, I'm really not Arcueid. I'm just an Arcueid, Shiki. ...... Ah, is this confusing you? Would it be easier to understand if I said I was a fake Arcueid?"  
  
__Shiki__: "A fake...... I can understand that, but you─"  
  
__Sion__: "A fake is not exactly correct. Because it really is Arcueid Brunestud. In the first place, that Dead Apostle...... 'Tatari' cannot be described of in terms of real and fake. It is just the manifestation of rumors about a sinister vampire───"  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "Hmph, after three years it's still the same old thing. But, I don't mind that about you. After all, you were probably antagonized by what happened. But I'm happy you're chasing after me though. Yes, it really was a good idea to let you live."  
  
__Sion__: "If your intent is self−destruction, then you are correct. I came here to stop you, Tatari. I may not be able to make you disappear totally, but I can at least stand in your way───!"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Ah...... agghh......!"  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "Dummy. You think you can maintain your sanity with me as you did before?"  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "Then, I'll make it easier on you. It really would have been okay to make you my next, but you do not compare to the body of this True Ancestor. ...... You really do have the worst timing."  
  
__Sion__: "Ah...... Shi... ki......"  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "───! ...... What are you doing, Shiki? Are you getting in my way?"  
  
__Shiki__: "...... Hey now. That's not it, you idiot."  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "?"  
  
__Sion__: "?"  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "I'm not getting in your way. For saying something like that while looking like Arcueid, I'll just dismantle you."  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "───Oh? For a human, you're pretty bloodthirsty...... I wonder if I should allow you to keep boasting so much."  
  
__Shiki__: "────────"  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "Fine, I'll play with you. Since it's you, Shiki, it should be a lot of fun!"  
  
----  
  
## *Shiki vs Arcueid(Tatari)*  
  
## *Shiki wins*  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Did we do it────!?"  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────"  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "Oh man. For you to beat me, not fully formed as I am... what a false start. Shiki, you really are unbelievable."  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "But, it's all pointless, Shiki. Killing me is meaningless. And you know, you shouldn't really show off your toy like that so early. I can kill a nobody like you in a flash if you let me in on your secret."  
  
__Shiki__: "You don't have to say it. I'm well aware of that already."  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "Oh really? That's good. I'll see you two later. I'll kill you right away next time."  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Gone...... no, more importantly, Sion......!"  
  
__Shiki__: "Sion, are you okay!?"  
  
__Sion__: "Don't touch me......!"  
  
__Shiki__: "Um, but......"  
  
__Sion__: "I said, don't touch me."  
  
__Shiki__: "........................"  
  
__Sion__: "There is no need to worry, as that thing is gone now."  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "...... If you say so. Aren't you hurt?"  
  
__Sion__: "That is nothing you need to think about. You should put your priority on the vampire, correct?"  
  
__Shiki__: "...... Maybe you're right. Then I have a question. Who was that Arcueid just now? You both used the term 'fake', but it really was Arcueid. It used Arcueid's face and killed five people...... Huh? Huh!?"  
  
__Sion__: "No bodies, right? It really was nothing more than scattered trash. ...... But from far away, it could look like dead bodies."  
  
__Shiki__: "Wh−why!? I know there were dead bodies, and there was even the smell of blood......!?"  
  
__Sion__: "A hallucination. Were you not influenced by the rumor that a killer is in the park? That was the True Ancestor from before──no, the Dead Apostle Tatari, to be more precise."  
  
__Shiki__: "Eh? That Arcueid was Tatari?"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "...... Yes. The Dead Apostle who can make rumors into reality. The vampire clad in the shape of rumors. There are strange rumors spreading through this town. False information that feels real is passed between people. The moment a rumor becomes widespread, Tatari appears. No, you can say it occurs. Tatari cannot exist independently. It is like a mirage rising from people's fermented uneasiness."  
  
__Shiki__: "......? Sorry, but I'm a bit at sea right now."  
  
__Sion__: "A little... in the ocean? I do not know what you mean, but let's disregard that."  
  
__Sion__: "Simply put, the Dead Apostle Tatari does not have a form of its own, only taking form when rumors 'become so real that no one doubts them'. People of this town began to believe that the killer is a woman with blonde hair. And since you knew Arcueid Brunestud, you denied the rumor, yet feared it was true. The convergence of rumors and what you knew. As they mixed, Tatari became Arcueid Brunestud. ...... The Tatari before was a fake True Ancestor, yet was the True Ancestor at the same time. At least for you, it was reality. Were you not thinking how bad it would be if the True Ancestor drank blood like a vampire? You were not thinking that the vampire in this town was a fake True Ancestor. Tatari thus became what you feared, 'The True Ancestor who became just like a vampire'."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... What do you mean? That just because I was anxious, that appeared?"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "The meaning of Tatari is a curse. People destroy themselves with a blind belief of the curse they themselves created. Tatari is a Dead Apostle who continues existing by becoming the uneasiness of others. As Tatari is the embodiment of their 'uneasiness', they cannot resist and can only have their blood sucked. ...... It appears Tatari is not yet fully formed. Your anxiety was not sufficient enough for it to be a widespread rumor."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... I kind of understand now. So you mean Tatari has the same powers as whatever people imagine it to have? Then what happens if people think about something other than Arcueid?"  
  
__Sion__: "He would of course become that instead. ...... Tatari does not have a true form of its own, so it will take that form before it appears. In the past, Tatari once became a divine beast as large as a mountain. But, that is only because many more people feared the darkness back then. In the current age, Tatari will not become anything that strong. However, if Tatari is able to become the True Ancestor, then it will certainly reach that level."  
  
__Shiki__: "R−really!? Well, certainly an unrestrained Arcueid would be invincible...... Uwaa, what would happen then!?"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Simple. If Tatari occurs fully, it will destroy everything around it. No matter what exact shape Tatari takes, it will be the realization of people's fears. Those that fear something cannot resist it."  
  
__Shiki__: "Man...... I understand that, but why was Tatari able to use just my uneasiness? If people simply do not have to be uneasy, then all I have to do is not think that Arcueid is the vampire, right?"  
  
__Sion__: "No, that would only affect you internally. Tatari's goal is to become the worst possible thing to be imagined in the area. So it is very likely that it will use you."  
  
__Shiki__: "That's what I'm saying. Why me?"  
  
__Sion__: "Y−you are the one most connected with the True Ancestor. Because you stand in the True Ancestor's favor, this town is highly regarded."  
  
__Shiki__: "The True Ancestor's favor...... isn't that a strange way of putting it?"  
  
__Sion__: "Perhaps. I did try to choose the right words."  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "────"  
  
__Sion__: "────"  
  
__Shiki__: "────────"  
  
__Sion__: "────────"  
  
__Shiki__: "────────────"  
  
__Sion__: "────────────"  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "A−anyway! Think what you want, but why does that make me highly regarded by Tatari?"  
  
__Sion__: "Because you know the True Ancestor very well. What's more, you really do know a lot about vampires. Even if it cannot take advantage of your uneasiness about the True Ancestor, you still have uneasiness about vampires."  
  
__Shiki__: "Uneasiness about vampires───like Nrvnqsr still being alive or maybe a fight between Ciel−senpai and Akiha, or......?"  
  
__Sion__: "Yes. Those possibilities are also high. Curses work more on the principle of changing things which exist rather than creating something out of nothing. Please think of Tatari as a sort of Dead Apostle who uses 'curses' as familiars. In this situation, wouldn't it simply be easier for Tatari to take possession of the True Ancestor and start rampaging rather than truly becoming a rampaging True Ancestor? Furthermore, the strength of your uneasiness is much stronger than anyone else's. As you have seen vampires many times before, a regular person's imagination pales in comparison."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... Then, even though we defeated Tatari, it could just reappear as Ciel−senpai or Akiha?"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "That possibility exists. ...... The worst case would be Tatari becoming the True Ancestor, but the rumors are still growing. There is still time for Tatari to appear as a Dead Apostle. The Tatari from before was simply an experiment using the rumors here. So if you think not of the True Ancestor but of a vampire who was once human, Tatari might shift to that."  
  
__Shiki__: "That's pretty inconvenient...... In other words, it falls on me to decide..."  
  
__Sion__: "Because Tatari uses your imagination. But what decides is really this town. There are many people afraid of what is happening."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... I see. You really know a lot about this. It's almost as if you specialized in this."  
  
__Sion__: "Yes, because this makes it the second time I have seen Tatari."  
  
__Shiki__: "Oh, I see. That's why you know so...... wait."  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Second time!? Sion, you fought that!?"  
  
__Sion__: "Yes, three years ago. The time and place of Tatari's occurrence was random, there was an attempt to conceal it. I answered The Church's request to suppress Tatari and fought against it."  
  
__Shiki__: "The Church's request...... but if Tatari is here, then that means it failed?"  
  
__Sion__: "Yes. Both the attempts to suppress it and even our attempts to defend against it...... The Church did not understand what Tatari was. Even though I warned them it was not something that could be destroyed, they only carried their normal Conceptual Weapons. Just like you did just now, they defeated Tatari many times. But it was meaningless. Tatari is like a natural phenomenon. No matter how many times it is defeated, it can occur again once certain conditions are met."  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "A natural phenomenon occurring once certain conditions are met...... you mean like rain or snow?"  
  
__Sion__: "Yes. Even if storm clouds were dispersed to prevent a windstorm, they would no doubt occur again. But this typhoon does not occur that often. The conditions are rather complicated."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... A Dead Apostle that will continue occurring as long as the world occurs? ...... That's just like..."  
  
__Shiki__: "(Just like Roa...... existing through others.)"  
  
__Sion__: "Yes, what is it, Shiki?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Ah, nothing. So what exactly are these conditions?"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Generally speaking, there are four of them. One, there needs to be a rumor about an individual, preferably an extension of something human. ...... This is not necessarily a minimum rule. It is what Tatari desires. Tatari was originally human, so it cannot move without human intelligence."  
  
__Sion__: "Two, the extent of this legend must be somewhat socially isolated. It is hard to spread a rumor uniformly across a large area. That is why Tatari normally occurs in isolated villages. ...... It helps to have something which occurred earlier to base it on, like in this town."  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Three, there must be one, or several, witnesses in the place where the rumor is spreading. There are varied ways of being a witness, such as knowing the basis of the rumor like you or those people in town who spread it. The rumor must have a terminal point. Usually, it begins with one person and floods forth from there. In some rare instances, there are those who guide the rumors intentionally to form Tatari according to their own thoughts. Probably they are on the same wavelength as Tatari. Those people do not have any ill intentions, but wonder themselves why things turn out the way they thought."  
  
__Sion__: "Four, the place where the rumors begin must be determined beforehand by Tatari. And the realization of people's anxiety can only be hatched for one evening. That is the limit of that conception. Tatari is a Reality Marble. It is impossible for it to occur for longer than one evening."  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Everything was explained to the Knights of The Church three years ago, but they did not listen. ...... From the very beginning, they only believed one thing, and that was not to consider the explanation worth believing."  
  
__Sion__: "The result was the death of all the villagers and the annihilation of the Knights. Riesbyfe...... the leader let me escape, but she did not survive herself. And I was not able to escape either. I was only able to survive because Tatari took pity on me."  
  
__Shiki__: "You survived because it took pity on you......?"  
  
__Shiki__: "(...... Then, you mean───you had your blood sucked, Sion?───)"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Ah......"  
  
__Sion__: "....................."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... I see. Then what happened earlier makes sense. The outer form may have been Arcueid, but inside it was truly the Dead Apostle named Tatari. That's why you were unable to resist it."  
  
__Sion__: "..............."  
  
__Shiki__: "And that is why you are researching a way to cure vampirism. ...... Certainly, you have to continue your research at all costs. Even if you are treated like a traitor, you have to do it."  
  
__Sion__: "───You are correct. I was... bitten by Tatari."  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Three years ago. In the forest, Tatari caught me. ...... Tatari is a Dead Apostle limited to only one generation; an abnormality that won't reproduce itself. Yet, it still let me live. Even though Tatari is completely a vampire, it is not a perfect Dead Apostle. Tatari drinks the blood of others, but even if it gives blood to others, it is unable to make others its complete subordinates. The poison of its blood as a vampire is weak. That is why I am able to remain human. But this time, if it completely takes form, Tatari's influence will grow tremendously. Since Tatari never occurred in these past three years, I was able to remain as myself. But if Tatari occurs, I may become a full vampire."  
  
__Shiki__: "────────"  
  
__Sion__: "The body of a vampire is superior to that of a human's. The only saving grace is that as an alchemist, I will be able to fight better. But a superior body requires more fuel...... But you can say this fuel is bad. Vampires are unable to use regular food. For vampires, the highest concentration of energy is found in the blood of their own race. Desiring blood is no more than a life function for vampires...... No matter what, you cannot resist it just using reason alone."  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Tatari may be fully formed at any day now. Since it is this burdensome to fight Tatari before it even has occurred, I cannot say for sure how things will turn out when I face it again."  
  
__Sion__: "If Tatari has limited intelligence, it will not be a problem. But if it has intelligence like before, it is very likely that I will become a vampire. Tatari will not ignore me as my parent vampire."  
  
__Shiki__: "Humans who have had their blood sucked by a Dead Apostle cannot go against their parent...... That is why you are still alive?"  
  
__Sion__: "Tatari can only occur for one night. So, Shiki. Please consider what will happen when I face Tatari."  
  
__Shiki__: "────You mean, kill you if you become a vampire?"  
  
__Sion__: "If you cannot do it, then it is best if we part here."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... And? No matter what, you'll still pursue Tatari?"  
  
__Sion__: "Of course. Tatari will occur before I can find a cure to vampirism. If I wish to avoid becoming a vampire, I have to dispel Tatari before I become its subordinate."  
  
__Shiki__: "Even though you can't oppose Tatari?"  
  
__Sion__: "It is not that I cannot oppose Tatari. I simply need strong willpower when I fight. So, Shiki, what will you choose? I recommend that we part here."  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Why?"  
  
__Sion__: "You cooperated with me to gain information, not to help me fight Tatari. And you do not even know when I will become your enemy. If you wish to fight Tatari, it is safer to do so on your own."  
  
__Shiki__: "That makes sense. But, you don't have anything more to tell me, right?"  
  
__Sion__: "...... Unfortunately, I have nothing more to tell you. So, it is best if we part here."  
  
__Shiki__: "............ I get it. Then we'll do that."  
  
__Sion__: "───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────"

## If You Call That Name At Night  
  
### Around and Alone  
  
----  
  
────And,   
  
When I came to, it was already evening.  
  
__Sion__: "...... I can't believe it. I don't even remember what I did all day."  
  
No, I remember.   
  
I parted with Shiki last night.   
  
Not to see each other again later, but a true cutting of our ties.  
  
----  
  
After that, my memories are vague.   
  
I pulled my exhausted body here, and then────slept until now.  
  
__Sion__: "............ It's so..."  
  
Heavy.   
  
I knew from the beginning it was just a dream.   
  
But I didn't want to wake up to reality.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "That is absurd. It is all within my calculations."  
  
Shiki discovered my connection to Tatari.   
  
This is the only natural result.   
  
Knowing all that, I still teamed up with him.  
  
----  
  
───Unfortunately,   
  
I have nothing more to tell you───  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "What───was so unfortunate? Regretting something means the solution was incorrect. That is impossible. My predictions are not wrong."  
  
...... More importantly,   
  
I have to go.   
  
Tatari will definitely appear tomorrow.   
  
I have to negate the rumors and fix Tatari's form───  
  
----  
  
#### *Shrine*  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Ah......"  
  
Why did I come here?   
  
I have no reason to anymore.  
  
__Sion__: "...... This isn't good...... I wasn't paying attention and I came here instinctually."  
  
But why this instinct?   
  
What was I seeking?   
  
Who was I seeking?   
  
I stop that line of thought.  
  
The plan is simple.   
  
I have to do this alone────  
  
----  
  
#### *Misaya at night*  
  
----  
  
I walk alone through town.   
  
...... Am I completely exhausted?   
  
I was always alone before, but I never felt lonely like this.  
  
As usual, no one is in town.   
  
Just this sultry, oppressive night.   
  
It seems the only signs of life in this silent town are the lighted convenience stores.  
  
__Shiki__: "Down the hatch. It's hot out, so juice is always good."  
  
__Sion__: "────"  
  
----  
  
It is a little annoying.   
  
But, it really is delicious.  
  
I may be hallucinating, but it feels like my thirst has been quenched for the first time in years.  
  
The police box is empty.   
  
The policeman may be on patrol, but I have yet to pass one yet.   
  
So what is this police box for?  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "A gun is going overboard. Well, Senpai is also a little overboard, but...... eh, me? I don't think I'm a problem, but...... if a policeman sees us we might both get arrested. This person right here does stand out a bit, so if we are seen we should just run away."  
  
__Sion__: "────────"  
  
What, does he mean my clothes?   
  
...... I start to get a little irritated.  
  
----  
  
These clothes are the only thing I allow myself to have a preference about.   
  
What is wrong with wearing these?  
  
He is rude.   
  
I should warn others about him, yes.  
  
----  
  
There are no lights on in the hotel.   
  
There are probably no customers, and it is as quiet as an abandoned ruin.  
  
__Shiki__: "I'm pretty tired, but if I went back, I wouldn't be able to sleep. ...... You know, it is normal to sleep in your room at night, and strange not to wake during the day. I have a lot of people around who are strangely quite sharp. It is really hard to fool them."  
  
__Sion__: "────────"  
  
----  
  
That effort is useless.   
  
Even I can see through his strange behavior.   
  
There is no way his family cannot.  
  
...... But, playing dumb may be one of his virtues.  
  
----  
  
I draw away from the main street.   
  
This back alley may be 'stagnant' like the park.   
  
When I explained that, he────  
  
__Sion__: "────This is pointless. What am I doing?"  
  
----  
  
Enough already.   
  
Enough already.   
  
Enough already.   
  
Enough already.  
  
----  
  
Admit it.   
  
Admit feeling disappointed.   
  
Admit that you wanted to be friends with him as long as possible.  
  
───So, Just admit it and come out.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Ah────"  
  
I feel like I'm going to collapse.   
  
My throat is so parched.   
  
As soon as I admitted to 'wanting' the friend I parted with, I started to feel nauseous.  
  
My neck hurts.   
  
My punctured nerves start to pulse, as if trying to burst forth from that wound that I know healed long ago.  
  
My throat is so dry.   
  
As if my heart rose to my throat, it pounds faster, quicker, demandingly.  
  
__Sion__: "Ha────aaahhh────!"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Haaa...... aaah... aaahh, AAAH────"  
  
I came here guided by my nausea and pain.   
  
As I come here, they gradually lessen.   
  
And here,  
  
__Sion__: "────can't, understand..."  
  
__Nrvnqsr(Tatari)__: "No, everyone clings to what they desire. No one can abandon that."  
  
----  
  
Tatari was waiting for me.  
  
__Sion__: "...... How foolish. Shiki just defeated you yesterday and you still appear? If you can't wait until tomorrow, I will defeat you here."  
  
__Nrvnqsr(Tatari)__: "That is a matter of if I lose. Right now, I could dispose of you with one bite. I will obtain your brain for my purposes."  
  
__Sion__: "Don't underestimate me. Don't think you can beat me so easily────!"  
  
----  
  
## *Sion vs Nrvnqsr(Tatari)*  
  
## *Sion loses*  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Tchh......!"  
  
__Nrvnqsr(Tatari)__: "You fought well, Sion Eltnam. But, that is as far as you go. No matter how hard you work your mind, your body is at its limit, is it not?"  
  
__Sion__: "────Aah, Hahh────"  
  
__Nrvnqsr(Tatari)__: "Farewell. Your fruitless effort was much appreciated."  
  
----  
  
...... I'm, losing consciousness.  
  
This is the end.   
  
This is where I end.  
  
...... I should have no regrets.   
  
Because, I finally found the answer I was looking for after all my calculations────  
  
__Nrvnqsr(Tatari)__: "───You. Not once, but twice you dare to face me?"  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "That's my line. Not appearing just once, but twice? There's no place for you here."  
  
Ah, I'm watching another dream.   
  
This has to be a waking dream.  
  
...... I think,   
  
I think I am a little lucky.   
  
Because at the very end, I get to see the dream I longed for the most───  
  
----  
  
## *Shiki vs Nrvnqsr(Tatari)*  
  
## *Shiki wins*  
  
----  
  
────And so, he defeats the vampire.  
  
__Nrvnqsr(Tatari)__: "UFJK? 214uI[[[? KCFKD SGHSOPGJ%$'(&!??????"  
  
The death throes echo in the air.  
  
One of the lords of the Dead Apostles which once appeared in this town starts to fade.  
  
__Nrvnqsr(Tatari)__: "YUdfg,,AGAAAAX!!!!!!"  
  
----  
  
Tatari fades.  
  
I open my eyes to see it off, but my body does not respond well.  
  
__Shiki__: "────"  
  
He is saying something.  
  
And with that, I discern this is a dream.  
  
I seem to be in a more girlish situation than I thought possible.  
  
I seem to be desired by this dashing hero who saved me, the damsel in distress.  
  
----  
  
...... But, this is a dream.  
  
There's no reason for him to come help me.  
  
In fact, since he is patrolling town, there is an even less likelihood of him being here.   
  
More than anything else, he knows my true form.  
  
It would be a contradiction for him to help me, since he hates vampires so much.  
  
----  
  
That's why this is a dream.  
  
In the instant before death, a fantasy I watch because I am unable to look death in the face.  
  
----  
  
......... Yeah.  
  
But, it isn't bad.  
  
My lips become loose.  
  
Seeing such a great dream causes me to want to give myself a lot of credit────  
  
----  
  
  
## If the Sight Dawns  
  
### Goodbye  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "...... Morning?"  
  
When I wake up, I find myself in bed.  
  
There is nothing wrong with my body.  
  
Well, nothing more than usual. I do not appear to be at my limit like yesterday.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "...... I have gotten thirstier, but my wounds have healed......"  
  
...... My memories are muddled.  
  
How much of what happened last night was real?  
  
I fought Tatari which assumed the shape of Nrvnqsr Chaos, and lost.  
  
After that, I was brought here, half−dead.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Did we both defeat each other? Tatari beat me, but was unable to carry it to completion?"  
  
..........  
  
................  
  
......................  
  
__Sion__: "───I am a failure."  
  
----  
  
What wishful thinking.  
  
After being defeated, there was no way I could have escaped.  
  
__Sion__: "...... Then, maybe..."  
  
----  
  
As soon as I wish that, I feel nauseous.  
  
Is that not also wishful thinking?  
  
There's no chance of that. Never.  
  
__Sion__: "Never? But saying never like this..."  
  
It seems I have to admit I am not as strong as I thought.  
  
How many days have I been broken?  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "...... I know it already. Tatari simply let me go. Just like three years ago, I was pitied again."  
  
With that outpouring of emotion, my vision turns red.  
  
Probably from anger.  
  
Once again I was pitied by that vampire.  
  
Allowed to escape as if I was a friend.  
  
__Sion__: "───Unforgivable."  
  
----  
  
I will have my revenge on the one who dirtied the name of Eltnam.  
  
Tatari will emerge completely tonight.  
  
There is no time. I have to prepare myself to fight and cut away all useless thoughts.  
  
...... Like last night.  
  
Such lingering thoughts dulled my mind, and I have to discard all dreams.  
  
----  
  
#### *Shrine*  
  
----  
  
The tall, partially−constructed skyscraper.  
  
I knew from the beginning where Tatari would occur.  
  
I did not come here because I sensed the vampire here.  
  
I knew Tatari's rules and calculated that this would be the next site of occurrence.  
  
All I knew was that Tatari would be in the same place as the True Ancestor.  
  
This town, the one who cooperated with me, they were not important factors.  
  
__Sion__: "────Time to go. It is almost midnight."  
  
Forcing my mind to move past my pain and thirst, I advance forward.  
  
----  
  
And then,  
  
__Shiki__: "───Where are you going in that condition, Sion?"  
  
At the building's entrance, Shiki stands there, astonished.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "............... Shiki?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah. I thought if I waited here we'd meet up."  
  
__Sion__: "───But, why?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Hey now. You should know without me saying it."  
  
__Sion__: "────────"  
  
----  
  
I don't understand.  
  
It isn't his behavior that I don't understand, it is myself not able to think about anything before him that I don't understand.  
  
__Sion__: "Ah────"  
  
But, I have to think.  
  
It's strange for him to be here.  
  
It's strange for him to be in front of me.  
  
So, there has to be a reason.  
  
A logical, inevitable, verifiable reason.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "───That's, right. Forgive me, Shiki. I forgot something, right?"  
  
I reach out my fingers.  
  
I remove the Etherlite which was still attached to his head.  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "I removed the Etherlite. Now you are free."  
  
Yes, certainly the Etherlite was still attached.  
  
Even if it is Shiki, he didn't need to keep his life in my hands without saying anything.  
  
...... I did forget it until he pointed it out.  
  
__Shiki__: "..........................."  
  
__Sion__: "Shiki......? It is finished, so why are you still..."  
  
Standing there, just looking at me quietly?  
  
As if you were mad at what I just said.  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "*Sigh* It seems you won't understand unless I say it. ...... Well, that makes two of us."  
  
__Shiki__: "I waited for you yesterday, but I went out running through town since you didn't come. Unlike you, I don't know anything, so all I can do is run around."  
  
__Sion__: "...... I don't understand. Shiki, what are you trying to say?"  
  
__Shiki__: "What am I trying to say? You should know already. We made a promise to work for both of our goals, right?  
Both our goals have not been met. So───our joint front is not over."  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "...... I am disappointed. You seem not to have understood what I said earlier, Shiki. See, you wish to defend the town from Tatari, so being by me is dangerous. I am the same as one of his subordinates. I may be overwhelmed by the vampiric impulse and attack you any moment now. Trying to exterminate the vampire with such a thorn in your side is off the mark."  
  
__Shiki__: "Maybe it is a little dangerous. But without you around I can't pursue this Dead Apostle Tatari. And if you get controlled by Tatari, it'll be bad if no one is around to call out to you. Without someone cheering you on, won't you just lose to Tatari?"  
  
__Sion__: "─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "That is an overestimation. I do not have enough strength to resist Tatari. If someone is nearby, I still have no choice but to become his subordinate. So──"  
  
__Shiki__: "I don't think that's true. ...... And if that does happen, there's always running away. I'm pretty good at that."  
  
__Sion__: "────"  
  
----  
  
...... Ah, this is the worst.  
  
I cannot beat him in an argument.  
  
In the first place, explanations are just wasted on him.  
  
In theory, that can be a plus or a minus.  
  
However, his mind doesn't have anything to do with advantage or disadvantage, so you can't shoot down what he says.  
  
----  
  
...... Also,  
  
Having no power to resist, I am felled by his words.  
  
__Sion__: "...... I am a vampire. Do you still plan on accompanying me?"  
  
__Shiki__: "What's wrong with helping vampires who don't smell of blood? Besides, we're friends."  
  
__Sion__: "───Very well. If you go that far, then I will not refuse. Tatari will take shape at the top of this building soon. Are you really prepared?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah. Let's take him out together."  
  
After saying "together", Shiki starts walking.  
  
I stare blankly at his back.  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Sion? What's wrong? Don't we have to hurry?"  
  
Of course.  
  
...... But why do I suddenly think about that?  
  
...... What if, it was possible...  
  
If we could leave Tatari alone and just the two of us go off somewhere. What would────  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Agh...... ah"  
  
My throat hurts.  
  
This is the pain I brought upon myself.  
  
These past three years, I have only sought revenge against Tatari.  
  
This pain is warning me, Sion Eltnam, about how weak I've become.  
  
__Sion__: "─────────Yes. Let's hurry, Shiki."  
  
Hiding my neck with my hand, I follow after Shiki.  
  
----  
  
#### *Elevator*  
  
----  
  
...... The elevator rises.  
  
In the tight box, the two of us say nothing.  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "It seems like we've reached the top."  
  
__Sion__: "Shiki. Confirm once more. If I fall and come under Tatari's control, kill me before I kill anyone else. Because you accompanied me this far, you now have that duty."  
  
__Shiki__: "............ I'll do my best, so you should too, Sion."  
  
__Sion__: "Of course. I will fight Tatari with all my power."  
  
After we nod wordlessly, the elevator door opens.  
  
----  
  
#### *Rooftop of Shrine*   
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "───Already......! It has already formed this much......"  
  
![ball](https://i.imgur.com/wawGCgF.png)  
  
__Shiki__: "That is Tatari's true form...... Damn it, I can't see any lines."  
  
__Sion__: "...... Yes, as you say, you cannot see any lines of death there. Not even you can kill words. Inside there, it is still nothing but words. You cannot kill that which has yet to exist. All we can do is wait for Tatari to hatch."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... I see. But, there doesn't really seem to be any need for that, because he's already..."  
  
__Shiki__: "... become Arcueid."  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "I knew it───you would use the mind of the one who knows most about vampires in this town to draw out your curse, Tatari."  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "Of course, Sion. I was a Dead Apostle who wanted to become a True Ancestor after all. I failed and became this phenomenon, but this safeguard was really fortunate. I didn't believe there would be so many ups and downs though."  
  
__Sion__: "...... Perhaps you are right. Since the 15th Century, there was really no chance of the True Ancestor Royalty being conciliated with humans. ...... The only thing you did of worth was to believe in your ability to predict the future. ...... If it was me, I would not have believed this to be possible."  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "That is your limit, isn't it? Even if you have a superior mind, exercising only in theory leads to a lack of experience.  
Well...... maybe you have grown a little bit. Bringing Shiki along with you since you can't defeat me by yourself; the old you would never have even thought of it."  
  
__Sion__: "He is here as a witness, and will take my head if I cave in to you."  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "Oh really? I bet Shiki doesn't like that. Right Shiki?"  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "...... Yeah, you're right. But this is between you and Sion. If she tells me not to fight, I'll stay out of it unless she loses."  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "Ahaha, that's so like you, Shiki! Hm, maybe it'll be alright to play around a little. If I transferred my vampiric impulse to Sion, she'd fall way too quickly and that would be boring, right? Instead, I'll let you watch Sion suffer in pain, Shiki."  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "Of course, then you're next, Shiki. Since it's you, it'll be a great warm up before I drain everyone in this town of blood. I actually have a little confession to make. I always wondered what I should do to you for slicing a True Ancestor like me apart."  
  
__Shiki__: "───Shut up, vampire. Don't use her face and her voice to smile like that."  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "Oh, does it bother you? You'll be even more delicious than Sion."  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "Shiki, I know how you feel but you have to control yourself......! You will have your turn if I am defeated, right......!?"  
  
__Shiki__: "............ Tch."  
  
__Sion__: "This nonsense has gone on long enough, Tatari. I am the only one connected to you. I will take care of you without Shiki's help."  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "...... Heh. You think you can defeat me alone? You seem to be really trying hard, but let me show you a little of my power."

__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "Yes, I am Arcueid Brunestud, Princess of the True Ancestors. It is easy to shape my world as I see fit."  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "And there are no restrictions on me here. I wonder how much of a Demon Lord Brunestud can become when freed from her chains───Under this false moon, I will show you until you scream......!"

__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "That's surprising. You really do have some aptitude after all, Sion."  
  
__Sion__: "*gasp*, *pant*, ah────with this, I'll finally......!"  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "Yes, you win. I'll give you that. So I'll just disappear now. ───And then, you can fight hard again."  
  
__Sion__: "......? I, what......?"  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "Enough of this True AnceSTOR already. I HaVE to resume my reaCHINg for the Sixth unTIL the CRImson Moon comes OnCE agAIn."  
  
__Sion__: "......! Shiki, please kill me......!"  
  
__Shiki__: "Eh──stu, stupid, you think I can do that!?"  
  
__Sion__: "Just hurry! If you don't, I'll────"  
  
__Arcueid(Tatari)__: "Become Tatari. My ChiLD, GivE me that WeLL prePAred body of Eltnam......!"

__Shiki__: "...... What, did something happen......?"  
  
__Shiki__: "......! Sion, are you okay!?"  
  
__Sion__: "............... Shi, ki."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... Thank goodness you're safe, Sion."  
  
__Sion__: "............ Yes. But, I did become like this after all."  
  
__Shiki__: "? What are you say────!"  
  
__Shiki__: "......! Sion, what are────you saying? Your eyes are, red────"  
  
----  
  
__Sion__: "...... It is as you can see. With Tatari's destruction, I was also at my limit. Tatari's strategy was better than mine."  
  
__Sion__: "As Tatari was defeated, Tatari's vampiric impulse and even Tatari's will were transferred to me and now swirl inside my head.  
Further explanation is unnecessary. I am now completely a Dead Apostle. I have become Tatari's successor."  
  
__Shiki__: "............ No, you're wrong. That's not it at all. You're still yourself, right? So───you're not under his control."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "You say I am not Tatari. ...... Yes, that is correct, Shiki. Truthfully, Tatari's will did not transfer to me. What he wished for is beneath me. That is, yes."  
  
__Shiki__: "────────"  
  
----  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "He is already gone. Tatari will soon be no more."  
  
__Shiki__: "I see, that's good. ...... Then, won't you return to normal?"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "────No. I am different from before. I can no longer return to being human."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "...... With a vampire's body I was able to resist using my force of reason, but that reason has now lost. ...... Even this is painful. But, we did promise. At least I had to explain it to you."  
  
__Shiki__: "Wha, what are you saying? Tatari is no longer here, right? So there's nothing coercing you anymore. You can just act like you did before and────"  
  
----  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "───Yes, Tatari is gone. However, I can no longer resist a part of me that has nothing to do with Tatari at all."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "...... It would have been better if you were not here. Maybe I could have resisted."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "...... Shiki. Those who receive the blood of a Dead Apostle are not able to simply just live. As long as they have human emotions left, they attack people so as to drive those emotions away. ...... When that stops, they become full vampires. Most Dead Apostles just desire human blood for sport."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "But, I am still young. I cannot take pleasure in drinking blood like Tatari nor do I desire blood to become stronger. I just───want your blood, Shiki."  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "────Sion, you..."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "You promised, Shiki. You said you were ready. So───I want you to fulfill that promise. I can't approve of myself being a vampire. I hate being something that has to steal from others to live. I couldn't bear being like that."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "But more than that, I want your blood. If I can't have it, I should just shoot my brains out. But I can't kill myself. So────"  
  
__Shiki__: "────You want me to kill you?"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Yes. If not, you will be killed. I am finished. I will lose control if I taste blood. So before that happens────"  
  
__Shiki__: "...... That's ridiculous."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Come on──please do it, Shiki......!"  
  
__Shiki__: "...... That's ridiculous! Shit......! Why do I have to go through this again......!"

"........................"  
  
"────────"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "────Ack......! Ahh, ah, agh......!"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Ah, aghh───......! Ahh, ah...... I, I am, alive───?"  
  
__Shiki__: "........................"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "...... Why......? How come...... you didn't finish...... me off, Shiki......?"  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "I was just defeating you because you attacked me. Since you've calmed down, there's no reason to do any more."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "That's foolish......! A vampire's body is different from a human's! I will recover soon from these light wounds. You have to completely end the life of a vampire to make it powerless. You know that much already......!"  
  
__Shiki__: "────────"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Shiki, hurry and finish me......! Once I can move again, I will attack you. So before that happens, hurry──"  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "───Shut up! Stop saying such selfish things, you stupid idiot......!"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Eh, Shiki......?"  
  
__Shiki__: "So before that happens, hurry? What do you mean, hurry? Hurry and do what? You want me to kill you? You're saying it's better to kill you because you are a vampire? What is this?────you're telling me I have to kill another crying person......!!"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Ah────"  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "I refuse. Who could do that? I won't do it again. As long as you are you, I will never finish you off────!"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "───No, that's wrong, Shiki. I am not asking you to save me like that girl. Just, before I become a vampire I want you to────"  
  
__Shiki__: "That's the same thing! And don't speak so casually about Yumizuka. You and her are different. Yumizuka really could not live without human blood. But you are different, Sion. You haven't drank blood this whole time. And you haven't fully transformed, right? So what is this? Wasn't...... wasn't it your goal to cure those who became vampires, Sion......!!??"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "────────────────"  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "But now you're saying you just want blood!? Endure it! You've endured it until now, so why are you being a pushover!?"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Wha...... pushover? That is entirely baseless......! You don't even know what it feels like to have this burning impulse inside you......!"  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah!? Then I'll just stay with you until you calm down. ...... Look, if you drink blood your wounds will heal, right? Then bring it. I'll beat you down over and over until you calm down......!"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "......! You, you...... brought this on yourself......!"  
  
#### *Shiki and Vampire Sion fight*  
  
----  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Ah...... ahhh, ahh, hahh, what, what kind of monster are you────"  
  
__Shiki__: "Hah───you think you can get me swinging like that?───after only the fourth round your movements have gotten pretty sloppy."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Kk───that's, not true───I am, calmly, predicting, your moves───"  
  
__Shiki__: "Considering, you haven't, even, used, your, thread, or your, gun, Sion."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Th−that, is, a lie───I, definitely..."  
  
__Shiki__: "No, you haven't. I never thought, I would be in such a, kid−fight, at this age. ───But, that's a little dirty. Your swelling will soon, heal───No, you'll be fine, incompetent as you are. You're, finally, average as a, vampire."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Of, course. I was only, bitten, by the phenomenon, Tatari, an imperfect vampire. Once I, drink blood, I will be a, full vampire."  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Oh...... well? How about, round eight?"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "No. My body, won't move."  
  
__Shiki__: "What's this? You're better off than I am."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "But, it is mental. Your evading, of all my attacks, makes me so, tired."  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "───So. Have you calmed down, Sion?"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "...... Yes. I am able to do something about this desire to want you. But right now, I can't help but hate you."  
  
__Shiki__: "...... Hey. Isn't that replacing one problem with another?"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Yes. Until I slug you at least once, I can't calm down. You're the guy────who made me have this crazy temper tantrum."  
  
__Shiki__: "Sion. Your speech is... a little scary."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "That is also your fault. You always speak so crudely, so you transferred all this slang to me. Ah, you really───did transfer all this."  
  
__Shiki__: "Transfer? Transfer what?"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Ah, who knows. ───Anyway, let's rest. Neither you nor I can move very well."  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah, that sounds good───wait. Once you heal again, you can't attack me. If you still want to suck blood, we have to fight right now."  
  
----  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "───No, I give up. No matter what, I cannot attack you. ...... But, I still want to drink your blood and only yours. I will not attack anyone else. ...... Because you won against me."  
  
__Shiki__: "? I don't get it, but, whatever. Let's just get a little────"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Yes. Let us both, catch our breaths."  
  
----  
  
When I wake, the sun has already risen.  
  
The place where we first met becomes the place where we part.  
  
__Shiki__: "Are you really okay now, Sion?"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Yes. The vampiric impulse will not go away, but it is at a bearable level. It is simply like fasting."  
  
__Shiki__: "....................."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "You do not need to worry. Is not curing vampirism my goal? First I have to discover a way to drink blood without advancing the transformation into a vampire. Then, your relative could take in artificial blood and still maintain herself."  
  
__Shiki__: "Eh───my relative? You mean Akiha?"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Yes. I pulled her data from you. ...... I am interested in the vampires of Japan, but I will let it be. I am sure things would turn out like before if I did not."  
  
Yes, I want to avoid that.  
  
I don't ever want to do that childish, unskilled, wild fighting again.  
  
----  
  
...... Yes, never again would be good enough.  
  
As long as it remains unique, I will not be able to forget it easily.  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "───Well then, Shiki. If it is not said, it seems things will drag on."  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah. So, should I say it?"  
  
I shake my head "no".  
  
This is my story.  
  
So it falls upon me to lower the curtain.  
  
----  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Shiki. Now that Tatari is gone from this town, our work is over. I am grateful for all of your help."  
  
__Shiki__: "Same here. But in the end, all I did was just stay with you."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Is that so? Did you not find me before?"  
  
__Shiki__: "Hm...... I wonder. I thought you maybe forgot after being in shock."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "R−really? Then, let's just leave that aside."  
  
Remembering that dream, the vampiric impulse rises up in me.  
  
I look away and force it down.  
  
-----  
  
...... Because, this is the last time.  
  
The last time his memory will be with mine.  
  
If I cannot draw any more new data,  
  
if I make this memory the best,  
  
then we can be friends for the rest of our lives.  
  
----  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Today, the agent of The Church will probably come to catch me. Before then, I have to leave this country."  
  
__Shiki__: "Oh. Then, I guess this is goodbye."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Yes. Goodbye, Shiki."  
  
__Shiki__: "Yeah. Thanks for everything, Sion."  
  
----  
  
He really says that completely naturally.  
  
Words telling me that the dream is now over.  
  
But, those words were not cold or sad.  
  
Just, truly happy.  
  
----  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Shiki. As a friend, I want to leave you with some advice."  
  
__Shiki__: "Sure, go ahead."  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "Then, short and simple, okay? You should be a little more careful. The circumstances around you are always very rough. But your crisis awareness is too low. Consequently, those around you get very worried."  
  
__Shiki__: "───Hmm. Is that how it is?"  
  
__Vampire Sion__: "That is how it is. From now on, please consider your safety twice as much as you do now. That is all I have to say."  
  
───Saying that, I turn around.  
  
----  
  
__Shiki__: "Thanks for the warning. You take care too, Sion."  
  
I answer him with a "you too" and start walking.  
  
...... Because I can no longer keep up the pretense of being a perfect honor student.  
  
It seems after seeing me off, he also starts to walk away slowly.  
  
----  
  
The white morning.  
  
In the dazzling sunlight, we part ways.  
  
Nothing is left behind.  
  
Not my friendship, not my love, not my revenge.  
  
After pursuing Tatari so long, I must pursue something else.  
  
----  
  
In the end,  
  
there was only one thing we had in common.  
  
At the start of the sweltering new day,  
  
We both walk forward facing a new tomorrow───  
  
----
