**Nemo:**
We will soon enter the Antarctic Circle. TRISMEGISTUS II estimates that there won't be any danger for about a day. 

**Nemo:**
Which is to say that there is absolutely no interference from enemy forces expected until we reach Chaldea Base at the Antarctic. 

**Nemo:**
I expect all crew members to remain adequately focused and prepare for our arrival at the Antarctic. 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Finally&mdash;


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The time has come to return to Chaldea Base...


---

**Sion:**
Could I have a word before then? 

**Sion:**
Though it's a separate matter to what we've now identified as the alien world of CHALDEAS, but anyway... 

**Sion:**
My analysis of Subject: E is complete. Would you like hear the report, Commander Gordolf? 

**Gordolf:**
R-Right, we did have that question remaining as well! The amount of incomprehensible facts increasing even further does bother me, but... 

![](https://i.imgur.com/kTkfWiy.png)

**Gordolf:**
Things won't get better by refusing to listen! You are permitted to deliver your report! But make it quick! 

**Sion:**
First, I'll start with the information we were able to analyze. 

**Sion:**
We've now learned that the mysterious facility that our investigation team of Fujimaru, Mash, and Kadoc entered is... 

**Sion:**
...actually a research facility that exists in our world as well. 

**Sion:**
Its purpose was to research some kind of outer space-originating object that had been secretly brought into Area 51, Nevada. 

**Sion:**
We weren't able to examine the more intricate equipment, but according to the information recorded by Mash's Ortenaus... 

**Sion:**
The place is a 99% match with what TRISMEGISTUS calculates to be an Area 51 research facility. 

**Sion:**
Which is to say that the facility in which Subject: E was located is a place which has its origins in Pan-Human History. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/6kSHo3E.png)

**Kadoc:**
Yeah... I guess that adds up. 

**Kadoc:**
That building felt really out-of-place for a location in the large-scale Singularity. 

**Kadoc:**
It wouldn't be odd to assume that the Singularity came into being with that operating room as its epicenter. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/vQW2Ld9.png)

**Da Vinci:**
Yep. I'm of the same opinion. It ties into the question of what kind of person the Master was, 

**Da Vinci:**
given the massive number of Servants that were summoned in the Singularity. 

**Da Vinci:**
In my opinion, it was only that operating room that was from Pan-Human History. Or rather, was from a planet exceedingly close to that of Pan-Human History. 

**Da Vinci:**
A facility located at the Nevada within CHALDEAS... Or maybe I'm pushing this conclusion too far? 

![](https://i.imgur.com/TRUjIxt.png)

**Mash:**
Wait... if only that facility was part of CHALDEAS... 

**Mash:**
Then, does that mean the cosmic-looking corridor was actually moving us between the different worlds? 

**Da Vinci:**
Most likely, yes. There's this thing known as Substitution Magecraft in the world of magecraft. 

**Da Vinci:**
For instance, let's say we have a Gordolf A and a Gordolf B here. 

**Da Vinci:**
In the case that they have the exact same makeup and information load, they could “swap” places no matter how distant they are to one another. 

**Da Vinci:**
And how come? Well, obviously because from a third party's point of view, they aren't different in the slightest. 

**Da Vinci:**
Only the substituted people will know that they've been swapped. Actually, depending on the circumstances, not even they would know. 

**Da Vinci:**
Magecraft works best when something supernatural happens but the world can't notice the difference. 

**Gordolf:**
Mm. It's magecraft that's thought to be theoretically possible, at least. The larger the object, the more difficult it is, however. 

**Gordolf:**
I'm fairly certain I've heard it was being researched by some old lineage that doesn't affiliate with the Clock Tower. 

**Gordolf:**
Also, I'd appreciate if you didn't use me as the example there. 

**Gordolf:**
If an A or a B got attached to the end of my name all of a sudden, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night anymore. 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Substitution... swapping...


---

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So the reason Earth was suddenly bleached could've been...


---

**Kadoc:**
Because the surface of Earth and the surface of CHALDEAS were swapped? 

**Da Vinci:**
After all, miniature or not, CHALDEAS is indeed an identical entity to that of Earth, created by copying its soul, right. 

**Da Vinci:**
The difference in size isn't a big issue. As long as the information content and makeup of their souls are the same, swapping them is possible. 

**Da Vinci:**
Honestly, more so than the nature of the Bleached Earth, the way it was carried out was always the more mysterious part. 

**Da Vinci:**
Because it's impossible to destroy the entirety of Earth's civilization in an instant without harming the planet itself. 

**Mash:**
But if instead, it was swapped out for something that had already been bleached, then you wouldn't have to hurt it...? 

**Da Vinci:**
Right, which tells us that for CHALDEAS, our world, Earth, is still completely unhurt. 

**Da Vinci:**
Meaning that as long as we restore the relationship between CHALDEAS and Earth to normal, your future will once again proceed as normal. 

**Kadoc:**
Everything will go back to normal, huh... 

**Kadoc:**
When the Earth was bleached, human history stopped at 2017. So it would just go back to operation normally as it was before. 

**Kadoc:**
But, wait... CHALDEAS simulates the Earth as it is 100 years in the future. 

**Kadoc:**
In that case, the facility would be one from 2117. But when you think about it from that perspective, like... 

**Sion:**
You're wondering why the facility was built using the same technology as found in 2017... basically, wouldn't that be too old? 

**Sion:**
That bothered me as well. 

**Sion:**
I immediately realized that the room was part of CHALDEAS' interior, but... 

**Sion:**
You couldn't have taken it as using cutting-edge technology from 2117. However, according to the data, Subject: E's time of death was just a few days prior. 

**Sion:**
If that room was CHALDEAS, then Subject: E is a being that died in 2117. 

**Sion:**
And yet, the level of the technology there was the same as ours in 2017. 

**Sion:**
I was afraid I'd be unable to explain anything if I didn't solve that contradiction, but... 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Could it simply be that...


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The equipment couldn't be upgraded...?


---

**Sion:**
Spot-on! It seems false, or even planned like complete nonsense, but that's correct! 

![](https://i.imgur.com/MFALK1i.png)

**Sion:**
The fact that there's a 100-year disparity remains, and so, we have no choice but to assume that the equipment couldn't be upgraded. 

**Gordolf:**
Uh-huh? Is that really so likely? 

**Sion:**
Let's just assume that there were some circumstances that forced it to be like that. 

**Sion:**
Such as a lack of budget or personnel. 

**Sion:**
In Pan-Human History, the top secret facility of Area 51 had been long-since closed down, since around 2001. 

**Sion:**
The research budget they received from the government was cut off. 

**Sion:**
In a similar fashion, the facility on the Earth of CHALDEAS must've most likely ran into some kind of problem. 

**Da Vinci:**
Well... I won't deny the possibility... 

**Da Vinci:**
After all, securing a budget is the top priority and yet also the most difficult task for researchers. 

**Da Vinci:**
However, there's a massive distinction to be made between the facility found on Earth, and the one in CHALDEAS. 

**Da Vinci:**
I'm obviously talking about Subject: E. Given that this lifeform actually existed there... 

**Da Vinci:**
The facility on the Earth of CHALDEAS must've accomplished something the one in Pan-Human History did not. 

**Da Vinci:**
In which case, it'd be logical to think the opposite happened, and it was injected with enough funding to run a country. 

**Sion:**
As I said, it “ran into some kind of problem”. The reason itself isn't important, so let's keep going, okay? 

**Sion:**
The remains we discovered in the operating room had the exact same biological composition as that of us humans. 

**Sion:**
And despite that, TRISMEGISTUS II did not deem those remains to be that of an “Earthling”. 

**Sion:**
Not because it wasn't, but because it couldn't. His values were identical, yet different all the same&mdash; 

**Sion:**
Because of this logic error, TRISMEGISTUS II could not give a conclusive answer to what Subject: E was. 

**Sion:**
At the very last stage of its calculations, it managed to apply the label of “human” to it, before freezing. 

**Sion:**
As such, I put that conclusion on hold, and asked it to just analyze the situation. 

**Sion:**
And when I did, the information lined up immediately. 

**Sion:**
1st Finding: Subject: E was a human from the Earth of CHALDEAS. 

**Sion:**
2nd Finding: If the Bleached Earth is CHALDEAS' surface, then the mankind of CHALDEAS have already perished. 

**Sion:**
3rd Finding: The equipment used in the research facility of CHALDEAS' Earth were antiques, therefore.... 

**Sion:**
All technology developed in the 100-year span of 2017 to 2117 has become malfunctional. 

**Sion:**
This is something that can be deduced from the structures that still remain on the Bleached Earth. 

**Sion:**
If there are machines that could operate on the Bleached Earth, they would be antiques from 100 years prior. 

**Sion:**
Something like a motorcycle, or some such, that uses a simple combustion engine, perhaps. 

**Sion:**
That is all which can be theorized from Subject: E. With that in mind... 

**Sion:**
If we want to ask ourselves why Subject: E become a Master... 

**Sion:**
Why he summoned that many Servants, and why the large-scale Singularity came into being, then it could only be&mdash; 

![](https://i.imgur.com/vGxAxus.png)

**Kadoc:**
Revenge... The Earth of CHALDEAS was bleached. 

**Kadoc:**
Who knows how exactly, but we know the reason why. 

**Kadoc:**
It was bleached in order to prepare for the swap between the our Earth and that of CHALDEAS. 

**Kadoc:**
Subject: E knew this, and that's why he applied the impulse for revenge on his Servants. 

**Kadoc:**
Basically, retribution against those who brought his world to ruin... Retribution against Pan-Human History. 

**Kadoc:**
Subject: E was fully aware that he was the last of all mankind. 

**Kadoc:**
Being the last person left in CHALDEAS's Earth essentially made him their Representative of Mankind. 

**Kadoc:**
In fact... it'd be impossible if that wasn't the case, considering the number of Servants involved. 

**Kadoc:**
Summoning that many Servants is impossible for a single individual. 

**Kadoc:**
The will of the dead people of CHALDEAS' Earth made it possible to summon such a massive number of Servants. 

**Kadoc:**
The bizarre number of Command Spells makes perfect sense then. 

**Kadoc:**
Those were probably the Command Spells of the people from the Earth of CHALDEAS who had the potential to be a Master. 

**Kadoc:**
And that corpse... 

**Kadoc:**
It must've been someone like you; a nameless nobody who was saddled with mankind's future.

**Fujimaru 1:**

**Fujimaru 2:**
...(Wait, but that's...)

![](https://i.imgur.com/lbDWTpw.png)

**Moriarty:**
You've obtained the information on Subject: E. 

**Moriarty:**
It's Chaldea's own job to analyze what Subject: E is... but I can kick in a freebie or two. 

**Moriarty:**
That is no life form native to the Earth. 

**Moriarty:**
It's the remains of a creature who spent a century in that laboratory concealed, examined, and experimented on. 

**Moriarty:**
I believe that its death throes called its kin, the Alien God... 


---

**Gordolf:**
Wait, wait, wait! 

**Gordolf:**
Whatever happened on the Earth of CHALDEAS is unfortunate, but it's not something we can do anything about! 

**Gordolf:**
There's no need for us to feel any guilt over it! Right now, we need to establish a proper timeline! 

**Gordolf:**
If I remember correctly, there was documentation that by the time of 2015 when our Fujimaru here arrived at Chaldea... 

**Gordolf:**
CHALDEAS had already entered a state where the future of mankind could not be observed. 

**Gordolf:**
Had CHALDEAS already been bleached by this point? How does that work!? 

![](https://i.imgur.com/7oO2zr3.png)

**Meunière:**
No, it hadn't. Sure, Singularity F happened, and the light of civilization had faded here and there, 

**Meunière:**
But the surface of CHALDEAS was the same as that of Earth's. 

**Meunière:**
It was SHEBA which announced that the security of human history couldn't be observed beyond 2016. 

**Meunière:**
That's something we can all vouch for. 

**Meunière:**
And given what would come after, SHEBA was right. Whether it was the Incineration of the Human Order, or the Bleaching, there was no future. 

**Meunière:**
The Earth of CHALDEAS was probably bleached after the Incineration had been resolved. 

**Meunière:**
Though it does mean we were tricked by CHALDEAS when we were in the middle of dealing with the special circumstances of 2017. 

**Gordolf:**
&mdash;Hmm... So basically, CHALDEAS was in perfect order before the Rayshift experiment of 2015. 

**Gordolf:**
Or rather, it had yet to reveal its malicious true colors. 

**Gordolf:**
Which means it's possible to assume that Solomon's Human Order Incineration was unexpected, and that if that hadn't happened... 

**Gordolf:**
CHALDEAS was arranged to cause this current state of affairs at the end of 2016. 

**Gordolf:**
Solomon, or more accurately, Goetia, happened to throw a wrench into Marisbury's plans by accident. 

**Gordolf:**
So perhaps the plan to swap CHALDEAS and Earth was delayed by the emergence of Singularity F? 

**Da Vinci:**
Oh, I see. The explosion in the control room wasn't part of Former Director Marisbury's plan, after all. 

**Da Vinci:**
As such, it helped create the strange situation that came about afterward, the one we currently have on our hands. 

**Da Vinci:**
It's Olga Marie. When Lev Lainur threw her into CHALDEAS, something must've surely gone wrong somewhere. 

**Sion:**
... 

**Sion:**
That is all for the information I can disclose about Subject: E. 

**Sion:**
Through this theorizing, we've uncovered about 80% of what the purpose behind CHALDEAS' creation is. 

**Sion:**
It's to swap out Earth, or more accurately, mankind&mdash; 

**Sion:**
The objective of the person who created CHALDEAS, Former Director Marisbury Animusphere, was to turn Earth into what we see before us. 

**Sion:**
So then the next thing we then need to think about is what exactly he would have gained by doing that. 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah... Bleaching the Earth...


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Who would benefit from it, and how?


---

![](https://i.imgur.com/anRFNfo.png)

**Sion:**
Sure is a thinker, that one... Neither me nor TRISMEGISTUS II have been able to come up with an answer to this question. 

**Sion:**
Goetia wished for life without death; a planet without death. Kirschtaria wished for the advancement of mankind. 

**Sion:**
And Daybit tried to destroy the entire Earth together with CHALDEAS for the sake of, in his own words, “the good name of the Earthlings”. 

**Sion:**
Even if we couldn't sympathize with them, they all had understandable motives. 

**Sion:**
The Bleaching of the Earth, on the other hand, just doesn't make sense. I can't see what the ultimate goal here is. 

**Gordolf:**
Did he just give up on mankind, perhaps? You know, wipe out mankind and purify Earth. 

**Kadoc:**
Marisbury...wasn't that kind of person. He wasn't a nihilist or a pessimist. 

**Kadoc:**
He was a genuine magus, one who delighted in mankind's prosperity and desired the advancement of learning. 

**Da Vinci:**
Makes sense. If he hadn't been that kind of person... 

**Da Vinci:**
Then King Solomon wouldn't have answered his summons and cooperated with him during the Holy Grail War in Fuyuki. 

**Da Vinci:**
Marisbury was most certainly an honest and respectable magus. However... 

**Da Vinci:**
Honest and respectable comes in all sorts and kinds. Much in the same fashion as Daybit... 

**Da Vinci:**
Marisbury's objective must be something where the logic is so extreme we cannot conceive of it as “honest and respectable”. 

**Kadoc:**
Maybe so... He was a Lord from the Clock Tower, after all. 

**Kadoc:**
His standard of what constitutes “prosperity” must be far different from how we imagine it. 

**Da Vinci:**
Yep. We've now been able to establish only that our Earth is fine, and what the condition of CHALDEAS is like. 

**Da Vinci:**
Everything will become clear to us at the Antarctic. Nemo, how long until we arrive? 

**Nemo:**
Excellent timing. We will now be entering into the Antarctic. 

**Nemo:**
Nothing which could obstruct our advance can be observed. We will now proceed toward Chaldea Ba&mdash; 

![](https://i.imgur.com/YMmDd9G.png)

**Nemo:**
Decelerate! Change course! There's a barrier! Alerting all crew to brace for impact! 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's going on&mdash;!?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Didn't you just say nothing could be observed!?


---

**Sion:**
SHEBA didn't even alert us! No hostile readings or any gravitational field emerged either! 

**Sion:**
And yet, we were still repelled! Was it air pressure high enough to push back the Storm Border or something!? 

**Gordolf:**
Damn, I knew it wouldn't be so simple! 

**Gordolf:**
Is the Alien God, or rather, CHALDEAS attacking us!? Technical Advisor, opinions, please! 

**Da Vinci:**
That's the thing! There is no activity coming from the Antarctic! This barrier has nothing to do with it! 

**Mash:**
No, listen everyone. That is in all likelihood... the Wall of Human Order. 

**Mash:**
I know about this kind of protection. It's like Heroic Spirit Galahad's Noble Phantasm, Lord Camelot. 

**Mash:**
It's the same force powering this wall. The Antarctic is being protected by the Securing of the Human Order! 

**Nemo:**
We've now circled all around the Antarctic, but the barrier covers every single spot of it. 

**Nemo:**
Neither assault via the Storm Border's Dimensional Penetration nor incursion via the Shadow Border's Zero Sail are viable. 

**Nemo:**
The exact reason is unknown, but no matter what we do, we're repelled. This is the first time I've run into such an obnoxious barrier. 

**Nemo:**
Its lack of physical form means it cannot be destroyed either. Trying to use special kinds of navigation gets them cancelled. 

**Nemo:**
I don't have the slightest clue what the logic behind this thing is. 

**Gordolf:**
How frustrating! Our destination is right in front of our noses, and yet we can't even get close! 

**Gordolf:**
Technical Advisor, Sion, is there nothing we can do!? Isn't it about time you got done with that analysis you're so proud of!? 

**Sion:**
No way at all. I don't have the slightest idea either. What even is this? Are we being humiliated or something? 

**Da Vinci:**
Yeah. Get close, and it appears, go back and it disappears. 

**Da Vinci:**
And for all it refuses to let us through, it still inflicts basically no damage on us. 

**Da Vinci:**
It's also impossible to observe where it's getting all its energy from. Not even the Walls of Storms were this bad. 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Both of them are throwing in the towel...


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
If it's the same as Lord Camelot, then...

**Mash:**
... 


---

**???:**
Naturally. With the Seven Lostbelts excised, CHALDEAS has become the keystone of human history—the Celestial Sphere of Human Order Assurance. 

**???:**
That wall is not protecting CHALDEAS, it's more like a migration checkpoint which refuses to admit the foreign. 

**???:**
The Antarctic isn't obstructing you, you yourselves are repelling Pan-Human History. 

**Mash:**
This voice&mdash;

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hey, look on deck!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's

**Da Vinci:**
“Romani Archaman”! Marine, pick up his voice! 

![](https://i.imgur.com/8PHniWd.png)

**Nemo Marine:**
Understood! Redirecting cameras! 

![](https://i.imgur.com/Q6G3l5S.png)

**Romani Archaman:**
Beyond here lies the domain of the “complete” Pan-Human History. You cannot trespass upon it as you are now. 

**Romani Archaman:**
&mdash;Not something I'd been expecting either, but&mdash; 

**Romani Archaman:**
Throughout your battles up until now, you have made excessive use of things that aren't from Pan-Human History. 

**Romani Archaman:**
Servants from outside of the Seven Classes. Rulers, Alter-Egos, and Avengers. 

**Romani Archaman:**
As a result of abusing such ordinarily impossible classes, you are now being perceived as foreign entities. 

**Romani Archaman:**
If you do not correct this distortion, it will be impossible for you to approach CHALDEAS. 

**Romani Archaman:**
You can't bring those Classes into the future beyond 2017... Actually, that's not quite right. 

**Romani Archaman:**
You won't be able to bring them with you with your current perception. 

**Romani Archaman:**
Fujimaru. The gears turning within you are out of sync. 

**Romani Archaman:**
Why do these ordinarily impossible attributes exist? 

**Romani Archaman:**
Exactly how ought their weapons and their character be of service to human history? 

**Romani Archaman:**
Once you've understood and assessed this, your foreignness will surely be no more. 

**Romani Archaman:**
&mdash;Turn your ship around, Novum Chaldea. 

**Romani Archaman:**
The regions of your distortions, where you'll come to reckon with the sins you've committed unaware, are most definitely to be found. 

**Romani Archaman:**
Ordeal Call. The duty you must fulfill beckons for you. 

**Romani Archaman:**
Once four... no, three reckonings have been completed, the truth of the celestial sphere will come to light. 

**Romani Archaman:**
The parting will invariably come. So go acquire the strength of mind needed to take in that moment. 

**Sion:**
The answer by TRISMEGISTUS II has come in. The accusation made by the mysterious stranger appears to have hit the mark. 

**Sion:**
“The barrier surrounding the Antarctic is close to a self-purification function, and the cause of it lies within ourselves.” 

**Sion:**
As much as it pains me to say, from the Human Order's perspective, we are basically like a pack of outlaws right now. 

**Sion:**
We ourselves are denying our entry into the pure lands of the Antarctic, or something like that. 

**Mash:**
I had suspected it was something like that. It wasn't an attack, but a warning. 

**Mash:**
Normally, the Extra Classes are something which are beyond human control. So abusing them would obviously exclude us from the Human Order. 

**Meunière:**
It's sort of like we've been using weapons outlawed by international humanitarian law with reckless abandon. 

**Meunière:**
Guilty as can be, aren't we... Oh. 

**Meunière:**
Sorry... Should've chosen my words carefully. It was just an metaphor, nothing more... 

**Mash:**
I know. Thank you for clarifying, Meunière. 

**Mash:**
However, fact is fact. If CHALDEAS was created with an evil purpose in mind, then... 

**Mash:**
It is only right that the Demi-Servant experiment is to be suspected of being something similarly wicked. 

**Mash:**
In light of that, it will be up to my own deeds to demonstrate the ethics of my own being. 

**Mash:**
There are plenty of futures to choose, even for someone born out of injustice. 

**Mash:**
Fortunately, I have been granted the power of protection. In no way, shape, or form could such a power be something wicked. 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Yeah, you're right.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You always knew that, didn't you, Mash?


---

**Gordolf:**
... (Well said, Mash Kyrielight.) 

**Gordolf:**
(However, once outsiders come to learn of this incident, it's obvious you'll all be criticized for your actions.) 

**Gordolf:**
(As for what I can do for them... I'm not sure. But there must be something I can do so this pack of fools end up being rewarded.) 

**Da Vinci:**
&mdash;Yeah. The Chaldea that Marisbury established was truly one of evil. 

**Da Vinci:**
However, what came afterward was undeniably one of good. 

**Da Vinci:**
After the course of events during the Rayshift experiment of 2015, the Chaldea of Director Marisbury came to an end. 

**Da Vinci:**
Spiritually, and physically. 

**Da Vinci:**
The only staff remaining were a dozen or so normal people who didn't know of Marisbury's true intentions... 

**Da Vinci:**
As well as Romani Archaman, spurned on by his duty to prevent the Incineration of the Human Order. 

**Da Vinci:**
From then on, Chaldea was a different organization. 

**Da Vinci:**
Rather than one meant to secure the future that the Animusphere had thought up and obsessed with, it was one meant to secure the manifold futures that humans dream of. 

**Da Vinci:**
And that won't be changing anytime soon. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/CkPlQbf.png)

**Da Vinci:**
No worries, if there's some sort of problem with us, we'll just have to solve it with pluck and smarts like we always do☆ 

**Da Vinci:**
That person from before said there were “distortions”. 

**Da Vinci:**
So some Singularity-like aberrations must have formed elsewhere while we were hindered by this defect. 

**Da Vinci:**
We need to prove our own innocence by discovering these. We'll take care of the Antarctic afterward. 

**Nemo:**
You mean we're bringing the ship about, got it. I have no objections to that as captain. 

**Nemo:**
I was just thinking we should go back to the regions with still buildings standing to resupply anyway. 

**Gordolf:**
&mdash;Very well. It's not like I thought things would go so smoothly regardless. 

**Gordolf:**
I suppose I'll just have to keep you all company a bit longer. Let's go all out, why don't we? 

**Sion:**
Given that I'm an alchemist from the Atlas Institute, being treated as a criminal due to the abuse of weaponry does hit quite the sore spot. 

**Sion:**
I mean, isn't like half of this... or maybe at least a third of it, kinda my fault? 

**Sion:**
So, of course, I have no objections. 

**Sion:**
I'll support you all in your search, together with TRISMEGISTUS II, of course. 

**Da Vinci:**
That's the situation... How do you feel about it, Fujimaru? 

**Da Vinci:**
It does mean the goal at the end of our journey will have to wait a bit, though. 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
&mdash;Of course! It'd be my pleasure!


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I appreciate everyone helping us out!


---

**Da Vinci:**
Great! Then let us begin the Storm Border's worldwide search! 

**Da Vinci:**
You could think of it as a warmup before we come face-to-face with CHALDEAS. Since we'll get the opportunity to resupply, it's practically all we could ask for. 

**Da Vinci:**
That said, this is no doubt an unprecedented search into the unknown. 

**Da Vinci:**
The distortions accumulated throughout our battles so far... The abuses of the Human Order we have to confront. 

**Da Vinci:**
It doesn't sit right with me to borrow the words of that person from before, but it's easy to understand, so let's go with it. 

**Da Vinci:**
Operation “Ordeal Call”! Once we have overcome these trials, our final destination awaits!

## Ordeal Call 0

![](https://i.imgur.com/HOfzl0a.png)

**Da Vinci:**
Good, everyone's here. Sorry for calling on you all out of the blue. 

**Da Vinci:**
“The distortions accumulated throughout our battles so far... The abuses of the Human Order we have to confront.” 

**Da Vinci:**
“Operation 'Ordeal Call'! Once we have overcome these trials, our final destination awaits!” 

**Da Vinci:**
Despite all our declarations like this, the operations department had been wholly unable to come up with a strategy or course of action. 

**Da Vinci:**
But that disgrace ends today! Indeed, the reason I gathered you all here today is for one simple reason: 

**Da Vinci:**
A proof of innocence to grant us entry to Antarctica. 

**Da Vinci:**
I will unveil to you the details to rectify the “distortions” which we have accumulated! 

**Gordolf:**
Oh, how very good! 

**Gordolf:**
Loitering around the bleached Earth with nothing to go on was only serving to make me depressed! 

**Gordolf:**
So what is it then? What is the weak point which we will target? 

**Gordolf:**
When you say “distortion”, I presume you mean Singularity, of which we who have surmounted seven Lostbelts no longer have anything to fear. 

**Gordolf:**
Come then, let's restore it and set sail for Antarctica right away, why don't we? What do you say, Fujimaru? 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Singularities are always dangerous. Even now.

**Kadoc:**
You're probably right... Lostbelts represent a single history, so although their scale is much greater, the hostility of them is scarce. 

**Kadoc:**
Singularities, on the other hand, no matter how much smaller they may be in scale, do pose a threat to Pan-Human History. 

**Kadoc:**
It's not really fair to make a comparison as to which is easier in the first place. Besides... 

**Mash:**
The Paper Moon shows nothing out of the ordinary. No Singularities seem to have been located as of now... 


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But the Paper Moon shows nothing out of the ordinary...


---

**Da Vinci:**
Precisely. There have been no Singularities discovered for us to engage with. 

**Da Vinci:**
The words spoken by “Romani Archaman” could be summed up as “Solve for x”, 

**Da Vinci:**
but we haven't been able to find any places of abnormality on the bleached Earth. In other words, a “question sheet” doesn't even exist. 

**Nemo:**
Right, if there's no enemy on the radar, there's nothing to torpedo in the first place. I feel like an orca in a sea devoid of whales. 

**Nemo:**
It's been several weeks now that we've been flying around, looking for a Singularity, but we've come up empty-handed, as you're well aware. 

**Nemo:**
There are neither charts nor compass to navigate by here. 

**Nemo:**
I even blurted out one time that it even being a Lostbelt would have been so much better. 

**Gordolf:**
Mm. Rather than smooth sailing, it would be more appropriate to say that there has been nothing but a perfect lull... It's no wonder I've been putting on weight... 

**Gordolf:**
So what do we do, then? If there is nothing to find on the surface, then perhaps the sky... 

**Gordolf:**
Yes, what about the altitudes reaching into the stratosphere? 

**Da Vinci:**
That's a last resort. The Storm Border isn't a spaceship, so I would prefer to avoid having to use it as one. 

**Da Vinci:**
Rather, what's actually the case is that we were mistaken from the start. The idea of “Find the solution” was erroneous. 

**Da Vinci:**
After all, the enemy this time is not “external”, but “internal”&mdash;inside Chaldea. 

**Da Vinci:**
If you were repelling abnormalities as the Human Order Security encapsulating Antarctica, what's the first thing you'd scrutinize? 

**Da Vinci:**
Do you have any idea, Fujimaru? 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Enforce the dress code?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Ensure nobody drunk gets by?


---

**Da Vinci:**
Just so. In order to make that happen, we first have to understand what “state we're in right now”. 

**Da Vinci:**
And for that purpose&mdash;

**Nemo Professor:**
Finally, I was so tired of waiting~. I'm so happy it's finally my turn to speeaaak~. 

**Nemo Professor:**
Now then, eyes up front, please. 

**Nemo Professor:**
This new device was created at the request of Da Vinci, produced in collaboration with Sion... 

![](https://i.imgur.com/5F59AmS.png)

**Nemo Professor:**
It's name is the “Human Order Foundation Display”~. 

**Gordolf:**
Oh? A Human Order Foundation Display. So it's&mdash; what is it? 

**Nemo Professor:**
It's exactly what it sounds like~. We put emphasis on clarity this time, see? 

**Nemo Professor:**
It's different from the Human Order Foundation Value measurement, as it doesn't analyze the Human Order Foundation of an entire human history. 

**Nemo Professor:**
Rather, it measures that of the Storm Border itself. An “event discrepancy measurement/tuning meter”, in other words. 

**Nemo Professor:**
Sion, would you elaborate~? 

![](https://i.imgur.com/b2OTIZA.png)

**Sion:**
It's simple enough. No different than having your baggage checked when entering a country. 

**Sion:**
The value on the display shows Chaldea's—or everyone's, I should say—current “distortion”. 

**Sion:**
At present, it's at E. That's the worst possible rank. 

**Sion:**
TRISMEGISTUS II declared that when we manage to get it back to A, we will be able to cross over the “Wall of the Human Order” in Antarctica. 

**Gordolf:**
Oh... That's rather dreadful. Are we really at the lowest rank? 

**Sion:**
We are. One really has to wonder how we managed to take it this far without noticing anything. What do you think, Fou? 

**Fou:**
Fou, foufou. Fou. 

**Meunière:**
But how are you proposing that we restore our Human Order Foundation? 

**Meunière:**
We haven't been able to find any Singularities, right? So are we just supposed to keep sitting here on our hands? 

**Sion:**
We are. At least for now. It is the best, and arguably the only correct thing we can do. 

**Sion:**
I've already discussed this with Da Vinci, but Romani Archaman used the word “call”. 

**Sion:**
I don't think the implication is for us to be “called in”, but rather that “we will call” for something. 

**Sion:**
As soon as I started thinking about it like this, I started to understand. 

**Sion:**
The “Human Order Foundation Display” is not just a measuring device, but also something to help make things clear. 

**Sion:**
It was devised as an internal/external alarm, basically screaming “Hey look, there are serial rule violators here!”, 

**Sion:**
and a signal to call the countless past ordeals of order restoration back to us. 

**Mash:**
Calling out...ordeals... 

**Mash:**
In hindsight, that seems correct. A distortion of the body is something to be mended by one's own hands. 

**Mash:**
There isn't actually anything wrong with the world itself. 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see.


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Then...it's finally time for


---

**Da Vinci:**
Indeed. We finally stand at the precipice of these ordeals. We have sounded the Ordeal Call. 

**Da Vinci:**
What is our offense against the Human Order? What must we do to atone? 

**Da Vinci:**
When given those questions, TRISMEGISTUS II replied: 

**Da Vinci:**
“Your wrongdoing is a lack of awareness. Rather than utilizing them thoughtlessly, you must understand for what reason each of them exist.” 

**Da Vinci:**
“Assertation. Comprehension. Separation.” “Possibly also consignment. An oath.” 

**Da Vinci:**
“You must answer these questions. Each time you do, a distortion will be rectified.” 

**Da Vinci:**
Well, as things are right now, I really have no idea what it's trying to say. 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Rather than utilizing them thoughtlessly&mdash;)


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(Understand the meaning of each existence)


---

![](https://i.imgur.com/TFibsrK.png)

**Nemo:**
It's fine, there's no need to overthink it right now, Fujimaru. 

**Nemo:**
After all, we're not sailing toward the ordeals. They will come our way. 

**Nemo:**
We just have to prepare ourselves. When the time comes, we simply have to give it all we got. 

**Nemo:**
&mdash;Alright. Now then, this is our strategy! 

**Nemo:**
The ship will continue investigating the bleached Earth, while we strengthen ourselves in preparation for the approaching final battle. 

**Nemo:**
To be more specific&mdash;we are now able to enhance servant classes! 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Class enhancement...?


---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're kidding... (Is this new?)


---

**Nemo:**
Not kidding at all. It's something that's been under development for quite some time now. 

**Nemo:**
Our “Human Order Foundation Value” has decreased significantly. 

**Nemo:**
With the seven Lostbelts excised, the base foundations of human history have greatly improved. 

**Nemo:**
Meaning that the summon spells that utilize human history as the information source to call upon Heroic Spirits have gained a much firmer platform. 

**Nemo:**
Da Vinci and Sion have called this a “Class Score”. 

**Nemo:**
Class Score enhancement does not apply to any individual Heroic Spirit, but to an entire class. All servants within that class will be strengthened. 

**Nemo:**
Strengthening your score will aid you in the fight ahead, 

**Nemo:**
and TRISMEGISTUS II predicts that it will be our ace in the hole in the final fight against the Alien God. 

**Nemo:**
If you want to learn more, please ask Professor later. 

**Nemo:**
That concludes my report from the ship. Now then&mdash; 

**Nemo:**
I want you to remain cautious, and work hard to hone your self-discipline. I expect great things from each and every one of you!
