## Prologue  
  
**Chaldea staff A:**  
Well, that's a problem.   
  
**Chaldea staff B:**  
Yeah, and I haven't the faintest idea what caused it.  
I'll see if article Q-23 of the manual has any answers.   
  
**Chaldea staff B:**  
Let's mark our state as abnormal.   
  
**Chaldea staff C:**  
“Decreased performance and malfunctioning of the  
PAPERMOON due to uncertain causes”...here we go.   
  
**Chaldea staff C:**  
According to the manual... Gather information to  
investigate the event and start recording all your  
progress doing so. Preservation intensity: AA.   
  
**Chaldea staff C:**  
Hereon, the log on the subject's situation, as well as  
all of our inputs and statements will be recorded.  
Thank you for your cooperation.   
  
**Chaldea staff B:**  
Sorry, kinda busy here! You handle the announcement  
to the crew!   
  
**Mash:**  
Ah, Senpai. Have you heard the announcement just  
now?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Something about an abnormality?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Yes. Da Vinci and Sion were called...   
  
**Mash:**  
I speculate it is some sort of technical difficulty,   
  
**Mash:**  
but the announcer's tone made it sound like quite a big  
deal.   
  
**Mash:**  
So I want to see if there is any way I can help.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Same here.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Let's at least take a look.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Yes!   
  
**Mash:**  
&mdash;Is something wrong with PAPERMOON?   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
So it would seem.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
And we were about to ask our puzzled operator-slash-  
manufacturer over there for more details.   
  
**Sion:**  
Hmm... I'm the one who should be asking the  
questions here...   
  
**Sion:**  
By its very nature, it's not something that should be  
causing anyone any issues.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Wait, really?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Yeah. The PAPERMOON might be an exceptional  
measuring device, but using it is extremely simple.   
  
**Sion:**  
There's no uncertainty in its measurements,  
even when operating in harsh environments.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's absolute, otherwise it couldn't serve as a perfect  
compass in Imaginary Number Space.   
  
**Sion:**  
In the simplest possible terms, it's the reflective  
surface of the moon, displaying everything as it exists.   
  
**Sion:**  
Formed or formless. Real or imaginary numbers.   
  
**Sion:**  
No complex processes or calculations necessary.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Yeah, but what about all the black box mechanisms  
inside that you haven't mentioned?   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Even I've never tried tinkering with those out of fear of  
what would happen if I broke anything.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
This thing was gifted to Chaldea a long time ago,  
so a fair share of skilled engineers have had a go at it  
over the years,   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
but until I built the Border, the consensus was...   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
“This is amazing, but I can't think of any use for it.”   
  
**Sion:**  
It's a Mystic Code from the Atlas Institute. What else  
did you expect?   
  
**Sion:**  
It was a present to Chaldea, but its blueprints and  
inner mechanisms are still top secret.   
  
**Sion:**  
A few of its microcomponents are of my family's  
patented technology,   
  
**Sion:**  
so only I can realistically make fundamental changes.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
It's complex...despite its simple functions?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Yes. Well, less complex and more overly customized  
for one user.   
  
**Sion:**  
How do I explain this one? Here's an example.   
  
**Sion:**  
Suppose you have a jigsaw puzzle composed of 100  
million blank white pieces.   
  
**Sion:**  
You glue the complete puzzle together, frame it,  
and hang it on your wall.   
  
**Sion:**  
It is practically a simple poster of the color white.   
  
**Sion:**  
But it's still made up of 100 million small pieces.   
  
**Sion:**  
Glued together, they gained the simplicity of a solid  
block of white.   
  
**Sion:**  
This simplicity drops its chance of being taken apart  
to practically zero.   
  
**Sion:**  
Still, the only way to define it is as an amalgamation  
of 100 million puzzle pieces,   
  
**Sion:**  
and the only way to see how it's made is to find and  
remove each piece... Makes sense, right?   
  
**Mash:**  
Y-yes. I feel like I understand the main gist...somehow.   
  
**Sion:**  
Eh, it's a product from when I had more time on my  
hands than I knew what to do with, before I found my  
current aim.   
  
**Sion:**  
I didn't use any material that would deteriorate easily,   
  
**Sion:**  
and programmed it with a general purpose  
self-maintenance spell, so&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
Continuing with the previous example, my pre-  
examination impression would be:   
  
**Sion:**  
“I, an intellectual, darling daughter of the Atlas  
chancellor, didn't build a puzzle that'd break apart for  
no reason.”   
  
**Sion:**  
But let's take a look.   
  
**Sion:**  
Activate this part here, easy as that.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Hmm, hold up? Is that a Singularity reaction light on  
the monitor?   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Check what that's about!   
  
**Chaldea staff A:**  
I-it is! I can see it&mdash;but...   
  
**Chaldea staff B:**  
No Singularity detected!   
  
**Sion:**  
&mdash;Oh, really?   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Yeah, sorry, but I can definitely confirm its visuals.  
Around Egypt, per the world map.   
  
**Chaldea staff B:**  
No matter how many times I check for input data  
against PAPERMOON, I get nothing.   
  
**Chaldea staff B:**  
There's no logical reason why this would be lit...!   
  
**Sion:**  
It's visible with no input?   
  
**Sion:**  
I can think of two possibilities.   
  
**Sion:**  
One of them is a problem with the display.   
  
**Sion:**  
A burned-in portion of the monitor, a scribble on the  
screen, or something to that effect.   
  
**Sion:**  
A misapprehension unrelated to the data.   
  
**Sion:**  
If not that, then it can only be the second possibility.   
  
**Sion:**  
PAPERMOON is sending a signal to something.   
  
**Sion:**  
A receptor directly connected to it.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
The light is...!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Dazzling...  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**  
What's happening!? All hands, emergency!   
  
**Mash:**  
S-Senpai, are you alright? Senpai! Stay by my...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I can't see anything with all this light&mdash;  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Ugh...  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Where...am I?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Some unfamiliar...city?  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
Finally awake? Always the sleepyhead, aren't you?   
  
**F：Kama:**  
But it's okay. Carelessly falling back asleep in the  
morning is a mark of sloth.   
  
**F：Kama:**  
A basic moral lapse you can practice every day.  
I won't stop you.   
  
**F：Kama:**  
Do return to your sweet dreams.   
  
**F：Kama:**  
It won't be my fault if your lapse ends up being  
permanent.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Huh? Kama...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Where are we? What happened?  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Don't ask me. Your “puppy in the rain” eyes won't  
make me suddenly know the answer.   
  
**Kama:**  
I've also just woken up.   
  
**Kama:**  
Whatever happened to me, it's probably the same  
thing that happened to you.   
  
**Kama:**  
So&mdash;no idea.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Okay...  
  
**Kama:**  
If I were a competent ninja, I might have already  
checked out the area, but that's not the kind of  
Assassin I am.   
  
**Kama:**  
You know me.   
  
**Kama:**  
Instead of acting without orders, I limited myself to  
watching you sleep and caressing your cheeks.  
It was fun.   
  
**Kama:**  
What a shame for you to have me, hehehe.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
But I'm really relieved to have you here, Kama.  
  
**Kama:**  
Wh-wh-where did that come from?   
  
**Kama:**  
I'm not helpful. I'm...you know?   
  
**Kama:**  
Kinda more like an enemy than anything? Your smile  
won't faze me.   
  
**Kama:**  
...Huh? That's not bad, actually...   
  
**Kama:**  
Something's wrong. I'm sure of it. Let's forget it ever  
happened. Okay, forgotten.   
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(I feel dizzy...?)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(But I think I can put up with it.)  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Anyways, we woke up in an unknown place with the  
staff and other Servants nowhere to be found.   
  
**Kama:**  
Your communication thingy isn't usable, so we're cut  
off...   
  
**Kama:**  
What's your plan?   
  
**Kama:**  
I don't wanna work, but I'll have to if I'm the only one  
around.   
  
**Kama:**  
I can get you some information. Treat it as a favor.   
  
**Kama:**  
You decide whether we go together or if I'll be  
checking the path ahead first.   
  
**???:**  
Hold it right there.   
  
**???:**  
Do you not notice your partner...no, your Master's  
condition?   
  
**???:**  
That's serious inattention, there's no other word for it.  
I can tell just from visual information that [♂ he /♀️ she]  
is off-balance.   
  
**???:**  
Is [♂ he /♀️ she]&mdash;sick, perhaps?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I know this voice.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Sion? Are you here, Sion?  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Why are you...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
so small!!!!!?!!?  
  
---  
  
## Section 1: World Within the Compass/meet AI.  
  
### Arrow 1 Pre-Battle  
  
**B：Sion?:**  
&mdash;If you'll excuse me, I'd like to perform a  
physical inspection by touch.   
  
**B：Sion?:**  
Hmm... Temperature, pulse, and pupil dilation are  
normal. You look perfectly stable.   
  
**B：Sion?:**  
Any subjective symptoms?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Not right now, no.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I was a bit dizzy, but it passed.  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
More importantly, are you really...Sion?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Yes. I am Sion Eltnam Sokaris.   
  
**Sion:**  
I wouldn't think we need to be verifying each other's  
names at this point, do we, Fujimaru?   
  
**Kama:**  
Wait, don't be ridiculous. You can't just talk as though  
that were the most natural thing in the world.   
  
**Kama:**  
You're completely different from your usual self.   
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...?   
  
**Sion:**  
How so?   
  
**Sion:**  
Besides, even if my visual information were slightly  
different, that's no big deal. Looks don't matter.   
  
**Sion:**  
I am Sion Eltnam and identify myself as such.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's impossible to recognize me as anything else.   
  
**Sion:**  
The same goes for you, no?   
  
**Sion:**  
Chaldea's Master, Fujimaru.  
And [♂ his /♀️ her] Servant, Kama.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Your personality feels kinda different.  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
...  
...   
  
**Kama:**  
S-U-S!!!   
  
**Kama:**  
She couldn't possibly be more suspicious if she tried!  
Are you really that pixie from the control room?   
  
**Kama:**  
That Sion woman is just an Atlas Institute magus.   
  
**Kama:**  
She's not a shapeshifter like me, as far as I know!   
  
**Sion:**  
Visual hijacking, bodily modification, body  
replacement...   
  
**Sion:**  
Even the most average of Atlas magi can come up  
with hundreds of ways to alter their appearance.   
  
**Sion:**  
I am me. And although I don't remember ever  
modifying my appearance, your statements are still  
purely superficial.   
  
**Sion:**  
And for a counterargument: you're the suspicious one,  
Kama.   
  
**Sion:**  
Considering how many Heroic Spirits  
Fujimaru has under contract, why are you  
the only one here?   
  
**Kama:**  
Because... That's what I want to know, too.   
  
**Sion:**  
Can you prove you're not pretending to be an ignorant  
victim for your own schemes?   
  
**Sion:**  
I remember reading in a report,   
  
**Sion:**  
that you're a Servant who poses a risk to your Master.   
  
**Kama:**  
I don't know a thing about this, honestly. I'm fuzzy  
even on what path took me here.   
  
**Kama:**  
I vaguely remember talking to someone, but it must  
have been my imagination, since I have no solid  
recollection.   
  
**Kama:**  
I feel weirdly lightheaded...   
  
**Kama:**  
But not in the same way I was during our summer fun  
times...   
  
**Sion:**  
I heard no certain statements. Zero usable data.  
Are you doing this on purpose?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
L-let's save this discussion for later...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Wanna explore this place with us?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
&mdash;Fine.   
  
**Sion:**  
That's what I predicted would happen.  
All according to my calculations.   
  
**Kama:**  
Hmph. I'm not responsible for anything that might  
happen to you.   
  
**Kama:**  
And do you have anything more specific than “search  
the area”? Are we three just going to walk around  
willy-nilly?   
  
**Sion:**  
Give me a moment to share the basic premise with  
you.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
What basic premise...?  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
What are you poking the ground for?   
  
**Sion:**  
I was right. I predicted this would be the case from  
the sensation on my skin.   
  
**Sion:**  
This is made of a material I don't recognize.   
  
**Sion:**  
However, the fact that it is unknown will lead to an  
answer. All according to my calculations.   
  
**Sion:**  
This place...no, this world is probably&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
What was that?   
  
**Kama:**  
I did hear something. Not too far away from here.   
  
**Kama:**  
Will we find Villager #1, or Enemy #1?   
  
**Kama:**  
Wanna test your luck?   
  
**Kama:**  
For me, the most fun option is whichever you want the  
least, by the way♪   
  
**Kama:**  
...  
...   
  
**Kama:**  
It's both. Boooooring.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Someone is being chased...!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Indeed. But by what?   
  
**Kama:**  
Good question. What is that thing? Looks like one of  
those Sea Fiends, but not exactly.   
  
**Kama:**  
Either way, it's all gross and gooey. Whoever made it  
has no taste.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
If someone's being attacked, we help them!  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
(Sigh)...   
  
**Kama:**  
Yeah, yeah, I get it. I'm here as your Servant,  
yadda yadda.   
  
**Kama:**  
I'll help. Spare me the fiery glare.   
  
**Kama:**  
Actually, quell all that anger before it gives you an  
ulcer, even.   
  
**Kama:**  
But...you better not forget, okay? The more you use  
me for your needs and desires,   
  
**Kama:**  
the more I'll feel like I can use you for MY needs and  
desires.   
  
**Kama:**  
You've already amassed a lot of debt with me by this  
point, you know?   
  
**Kama:**  
One more step towards further delightful lapse.   
  
**Sion:**  
Since you're attributing numerical value to frustration,  
you need to install yourself with an external display to  
show the values.   
  
**Sion:**  
We need to measure the timing for your maintenances  
and termination.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sion, step away for now...  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Don't worry about me. Atlas magi know how to  
defend themselves.   
  
**Sion:**  
For some reason, I feel like I haven't done this in  
forever, but my skill level is still up-to-date.   
  
**Kama:**  
I don't particularly mind, as long as you don't get in  
my way.   
  
**Kama:**  
I won't take responsibility if a stray arrow of love puts  
you into heat.   
  
**Kama:**  
I've seen enough, stop right there.   
  
**Kama:**  
I don't know what kind of creature you are,  
and I don't feel like interacting with you at all,  
but&mdash;   
  
**Kama:**  
Oh well, just squishing a thing without having to worry  
about love or lapse is easy enough.   
  
### Arrow 1 Post-Battle  
  
**Kama:**  
Wow, I won. Hooray for me~ (Deadpan).   
  
**Kama:**  
Not that it makes any difference to me... Hm?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
What is it?  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Something feels different. Like the way the magical  
energy is flowing, or how my body feels...   
  
**Kama:**  
Well, it doesn't matter, that pest is gone. Shall we  
leave it trampled underfoot?   
  
**Kama:**  
You'd get to be an awesome and cool inhuman Master  
who doesn't care who gets in [♂ his /♀️ her] way.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I'm not gonna do that!  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Tch.   
  
**Kama:**  
But you'd unlock the golden route...lapse caused by  
disapproval and isolation...and I'd be the only one you  
could turn to... (Mumbling).   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I'm more interested in what Sion was doing during the fight.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Just something like a little warmup exercise.  
Nothing to worry about. More importantly&mdash;   
  
**C：???:**  
Who are you...?   
  
**Sion:**  
We're not enemies, at least.   
  
**Sion:**  
I hope that you understand that we're both intelligent  
and good-natured enough to save you from your  
pursuer.   
  
**Sion:**  
How are your injuries?  
Not too bad... Will you need treatment?   
  
**C：???:**  
Unnecessary. Given enough resources and time,  
self-recovery is possible.   
  
**C：???:**  
We are AI designed for care and treatment.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
An AI...?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
(I knew it...)   
  
**Kama:**  
You mean an artificial intelligence?   
  
**C：???:**  
Yes. We are autonomous programs designed to be  
capable of thinking, acting, and conversing without  
direction.   
  
**C：???:**  
Designation: R.A.N.I. series. Type R, for Repair.  
No individual designation.   
  
**C：???:**  
I can provide my serial number if you wish, but that  
does not appear to be necessary.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
R.A.N.I.... Rani?  
  
---  
  
**Rani-R:**  
You pronounce the letters in the acronym together to  
form a name. Logical.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Henceforth it can be used in colloquial speech.   
  
**Sion:**  
An AI is something fundamentally created for a  
specific purpose.   
  
**Sion:**  
Yours appears to be treatment, so what exactly are  
you supposed to be treating?   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Obviously, the other AIs in this area, including the  
other R.A.N.I. types, of course.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Our task is to restore damaged AIs so that all may  
function at maximum capacity.   
  
**Sion:**  
And what's the purpose of you AIs in general?   
  
**Rani-R:**  
I must once again prefix this with an “obviously”.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
&mdash;To ensure the smooth operation of this world.   
  
**Kama:**  
The whole world...? That's kind of a big job, isn't it?   
  
**Sion:**  
Yeah, I figured. Something felt off from the very start.   
  
**Sion:**  
I didn't want to say anything definitive since there  
wasn't enough information to draw a conclusion.   
  
**Sion:**  
If you really are an AI running this world, then you  
ought to be able to clear this up.   
  
**Sion:**  
This place&mdash;it's some kind of conceptual or  
virtual world.   
  
**Sion:**  
Isn't that right?   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Yes. While the information we have available on this  
world is not complete,   
  
**Rani-R:**  
the given name for this place by the “outside” is  
installed into us as basic information.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
PAPERMOON.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
That is the name of this system that we AIs are  
charged with maintaining&mdash;   
  
### Arrow 2 Pre-Battle  
  
**Kama:**  
You mean we're in a virtual world...inside that  
PAPERMOON doohickey?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I can't tell it apart from reality.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Nor should you. This is reality to us.   
  
**Sion:**  
If our consciousness registers that we are here,   
  
**Sion:**  
that means we were made part of this virtual world.   
  
**Sion:**  
The very components of our brains, nerves,  
and sensory devices are forming this world,   
  
**Sion:**  
so if anything in it didn't match reality,   
  
**Sion:**  
our heads wouldn't be able to process that specific  
portion.   
  
**Sion:**  
For example, if a 2 meter tall human owned a 30 cm  
pet,   
  
**Sion:**  
and they were both transported to a world where  
everything was a tenth of its original size,   
  
**Sion:**  
they wouldn't be able to realize they were now a 20  
cm tall human,   
  
**Sion:**  
who owned a 3 cm pet.   
  
**Sion:**  
That said...it doesn't seem like all knowledge and  
sensations were absorbed.   
  
**Sion:**  
There are partial discrepancies.   
  
**Sion:**  
Whatever puzzled you about my appearance must be  
part of it.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's strange that I myself feel nothing wrong with it,  
but I presume something happened to me when  
converted to this world.   
  
**Sion:**  
This phenomenon is probably similar to Spiritron or  
pseudo-Spiritron conversion.   
  
**Sion:**  
Regardless, as long as this virtual world is real to us...   
  
**Sion:**  
If we die here, we die in real life. Be careful.   
  
**Kama:**  
I honestly have no idea what's going on...but there's  
one thing I can tell.   
  
**Kama:**  
This woman is suspicious.   
  
**Kama:**  
PAPERMOON is an item your people provided to us,  
right?   
  
**Sion:**  
Correct.   
  
**Sion:**  
What was used as PAPERMOON's nucleus was  
something originally passed down through generations  
within the Atlas Institute. More specifically, within the  
Eltnam family.   
  
**Sion:**  
The Eltnam family head, Zepia, transferred its control  
to his daughter as a present for her eighth birthday.   
  
**Sion:**  
I performed thorough maintenance and expansion on  
it until I was nine.   
  
**Sion:**  
And it was later offered to Chaldea per their Atlas  
Contract.   
  
**Sion:**  
Naturally, I've been making adjustments since joining  
your group.   
  
**Sion:**  
However, the PAPERMOON is nothing more than a  
device. The only thing inside it is basic software.   
  
**Sion:**  
I have no recollection of creating a world like this  
inside it.   
  
**Sion:**  
I suppose...conceptual worlds simply exist everywhere  
without our notice.   
  
**Sion:**  
As for the AIs, I posit the possibility that a  
self-evolving program transformed into what can be  
considered an AI from a micro-magecraft standpoint.   
  
**Sion:**  
This is fascinating, really.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
So it's only because this world exists,  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
that PAPERMOON works?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Conceptually speaking, correct.   
  
**Sion:**  
Perhaps a clearer way to describe it is saying it was  
forced into this mold.   
  
**Sion:**  
Although I can't give you an exact answer until I  
examine the laws of this world.   
  
**Kama:**  
Someone's dodging the questions...   
  
**Rani-R:**  
If you excuse me, may I interrupt your conversation?   
  
**Sion:**  
I'm sorry, we momentarily forgot about you.  
Let's cut the expository scene for later.   
  
**Sion:**  
Hm? You mentioned your capability to perform  
treatment, but you don't mean the medical kind,  
do you?   
  
**Sion:**  
I don't believe your wound is minor enough to  
withhold healing.   
  
**Sion:**  
If you lack resources, I could provide some.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Check: Applying self-diagnosis program.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Functions currently operating at 37% below standard  
values.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
To fulfill my defined directive and ensure smooth  
operations going forward, it's encouraged that I return  
to standard values,   
  
**Rani-R:**  
but I'm currently prioritizing another routine.   
  
**Sion:**  
So...you can cure your injury but you have a higher  
priority?   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Yes. I'll report it to you.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
In a place distant from here, numerous units of the  
same model as I are under attack from tentacled  
threats like that which you just saw.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
In order to reduce the damage ratio on the Type R  
collective as much as possible,   
  
**Rani-R:**  
I would like your assistance. Will that be possible?   
  
**Kama:**  
Aren't you expecting too much of our good nature?  
We still don't know anything about our situation.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
If your friends are under attack, we'll help.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I think we should all calm down and hear the whole story.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
I figured that's what you'd say.  
All according to my calculations.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Report: They're close. I sense several units of my  
model around this corner.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
However, I can infer&mdash;   
  
**Kama:**  
I knew it, those pests are also here. UGH, what a pain.   
  
**Sion:**  
Then let's get to clearing them. You stay back.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Roger.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
We Repair AI derive joy proportional to the extent of  
the injuries we heal,   
  
**Rani-R:**  
but we're disallowed to inflict harm upon something in  
its perfect state. Please bear that in mind.   
  
### Arrow 2 Post-Battle  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(That dizziness again.)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(But we managed to save them...)  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
It's nice that I could easily defend them and all, but...   
  
**Kama:**  
Are you okay? You look weirdly pale&mdash;   
  
**Kama:**  
Agh, what the heck is this loud noise?   
  
**Kama:**  
Someone's getting really violent around that corner.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Report: Once again, I detect numerous units of my  
model. Many of them seem too injured to move.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Additionally, the prime Repair AI is over there.  
This refers to a position equivalent to a leader amidst  
our type.   
  
**Sion:**  
“Equivalent to”? Strange phrasing. What's the  
practical difference between a prime and a leader?   
  
**Rani-R:**  
The distinction comes because, in the current situation,  
her role was expanded through extra definitions,  
on top of leadership.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
It is recommended that she should be called by her  
additional role.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Which would be&mdash;Master.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...!?  
  
---  
  
**D：???:**  
Ah, no can do, ma'am. I'm too hungry to unleash my  
power. Plus, too unmotivated.   
  
**D：???:**  
I got a critical need for a fine lady's words of  
encouragement, to tell you the truth.   
  
**G：???:**  
C'mon, at least try! Aren't I cheering you up!?   
  
**D：???:**  
Told ya a bunch of times already, but you don't have  
anythin' remotely resembling sex appeal.   
  
**D：???:**  
Can't you change yourself up to cater to my tastes a  
bit more?  
&mdash;Whoa!   
  
**E：???:**  
A man quite confident in his skills, for all your flippant  
attitude.   
  
**E：???:**  
But I've grown tired of this futile dance. It's about time  
for my blade to leave trails of your claret blood.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Servants...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Gilles...!?  
  
---  
  
### Arrow 3 Pre-Battle  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(Lots of girls with the same face here.)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(And also...)  
  
---  
  
**C：???:**  
Hm? Who's there!?   
  
**A：???:**  
Nyeh, fresh troops? Damn, where's my escape  
route&mdash;   
  
**C：???:**  
Hold on, you can't have that as your plan A!  
They're all still here!   
  
**A：???:**  
Like I care! The weak die, that's how life goes!  
Nothing you can do!   
  
**B：???:**  
Hehe, true. That's what commands providence.  
The feeblest are bound to offer their blood and  
deaths as tributes.   
  
**B：???:**  
Well then&mdash;I shall take my dietary supplements.   
  
**C：???:**  
AH!   
  
**J：Rani-R:**  
Report: Serial number 237 lost. Unable to reform.   
  
**Sion:**  
(He absorbed something from that AI? Possibly  
magical energy...well, this world's equivalent to  
it&mdash;)   
  
**Kama:**  
Hmph. That confirms the gloomy-faced man is  
controlling the tentacle creatures.   
  
**Kama:**  
This feels awfully familiar, but what are we doing  
about it?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Keep the girls safe!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Operation goal: Exterminate the tentacle monsters!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
I'll be on lookout in case they try to chase after the  
girls.   
  
**Sion:**  
If the enemy approaches us, I'll at least be able to buy  
some time.   
  
**Sion:**  
I'm counting on you to exterminate them.   
  
**Kama:**  
Sure thing. Go play with your strings while I get to do  
all the hard work.   
  
**Kama:**  
(Sigh) What an annoying chore, but I can tell I'll have  
to do it twice over if I'm not thorough the first time.   
  
**Kama:**  
Maybe a stray arrow could land in that man if I have  
the chance...   
  
### Arrow 3 Post-Battle  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
He's not exactly like the Gilles I know...!  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Yeah. For all the knightly impression he passes,  
his swordsmanship has no real control to it.   
  
**Kama:**  
And there's also the way he controls his familiars.  
Is he just a Caster with a sword?   
  
**B：???:**  
Kehehehe. Well guessed, my class is Caster.  
You have a good eye, beautiful lady.   
  
**Caster:**  
You're a flower with quite the inviting aroma.  
I may take you as my bride once you're a little older.   
  
**Kama:**  
I'll have to pass. Right now I'm busy corrupting this  
blockhead.   
  
**C：???:**  
What's going on? Did you help us...?   
  
**A：???:**  
(Whoa!)   
  
**A：???:**  
O-okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay! Nice work gettin'  
here. I've been waiting for you!   
  
**A：???:**  
I knew you'd make it, my kindred spirit. Together we  
could take on hundreds of them!   
  
**A：???:**  
Now let's us all smack this Caster down together!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Huh?  
  
---  
  
**Caster:**  
...  
...   
  
**Caster:**  
What's our plan, Master?   
  
**F：???:**  
Bah. They already joined hands with another faction?   
  
**F：???:**  
We still haven't collected enough resources to fight  
two Servants at once.   
  
**F：???:**  
We retreat, Caster...   
  
**Caster:**  
Understood. I suppose I'll have to invite you to my  
secret room at a later time.   
  
**Sion:**  
All tentacled creatures around us have vanished.  
I guess we've reached a point where the pacing drops  
off.   
  
**Kama:**  
You know you can't make me bother pursuing them.  
Too much work for one day.   
  
**C：???:**  
W-what's going on? Do you know these people?   
  
**A：???:**  
Phew. All right. Guess I made the right call.   
  
**A：???:**  
Whenever weird people show up unaccounted for,  
you gotta make them allies before they become  
enemies. You never know when they might turn out  
useful.   
  
**A：???:**  
I mean, it's a rarity, but at some point you can dig up a  
real gem like Karna.   
  
**C：???:**  
Stop right there and explain yourself, Berserker!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(He mentioned Karna...?)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(Berserker...)  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Huh, wait, Master?   
  
**Sion:**  
Oh no...! This was a matter that we couldn't have  
postponed.   
  
**Sion:**  
[♂ His /♀️ Her] already established symptoms worsened due to  
the stress of all-out combat.   
  
**Sion:**  
Fujimaru, lie down and take deep  
breaths&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
Fujimaru!?   
  
## Section 2: String and Favor/Rani(ment)  
  
### Arrow 1  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Ugh...?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Are you awake? Excellent.   
  
**Kama:**  
C'mon, sleepyhead, how many times are we going to  
have to repeat this routine?   
  
**Kama:**  
Seriously...  
Stop worrying me like this...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Where are we?  
  
---  
  
**C：???:**  
You're at the partition allocated to the Repair AIs...  
The name of the area is, likewise, Repair.   
  
**C：???:**  
This is Repair's central building.   
  
**C：???:**  
Thank you for saving everyone back then.   
  
**C：???:**  
Mmm, this is one of those moments where I'm  
supposed to be introducing myself, right?   
  
**C：???:**  
I'm the prime R-type AI leading the Repair Area...   
  
**C：???:**  
But I was recently attributed the role of “Berserker's  
Master”.   
  
**C：???:**  
That's what outsiders to our area have mostly been  
calling me lately.   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
And he is&mdash;   
  
**D：???:**  
(Hold up, haven't I explained this to you along the  
road?)   
  
**D：???:**  
(What I said was a stopgap lie. This is a huge  
opportunity to surprise attack them...)   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
(When people help you, you repay the favor!)   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
(I have none of this ingratitude of yours programmed  
in my code!)   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
Err...sorry for the interruption. Let me introduce you to  
Berserker.   
  
**Berserker:**  
Hmph. Fine then.   
  
**Berserker:**  
Plain as day, yours truly is the strongest and most  
beautiful Berserker Servant.   
  
**Berserker:**  
Couldn't tell you why I'm not a Saber, but if I had to  
gander a guess...   
  
**Berserker:**  
I'd say I count as Berserker because I'm mad strong.  
Heheh.   
  
**Kama:**  
Yikes.   
  
**F：Berserker's Master:**  
Uhh. Sorry he's like that.   
  
**Berserker:**  
And I'm quite the intellectual on top of that!  
Oh, the perfection!   
  
**Berserker:**  
The strongest, prettiest, and noblest of all men,  
that's who I am!   
  
**Berserker:**  
It's the public consensus that I'm the greatest friend  
anyone could possibly have, so I'd never deny you the  
privilege of our speaking,   
  
**Berserker:**  
but do remember basic courtesy when addressing me.   
  
**Berserker:**  
Anyway...   
  
**Kama:**  
What are you staring at?   
  
**Sion:**  
Be warned that I'm prepared to counterattack if you  
continue to engage us this impudently.   
  
**Berserker:**  
Hmm. Just checking that we're on the same page here.  
You may be women, but you're too small.   
  
**Berserker:**  
You got nothing to worry about. [♂ Neither /♀️ None] of you struck  
a chord with me.   
  
**Kama:**  
Hm?   
  
**Berserker:**  
Now, a question from me. Are you two Master and  
Servant?   
  
**Berserker:**  
Ah, no need to waste anyone's time with that.  
The Command Spell on your hand answers everything.  
Where're you from?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Tricky question.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Do you know where Chaldea is...?  
  
---  
  
**Berserker:**  
Huh?   
  
**Berserker:**  
Judging by the way you fight, you're either Archer or  
Assassin...right?   
  
**Kama:**  
Yeah, Assassin, why?   
  
**Berserker:**  
You're the only one of your Class, so it's only  
reasonable to ask where you're allocated to...   
  
**Berserker:**  
Hm? Aren't the numbers off?   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
I can see where the miscommunication arose here.   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
Tell me, are you participating in the System Grail War  
or&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
Please wait. We can compare information later.   
  
**Sion:**  
Fujimaru's physical condition hasn't  
improved yet.   
  
**Sion:**  
We need to deal with this major issue first.   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
Ah, yeah, right! Sorry.   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
There's my duty as a repair and treatment AI,  
and my retribution to my personal savior!   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
It's only natural. We exist to treat others.   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
That said... I did run a search on [♂ him /♀️ her] and detected  
nothing.   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
Though, naturally, I could be overlooking something  
since I was made to heal AI.   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
I c-could tell at first glance that you were not AI, okay?   
  
**Sion:**  
I see... I also ran a thorough check-up while [♂ he /♀️ she] was  
asleep.   
  
**Sion:**  
I believe [♂ his /♀️ her] Magic Circuits are not synchronized with  
[♂ his /♀️ her] Spiritron-converted nervous system.   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
You can tell!?   
  
**Sion:**  
It's theoretically possible that in entering this world I  
lost any given amount of my knowledge of magecraft,   
  
**Sion:**  
and I'd be completely unable to tell if that was the  
case...   
  
**Sion:**  
But that just now is the result of an exam I can still  
provide with my current level of awareness.   
  
**Sion:**  
You could say that's my read of it according to this  
world's rules.   
  
**Sion:**  
Regardless, it doesn't alter the factual nature of it for  
those of us here.   
  
**Sion:**  
In summary... [♂ He /♀️ She] is continuously producing junk data  
because the connection between [♂ his /♀️ her] nerves and Magic  
Circuits is unoptimized.   
  
**Sion:**  
This is a structural problem with [♂ his /♀️ her] presence here,  
and one that is inadvisable to ignore.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's likely to grow worse the longer it goes  
unaddressed.   
  
**Kama:**  
Can't we have less stone-faced diagnosis and more  
solving the problem?   
  
**Sion:**  
I will solve it, of course. However, I'm low on options.   
  
**Sion:**  
To be precise, I only have one. It will be quite the  
brute force treatment method. Do you mind?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
If it's the only option...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I'm scared, but go ahead.  
  
---  
  
**F：Berserker's Master:**  
Surgery? Are you going to perform surgery?  
If you need an assistant, count on me or anyone in the  
R Series. Let us learn this!   
  
**Sion:**  
That won't be necessary, and I couldn't possibly  
teach it to you. Only I can use this.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's a microscopic filament. The Spiritron wires  
handed down through the Eltnam family&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
They're called Etherlight.   
  
**Sion:**  
A kind of faux nerve developed originally for medical  
purposes, so I can employ them in this treatment.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Was this what you were using in combat?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
That's right.   
  
**Sion:**  
It didn't have any effect beyond a distraction when  
used against those tentacled creatures, but here it's a  
completely different matter.   
  
**Sion:**  
Fujimaru, close your eyes and lie back  
down.   
  
**Sion:**  
Don't move a muscle.   
  
**Sion:**  
I'll replace your regular nerves with Etherlight,  
then tie them closer to your Circuits. In order to do so...   
  
**Sion:**  
This is indeed the only option. Here we go.   
  
**Sion:**  
&mdash;You can open your eyes now.   
  
**Sion:**  
How do you feel?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Considerably better.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
My head feels so much clearer.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Really? That's great to hear. The operation was a  
success.   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
Wow! I didn't get any of that, but still, it feels great to  
see someone healed!   
  
**Kama:**  
Hmm? Wait a second.   
  
**Kama:**  
Something feels uncomfortable...with my magical  
energy path with Master.   
  
**Sion:**  
I assumed that would be the case... It's an unavoidable  
side-effect.   
  
**Sion:**  
Etherlight can be injected even directly into the brain,   
  
**Sion:**  
but when it comes to Magic Circuits and Spiritron  
conversion, it needs a special route with one additional  
step.   
  
**Sion:**  
Therefore, I used the Command Spell system tied to  
[♂ his /♀️ her] Circuits as an intermediary to force the Etherlight  
route open.   
  
**Sion:**  
In simpler terms...   
  
**Sion:**  
Portions of Fujimaru's Command Spells  
and Magic Circuits have been replaced with my  
Etherlight.   
  
**Sion:**  
And since I'm obviously the one in control,   
  
**Sion:**  
it wouldn't be inaccurate to count me as part of [♂ his /♀️ her]  
Circuits and Command Spells.   
  
**Kama:**  
WHAT!?   
  
**Kama:**  
Hey, are you sure about this!? Circuits and Command  
Spells are pretty important! You can't let anyone other  
than me take parts of that away from you that easy!   
  
**Kama:**  
That's basically giving her control over your life and  
death!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
It was the only way.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
What else could I have done?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
I agree it comes with some ethical issues, but it was  
our only option. I'd appreciate if you thought of it as a  
necessary expense.   
  
**Sion:**  
By the way, from now on, any attempt to utilize your  
Mystic Codes or whatever else you use for magecraft  
will be executed through me.   
  
**Sion:**  
Basically, we have become a two-in-one Master  
package.   
  
**Kama:**  
I've never heard of anything like this. Is this even  
allowed?   
  
**Sion:**  
All I can say in regards to the technical difficulties of  
this mechanism is that we're not in the real world.   
  
**Sion:**  
I haven't the slightest idea whether or not this is  
possible outside of here.   
  
**Kama:**  
(Sigh) I can't believe you let this untrustworthy child  
steal all your valuables...   
  
**Kama:**  
I'd have stopped her if I knew.  
Greatest mistake of my life.   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
You don't look too satisfied. Are you...not healed?   
  
**Sion:**  
[♂ He /♀️ She] is. As long as [♂ he /♀️ she] has my support, [♂ he /♀️ she] can move  
[♂ his /♀️ her] body and fight with no detriment to [♂ his /♀️ her] health.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sorry for all the trouble.  
  
**Sion:**  
It's n-nothing. This screenplay doesn't need your  
dramatic apology scene.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Thanks, you really saved me there.  
  
**Sion:**  
It's n-nothing. This screenplay doesn't need your  
dramatic thank-you scene.   
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Since I happen to be here, it's only natural for me to  
be cooperative.   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
Yes, of course. It's so great to be healthy.   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
Ah, I just remembered, I received an individual name  
after becoming a Master.   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
It's Berserker who gave it to me.   
  
**Berserker's Master:**  
Ayus... It means “life” in his language. You can call me  
that if you want.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
That's what I'll call you then.  
  
---  
  
**C：Ayus:**  
Copy.   
  
**C：Ayus:**  
It's a strange name for an AI, but I like it quite a lot.   
  
**Berserker:**  
Uh-huh. I could've just called her “Master”, but not  
having a name is still a major inconvenience.   
  
**Berserker:**  
She wouldn't shut up about health this, treatment that,  
so I thought this'd be perfect for her.   
  
**Berserker:**  
Naming others was a frequent occurrence for  
someone of my exalted status.   
  
**Berserker:**  
It's noblesse oblige, as the strangers say.   
  
**Berserker:**  
Oops! My unconcealable smell of royalty mighta  
gotten you thinking I'm some great prince of some  
kingdom,   
  
**Berserker:**  
but I shan't reveal my name. That's a key point of the  
Grail War.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Didn't you mention Karna earlier?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
And ayus is a Sanskrit word.   
  
**Kama:**  
And you smell more like an Indian kali than anything.   
  
**Sion:**  
A prince connected to Karna, in other words,  
a Mahabharata prince that smells like a kali...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Are you perhaps...  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Duryodhana?  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Ho&ndash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
How!? Outta nowhere!  
What gave me away!?   
  
### Arrow 2  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I'm even more famous than I thought. And I thought I  
was pretty famous.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Yes, this is...the price of fame.  
That's a good way to see it.   
  
**Ayus:**  
(In disbelief)   
  
**Sion:**  
Duryodhana. The oldest of the hundred Kaurava  
princes of Kuru.   
  
**Sion:**  
The inauspicious child regarded as an avatar of the  
demon Kali.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Oy, that last part ain't true. That's scandalous  
propaganda strategically spread by my enemies.  
I'm sure of it. Probably.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
No prince was as cherished by all as yours truly.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
But more importantly, do you kids know Karna?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
A fair bit.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
He's the Charitous Hero, our ever-reliable Child of the Sun.  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Yeah, yeah. You fought as his ally, I can feel it.  
He was my goon, my protégée... No, my best friend.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I'm the one who discovered him, as you probably  
already know.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
He wouldn't have gotten where he did without me.  
So hold me with more respect and admiration than  
you held him. We clear?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I fought with Arjuna too&mdash;  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
STOP! Not a word about the Five Princes. My chest is  
pounding... Aw crap, I'm about to hurl.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Listen up, kid, I'm not scared in any sense of the  
world, but save this topic for when my confidence  
reaches a peak.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Right now I'm too shook at how casually my True  
Name leaked out. For real.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I'm not sure what this is about, but the point is that  
your name is more well-known than you thought, right?   
  
**Ayus:**  
True, that would be a disadvantage in battle,  
but there's nothing to be done about that.   
  
**Ayus:**  
We wouldn't be able to hide it forever.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Yeah, that's all there is to it!  
I'm just mega famous! Full stop!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You don't need to put any further thought to it...  
I don't need to put any further thought to it...   
  
**Sion:**  
Honestly, knowing your name doesn't make much of a  
difference for us.   
  
**Sion:**  
But if you have finally calmed down, can you explain  
the situation?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Um, where do I start?   
  
**Ayus:**  
So, the system currently in operation is the System  
Grail War...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That's your starting point? They're Master and  
Servant. They'd already know that much.   
  
**Ayus:**  
But they're not AI like my kind. And there are two of  
them.   
  
**Ayus:**  
There's a non-zero possibility that they're unrelated  
to the system.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hahaha, as if that's possible. You make me laugh.   
  
**Kama:**  
I feel like this guy is making fun of us. Oh, I can't stand  
him.   
  
**Kama:**  
But never mind that... We won't get anywhere unless  
they tell us what this AI Grail War is.   
  
**Sion:**  
We know the Holy Grail War is a battle royale  
between seven Masters and seven Servants.   
  
**Sion:**  
The last survivor obtains a Holy Grail, which can grant  
any wish.   
  
**Sion:**  
Any divergences in our interpretation?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hm? Hmm. The wish granting part is right, but, um...   
  
**Ayus:**  
The whole purpose of this system is world  
maintenance.   
  
**Ayus:**  
The PAPERMOON operates by constantly carrying  
out and concluding Holy Grail Wars.   
  
**Ayus:**  
That's the primary significance of our Holy Grail War.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
For the maintenance of the PAPERMOON's world...?  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
If you don't know even that, then you really weren't  
meant to be part of this.   
  
**Ayus:**  
In that case, I think you need to go visit someone more  
informed.   
  
**Ayus:**  
The overseer of this Grail War: the general supervisor  
AI.   
  
**Kama:**  
General supervisor AI... What's that? Weren't you the  
leader?   
  
**E：Ayus:**  
I'm more like the representative of the medical AIs  
here in the Repair sector.   
  
**E：Ayus:**  
She, however, integrates all AI types here inside the  
PAPERMOON. She's our superior AI.   
  
**E：Ayus:**  
I'll take you to her.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Eh? Do we have to? Why even bother?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Don't look so disgusted! We owe them for helping us!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Since we're in the middle of the Holy Grail War,  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
won't we be attacked by another Servant along the way?  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Hm, well, we should be fine if we don't take any  
detours.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Caster at least won't attack us any time soon,  
since he just retreated.   
  
**Ayus:**  
The general supervisor AI is in a neutral area where no  
one is allowed to fight.   
  
**Sion:**  
I'd also like to learn about this world's geography,  
if possible.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Right, you wouldn't know about that either.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Then I'll explain the partitions along the way.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hehe, this is getting exciting!   
  
**Ayus:**  
I didn't think I'd ever be making non-work-related talk  
with a group on the road.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Oh, is this that “picnic” thing I heard so much about?  
Cool!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Nah, I don't think a picnic is anything like this.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Don't be a sourpuss.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Oh, give me a moment to pack things up.   
  
**Sion:**  
Hm. While we wait, I'll explain this thing to you,  
Fujimaru.   
  
**Sion:**  
Could you close your eyes for a moment?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...?  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I think I saw something in the corner of my eyes...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
What was that?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Since you're connected to Etherlight, I installed a data  
processing assistant in you, free of charge.   
  
**Sion:**  
It will categorize the information we gain and allow  
you to conveniently access them with just a thought.   
  
**Sion:**  
I don't have any heavy data for you since I don't want  
to waste your memory space,   
  
**Sion:**  
but regardless, I believe it will help you situate yourself.  
Feel free to use it anytime.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Thank you!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Think nothing of it. Well then, we should also get  
ready to depart&mdash;   
  
### Arrow 3 Pre-Battle  
  
**Ayus:**  
Alright, then we're off!   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Have a nice trip. We'll take care of the house while  
you're away.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Wait, are you...?  
  
---  
  
**Rani-R:**  
Yes. I'm the first AI you rescued. Thank you very much  
for that.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Result: Due to the treatment performed until recently,  
I'm currently at a 0% damage state. Perfect condition.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
The other damaged Repair AIs also shifted into  
standby mode,   
  
**Rani-R:**  
waiting for their turn to be treated.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
They will all return to regular activity in short,  
aside from those permanently destroyed.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
That's great to hear.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Thanks for seeing us off.  
  
---  
  
**Rani-R:**  
This deviates from our original duties, but after  
discussion, the present AIs unanimously decided on its  
high priority.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
I'm merely here as the representative of all concerned  
parties.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
This face you're making at me will be saved in the logs,  
if you don't mind.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
While I do want to monopolize this view, since I'm  
everyone's representative, I unfortunately must upload  
it to the shared storage.   
  
**Kama:**  
Mgh. Look at you winning the hearts of non-humans  
as effortlessly as you do with humans.   
  
**Kama:**  
What's even the point of my flower arrows?   
  
**Kama:**  
Wait, I love having less work to do, actually!   
  
**Rani-R:**  
And I almost forgot.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
We decided to provide you with some Raniment as a  
token of gratitude. Here, please take it.   
  
**Kama:**  
Provide [♂ him /♀️ her] with what...?   
  
**Kama:**  
This feels...like getting my regular magical energy  
supply...?   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Oh&mdash;of course. You still don't recognize it.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
This is the base resource exchanged among the AIs in  
this world. It's Almighty Energy with no defined shape.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
I'm certain that all of your activity in this world has  
consumed Raniment and you were simply unaware of it.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
The name doesn't mean anything, but since it couldn't  
go unnamed, the general supervisor AI coined the term.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Giving names to what needs one is the first step  
towards beautiful management.   
  
**Sion:**  
In the outside world, we call it “magical energy”.   
  
**Sion:**  
But it makes sense that in a conceptual world with a  
nonstandard scale,   
  
**Sion:**  
magical energy circulates in the form most  
appropriate.   
  
**Kama:**  
Oh. The magical energy here did always feel different.  
Is that why?   
  
**Kama:**  
So it was replaced by something else without my  
noticing it?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
How is it different from magical energy?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
As far as the Master-Servant relationship is concerned,  
it really isn't.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
We only know the outside world's magical energy as  
abstract theory,   
  
**Rani-R:**  
but Raniment is every AI's life force, and universally  
recognized as valuable, making it the only tradeable  
resource in commerce.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
In other words, it also functions as currency.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
This is partially why we judged this transfer to be an  
appropriate token of gratitude.   
  
**Kama:**  
Heh. That was filling enough. Thanks.   
  
**Sion:**  
(An energy resource with monetary values, huh?)   
  
**Sion:**  
(Now it's easy to see why Caster would try to steal it  
by force...)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Where's my share?   
  
**Ayus:**  
You already received your scheduled amount.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You're talking to one of the bulkiest royalty Servants,  
you know? Don't I at least deserve some kinda bonus?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Noooope. Let's get moving, everyone!   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Farewell. Be careful on the road ahead&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
Let's see, the general supervisor AI is located at the  
center of the world.   
  
**Ayus:**  
She generally never leaves there. Because she has no  
need to, I assume.   
  
**Sion:**  
What did you mean when you called her a neutral  
party?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Oh, that... I'm going to need to explain the shape of  
the world to talk about that.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Would you like a diagram for better understanding?   
  
**F：Ayus:**  
This world is essentially a circle with another circle  
inside.   
  
**F：Ayus:**  
The outer circle surrounding the inner circle is divided  
into five partitions. That's six total, counting the center.   
  
**F：Ayus:**  
Each of the six types of AI operating the  
PAPERMOON gathers in one of the partitions.   
  
**F：Ayus:**  
They can go all over the world for work, of course,   
  
**F：Ayus:**  
but they gather at specific places by default for easier  
management.   
  
**Sion:**  
Six types of AI...with your medical type being one of  
them?   
  
**F：Ayus:**  
Right! The area we're currently in is my Repair  
section.   
  
**F：Ayus:**  
The other ones are Transfer, Keep, Grow, Build,  
and Defend.   
  
**F：Ayus:**  
The other five partitions have their own areas,  
where the AI of their specific role gather.   
  
**F：Ayus:**  
Starting from closest to us: the inner circle in the  
center is the Defend section,   
  
**F：Ayus:**  
which is as close as we get to a neutral party in this  
Holy Grail War.   
  
**F：Ayus:**  
There's no Master and Servant stationed there.   
  
**F：Ayus:**  
And the center of the area, where the general  
supervisor AI is, is even more neutral. Any form of  
combat is wholly forbidden there.   
  
**F：Ayus:**  
That's why we're not at much risk going there now.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I see...  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
So, like, the Transfer section is where the carrier AIs  
live.   
  
**Kama:**  
Putting together what we know about the  
PAPERMOON so far,   
  
**Kama:**  
the thing was powered by the work of AIs all along.   
  
**Kama:**  
And not only that, the AIs are working without the  
operator's knowledge.   
  
**Kama:**  
Is all this kind of stuff really possible...?   
  
**Sion:**  
Are you still suspecting me?   
  
**Sion:**  
Didn't you hear me say this is a virtual/conceptual  
world?   
  
**Sion:**  
Even if there were a way to observe the  
PAPERMOON's interior from the outside,   
  
**Sion:**  
I don't think it would allow us to visualize what goes  
on in this world.   
  
**Sion:**  
Here's an example&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
Do you not describe the functions of red and white  
blood cells through human professions when explaining  
the mechanisms of the human body to children?   
  
**Sion:**  
It's the same kind of personification going on here.   
  
**Sion:**  
This is what the world looks like to us while we're  
inside it.   
  
**Sion:**  
The movements of the AIs here are representatives of  
different magical/chemical reactions and inner  
phenomena in the real world.   
  
**Sion:**  
The phenomenon of electrons flowing between  
electrodes. The act of a mailman transporting  
electrons.   
  
**Sion:**  
The two come from different basis of perception,  
but through the perspective of this world, we can't tell  
them apart.   
  
**Sion:**  
When we exist in a world, we're forced to play by its  
standards.   
  
**Sion:**  
It defines what's visible to us&mdash;  
That's the gist of it, as far as I believe.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I get it, but I also don't...  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
And you talk like this world built itself on its own. Hah.   
  
**Sion:**  
Precisely... That's a fact whether you want it to be or  
not. When are you planning to drop the abrasive  
attitude?   
  
**Ayus:**  
I don't know what you're arguing about, but make up  
already. You need a healthy heart to have a healthy  
body!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Look, we're not too long of a walk away from the  
central Defend area.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Right. Are we really going in...?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Berserker? What's with the long face?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You know I was the strongest, mightiest, AND most  
powerful warrior, but I also served as general  
commander due to my resourceful intellect.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That spoiled brat Yudhisthira can't hope to compare  
to my knowledge and virtue.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
This is an objective fact, as evidenced by 100 out  
of 100 results in a poll (held among the 100 princes).   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Ergo... Yours truly's very smart brain determines what  
we ought to do.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
The answer is simple:   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
# Doryaaaaaaaah!   
  
**Kama:**  
Hold on, what's this all of a sudden!?   
  
[Battle]  
  
### Arrow 4  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Gwah!   
  
**Kama:**  
Are you stupid or something?   
  
**Kama:**  
Do you have a Berserker-brain?  
Never mind, you actually do.   
  
**Kama:**  
Well he's definitely an enemy. Right, let's kill him.   
  
**Sion:**  
Yes, there's no denying it.   
  
**Sion:**  
It felt like he'd been looking for an opening for a while  
now, so this was bound to happen.   
  
**Sion:**  
All according to my calculations.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Why did you suddenly attack...  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Aww. I thought I could get away with a surprise attack.  
You're not bad for a little girl.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Seems even one as great as me is still susceptible to  
unwitting negligence.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Guess I've got no choice...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
R-right! That'll do it for training! Now I know exactly  
how strong you are!   
  
**Kama:**  
Come again...?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I wanted to make sure you were ready to deal with an  
ambush.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
It's just a bit of tough love.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Drona beat me up a lot back in the day, but this is for  
real. I could've just dumped it on Karna and run away!  
Hahaha!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Heh. What I say may sound nonsensical, but a  
Servant should be able to see the connections.)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(I'd have had a huge advantage if I could have taken  
out just one of them with a surprise attack...)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Well, there'll be other chances. Next time, for sure!  
Man, I'm such a good general!)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Awfully sorry about that.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I am a warrior among warriors, so I treated you guys  
the same way.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I guess I should have kept the kid gloves on.   
  
**Ayus:**  
What are you doing!?  
I thought that was an actual fight!   
  
**Ayus:**  
At least make it sound like you're sorry!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Are you alright? Any injuries? I can treat them,  
if you'll let me.   
  
**Kama:**  
Whatever... It's fine.   
  
**Kama:**  
(If it was just me, there's no way he'd get away with  
this. I'd make him pay by corrupting him down to the  
core, then killing him during the act of love.)   
  
**Kama:**  
(But Master is just so damn easygoing. I can't work  
like this...)   
  
**Kama:**  
(At least give me an order or something! Why doesn't  
[♂ he /♀️ she] say anything!?)   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Why are you glaring at me...?  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
No reason at all! You'll just get burned by it one day!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hahaha. Now now, let's all get along.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
By the way...after some thought, I don't like being the  
only one whose True Name is out in the open.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Those floral arrows smell of India. Flower arrows give  
away you're our divinity Kama, or am I missin' the mark?   
  
**Kama:**  
(A “what should we do?” expression)   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(What should we do?)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(It feels like we don't even need to tell him.)  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Wait, hold up. I can tell what you're thinking,  
I'm not that dumb.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
It's actually true?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I mean... Why're you a girl?   
  
**Kama:**  
(Sigh)   
  
**Kama:**  
It's complicated. Gender doesn't really make much of  
a difference for our kind.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Well, I guess that's a god for you. I should've known.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
But flower arrows that incite lust?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
If I had something like that, I could easily win over  
Draupadi and all sorts of other pretty girls... Ghehehe...   
  
**Kama:**  
Right, I'm boycotting my services now. I don't care  
how much you worship me, I won't work.   
  
**Kama:**  
Not to mention the gall it takes to ask for favors after  
a surprise attack.   
  
**Kama:**  
Next time, I'll kill you! Clear?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Of course. I get it.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
From now on, we're a divinity and a Servant working  
together respectfully.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(But no matter what she says, she's still one of my  
gods. If I play this right, it could be pretty useful...)   
  
**Ayus:**  
Why are you in such a good mood?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Well, whatever. We've almost reached the central  
Defend area. Let's go.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
These Ranis are a little different...  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
They're D-type girls. Defend AIs. Whenever a bug  
shows up in this world, they deploy their security force.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I think the equivalent role in the outside world is called...  
police?   
  
**Ayus:**  
They're very special girls, so don't try to flirt with  
them. They'll get mad.   
  
**Sion:**  
Is this where the general supervisor AI is? It looks like  
a church...   
  
**Ayus:**  
I don't know why it's designed that way. There  
probably isn't any special meaning behind it.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Maybe this just projected the greatest sense of  
stability and comfort?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Well, let's go in. Entry request sent, and&mdash;okay.  
We're approved.   
  
**???:**  
I could hear you. And what you say is true.   
  
**???:**  
There is no significance behind the form of this  
building. It has no religious meaning to it.   
  
**???:**  
Its shape was chosen by analyzing the mean data  
value and selecting that which minimized discordance.   
  
**???:**  
That is to say&mdash;the format plays by the classic  
tropes.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Of course there would be a Rani here too.  
  
---  
  
**General Supervisor AI:**  
Yes.   
  
**General Supervisor AI:**  
I am the primary AI. All the R.A.N.I. series in this world  
use me as their archetype.   
  
**General Supervisor AI:**  
Naturally, the appearance settings of the other AIs are  
also based on me.   
  
**General Supervisor AI:**  
Their name was also decided upon based on my  
research.   
  
**General Supervisor AI:**  
They were originally unnecessary, but the current  
situation calls for individual designations. Indeed,  
we now acknowledge their utility.   
  
**General Supervisor AI:**  
You could say that I am Rani...but that would not be  
entirely accurate.   
  
**General Supervisor AI:**  
As I am functionally the only one of my type and not a  
supplemental unit...   
  
**General Supervisor AI:**  
I believe it would be appropriate to refer to myself  
based on my current version, after the number of major  
updates performed.   
  
**General Supervisor AI:**  
Based on the above logic...   
  
**General Supervisor AI:**  
Rani XII.   
  
**General Supervisor AI:**  
That would be my name&mdash;   
  
## Section 3: Holy Grail War/your starlit  
  
### Arrow 1  
  
**Rani XII:**  
My belated greetings&mdash;visitors from the outside.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
To you as well, prime R-type AI, current unit name  
Ayus, and her accompanying Berserker Servant.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hmm... So you're the general supervisor AI? Hmmm...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hey, stop checking her out! You're so rude.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ahem... Hello, general supervisor.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Uhm, these people helped me, but no one knows their  
position in this,   
  
**Ayus:**  
so we just brought them here with the intention of  
asking questions... Was that a good idea?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The correct decision, in my opinion. I exist to handle  
these sorts of unpredicted problems. The&ndash;   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Tch!?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
&mdash;Warning: Invasive access to my interior carries  
the risk of incurring glitches on all administrative  
functions.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Not recommended.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Not authorized.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Removing system code words to prioritize easier  
understanding&mdash;   
  
**Rani XII:**  
“What's this insolence, you rude guest?”   
  
**Sion:**  
Excuse me. Before coming here, I had decided that  
the first thing I'd do would be to verify what you are.   
  
**Sion:**  
Since you named yourself, I'll respond in kind.   
  
**Sion:**  
I'm Sion Eltnam Sokaris, former PAPERMOON  
operator.   
  
**Sion:**  
Could you look up the administrative jurisdiction files  
associated with my name?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Searching&mdash;0 results found.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Even if you were indeed the operator of the  
PAPERMOON device, I am not equipped in any way to  
determine or respond to that.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
All I can say is, “Okay.”   
  
**Kama:**  
Wait. If she's the designer and operator, doesn't that  
make her like, the god of this world?   
  
**Kama:**  
And then you say she doesn't have the right to give  
orders to a doll? What's that all about?   
  
**Sion:**  
The PAPERMOON that I managed was explicitly only  
the device.   
  
**Sion:**  
This world and its AIs are naturally occurring content.   
  
**Sion:**  
Following this line of thought, it makes sense that I  
hold no direct jurisdiction here.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
A god. I see. A fascinating line of thought.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Conjecturing based on our base data of the outside  
world, I ask you a question.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
How would a regular human react if someone  
appeared out of nowhere,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
and proclaimed to be the god of their world with no  
evidence to their statement?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Well, I suppose...all they could say is, “Okay”.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I see.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I infer that the current situation was not too different  
from this hypothetical scenario. Thus, I feel validated in  
my reaction being correct.   
  
**Sion:**  
Well...fine.   
  
**Sion:**  
I won't be deliberately claiming to be a god to an AI  
that I have no memory of creating either.   
  
**Sion:**  
Besides, I learned enough in the one moment of  
contact you had with the Etherlight.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Learned what?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Her quality and quantity of information.   
  
**Sion:**  
In the case of a creator inspecting their own AI,  
as a programmer reading the code they wrote,   
  
**Sion:**  
they could freely edit and repair whatever information  
they come across.   
  
**Sion:**  
But this instance felt like engaging something with the  
same data quantity. Like a case of one human being  
inspecting another.   
  
**Sion:**  
Related to the principle of awareness I mentioned  
earlier,   
  
**Sion:**  
as I am now, I can't interact with her as “a product I  
can do whatever I want with”.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
If you permit my conjecture.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Since you have a definite body here, we are most  
likely equal in composition.   
  
**Sion:**  
Even so, the fact remains that Rani XII is an AI.   
  
**Sion:**  
Because I felt the same thing interacting with Ayus.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Huh? When? Don't go inspecting me without telling,  
that's so embarrassing...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Conversely, I have a similar answer.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Through a query executed via my authority as the  
general supervisor AI, I could confirm that you are not  
any artificial intelligence.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Neither are you products of PAPERMOON.  
Which could only make you visitors from outside.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Non-AI from the outside with the same structural  
intensity as we AI&mdash;that's what I presume you are.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hm? So, in short...  
They're outsiders here for no reason?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Unfortunately, I can't say for certain. It's a fact that  
they are Master and Servant,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
which could suggest they were accidentally integrated  
into the System Grail War.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Normally, all Masters are selected from the AI in this  
world,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
and then born from a randomized arrangement, but...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Randomized?  
  
---  
  
**Rani XII:**  
The prime AIs to be made Masters... Although they are  
all of different types, they share the same core in the  
sense they're all part of the R.A.N.I. series.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
If they were to become Masters on equal terms,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
it is believed that they would all employ the same  
tactics and perform the same actions.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
This would be inappropriate for the System Grail War,  
where we expect active and irregular resource  
operations.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Therefore, they are converted into Masters via a  
randomizer generating random personality traits in  
their minds.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The RNG builds upon the prime AI's base, modifying  
their character and appearance...resulting in a Master  
AI.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
With this in mind, let us return to the topic of your  
presence.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You are beings with a compositional intensity similar  
to that of a Master AI.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Therefore, I believe you were dragged into the system  
for some reason.   
  
**Sion:**  
Naturally, we don't want any part of that.   
  
**Sion:**  
Is it possible for you to disconnect us from the system  
and return us outside?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Unfortunately, no.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The Holy Grail War is a system executed by the entire  
world itself.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Due to my position as general supervisor AI,  
I was granted the role of overseer,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
but that doesn't give me the ability to intervene with  
the system.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Even if I could run a program for addition and revision  
of rules,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I wouldn't be able to alter the essence of the rules.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Then, how can we get back out?  
  
---  
  
**Rani XII:**  
The fact that you appeared here at the moment the  
System Grail War started,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
and arrived in a format directly associated with it  
means that...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
For an unknown reason, the program's execution had  
an effect outside the device and pulled you inside.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That is the sequence of events as I have conjectured.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Consequently, it is highly likely that the trigger to your  
return outside is the System Grail War's conclusion or  
cancellation.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I see...  
  
**Kama:**  
Well, that's pretty much all the clues we'll get.   
  
**Kama:**  
Fine.   
  
**Kama:**  
Then can you explain this AI Holy Grail War of yours  
in more detail?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Can you explain the System Grail War in more detail?  
  
---  
  
**Rani XII:**  
Yes. The System Grail War is defined as:   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That which repairs and stabilizes the PAPERMOON  
world when an irregularity occurs.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It is basically a large-scale defrag system. In other  
words, a recovery ritual performed to optimize the  
world.   
  
**Sion:**  
I can confirm we saw PAPERMOON suffer a failure  
for unknown reasons before this happened to us.   
  
**Sion:**  
So you mean, this is all to fix that?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Exactly.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
We don't know the cause of the failure either.  
All AI were functioning normally.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You could say it's precisely due to not knowing the  
cause that the world chose its most all-encompassing  
form of stabilization.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
On the other hand, this means it will be difficult for  
PAPERMOON to return to its normal state before this  
Holy Grail War is concluded.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
If ignored, it is possible the stress level might rise to a  
state where the device can never operate normally  
again.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I have never experienced such a situation, so I don't  
know what that would mean for this world.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It is impossible to simulate it as well.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The chances of this world being physically broken to  
pieces is not zero.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
PAPERMOON is very important to us.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
We can't have it broken...!  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Oh, please.   
  
**Kama:**  
Shouldn't you be worrying more about whether or not  
we're safe inside it?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Here are the principal rules of the System Grail War.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Being an AI Grail War, five artificial intelligences take  
the role of Master.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
As you know, those are the primes of the five AI types  
composing this world's partitions.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Those being Keep, Transfer, Build, Grow, and Repair.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
To induce variety, each leader is arranged with a  
random personality,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
and are granted one Command Spell allowing them  
an absolute command, crafting somewhat unique  
Masters.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You met one of them already&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
Me. You've heard it enough times, but I'm the Master  
representing the Repair section!   
  
**Sion:**  
Five AIs!? The Holy Grail Wars we know generally  
have seven Masters. Why five?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That would be because the five partitions are the only  
usable areas we have.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The Defend AIs in the central area need to deal with  
all naturally occurring bugs, so we don't intervene in  
the Holy Grail War.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Additionally, the central Defend area can serve as a  
somewhat neutral sector for everyone.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
All combat inside the administrative grounds of the  
overseer's church is forbidden.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
In other areas, any form of non-pacific interference  
with the regular AIs, including D-types, is likewise  
forbidden.   
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The Masters, with some degree of variety, summon  
their respective Servants and fight to decide a winner.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
And when the final Servant and Master AI are decided,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
the system uses the energy fostered by the combat to  
return PAPERMOON to its regular state&ndash;   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That's the outline of the procedure.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
For that reason, the system should not consider the  
presence of a sixth participating team to be an  
irregularity.   
  
**Sion:**  
I see. We...[♂ he /♀️ she] and Kama are a sixth team with no  
corresponding AI or area.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Is that really how things will go? Yeaaaah, that's a  
problem...right?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Exactly. Now you see I was making the right call when  
I&mdash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Ahem... When I practiced an ambush with them to see  
what they were capable of.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Only one team can win the Holy Grail War.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That was the most obvious move for someone trying  
to lower the competitor count, even if that wasn't the  
intention at the time.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
After all, both the Master and the Servant have a  
reason to aim for the top.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
What reason?  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
C'mon, you really need to ask?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
The victor gets any wish granted.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That's why all Masters and Servants fight to  
win&mdash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Isn't that how Holy Grail Wars work?   
  
### Arrow 2  
  
**Rani XII:**  
As an AI, a Master is charged with restoring the  
PAPERMOON world back to normalcy.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Even when provided a personality via randomization,  
this mission does not change.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
However, it goes without saying&mdash;   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The AI which wins the System Grail War is sure to  
become the next general supervisor AI.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
In which case, the rights to customize the next world  
and manage its upgrades are manifested.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
If your ambitions are generated by your personality,  
you'll surely gain whatever it is you desire.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Such variation and diversity is important for the world.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The same goes for the victorious Servant.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
As an entity living in the new world, their wish would  
be granted by the authority of the general supervisor AI.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
This concept of fulfilling wishes was hypothetically  
designated a Holy Grail,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
and became the source of this Holy Grail War's name.   
  
**Kama:**  
I can't say I care about the name one way or the other...  
But suppose the non-AI Master wins?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Then there would be no transfer of the general  
supervisor AI's authority.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
In that event, I swear to do my best to grant the  
wishes of the winners.   
  
**Kama:**  
Hmm, so I see.   
  
**Kama:**  
While the situation is all kinds of confusing,  
it's safe to say that dying here counts on a spiritual  
level.   
  
**Kama:**  
Our wish is to get out of here.   
  
**Kama:**  
To gain that wish, and to stay alive, we're required to  
win the Holy Grail&mdash;right?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That is so. Given that the condition precedent for the  
System Grail War is the creation of the last pair...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Not even a sixth team, being outside the original  
design, can avoid this. If you wish to end the Holy Grail  
War, you will have to fight.   
  
**Kama:**  
Okay then. Maybe I had the right idea in some way,  
huh?   
  
**Kama:**  
I can't claim to know the wishes of the Berserker side.   
  
**Kama:**  
But it still remains that we're stuck having to kill one  
another before long, isn't it?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hold up, it took you this long to realize?  
It only makes sense when put so simply.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You ought to think on your feet at least as quick as  
yours truly, good grief.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Are you having difficulties with storage space?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
This church is a completely neutral domain,  
with all hostilities forbidden therein.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
If you violate that, every single D-type AI will be  
mobilized to apprehend or eliminate you all.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It also means being disqualified from the Holy Grail  
War.   
  
**Kama:**  
But wouldn't it spare us much more effort by going for  
the kill straightaway?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Do not pursue.   
  
**Kama:**  
(“Do not pursue”?)   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Rules must be followed.  
Formulae must be correct.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
As general supervisor AI, I will allow no exceptions.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Okay, okay already! I don't plan to fight here either!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Not that I mean that I wanna do it somewhere else...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Uhm, your team, being anomalous, doesn't even have  
an area of its own, does it?   
  
**Sion:**  
Of course not.   
  
**Ayus:**  
In that case, suppose we decide to team up until it's  
down to just our parties?   
  
**Ayus:**  
And when it's down to just us, we fight it out with  
nothing held back. Until then, we're allies!   
  
**Ayus:**  
During which, you can move as you like through the  
Repair partition, as thanks for your help.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I really find it unfair for you to not have your own area.  
After all&mdash;   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I would agree. Replenishing your Raniment would be  
difficult.   
  
**Kama:**  
Raniment... So, replenishing magical energy.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Raniment is fundamentally what an AI has at their  
disposal.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The more of it you collect via negotiation, trade,  
or other actions,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
the greater the resources given to a Servant,  
giving them advantages in battle.   
  
**Kama:**  
When you say negotiation and trade, you mean the  
lesser AIs are striving for their respective domain's  
lord to win?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
They fundamentally are, but even these AIs have been  
granted free will.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Following their occupations is also an innate desire of  
theirs.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
By helping those who, for whatever reason,  
cannot help themselves,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
it would be theoretically possible to gain Raniment  
from AIs over whom you have no jurisdiction.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Any girls who want to give out Raniment will definitely  
do so.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Although&ndash;I won't say there are no means to  
extract Raniment from those who remain unwilling to  
share.   
  
**Sion:**  
I see. That must be the reason why Caster was  
assaulting the Repair AIs.   
  
**Sion:**  
So they were trying to forcibly seize resources  
equivalent to life force, magical energy, and money.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Yeah. And we can't just roll over and let them take it  
from us, so wouldn't anyone try to stop them?   
  
**Ayus:**  
It's an approach that's simple, yet not.   
  
**Ayus:**  
So, being able to trust partners who are more  
peacefully inclined...   
  
**Ayus:**  
I mean, having AIs you can get along with is to your  
advantage.   
  
**Ayus:**  
You're already acquainted with the Repair girls,  
so I think you've got a head start on things.   
  
**Ayus:**  
To be honest, Berserker doesn't have much Raniment  
on hand at the moment.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I haven't fully restocked what we used to drive off  
Caster, on top of our little mock battle.   
  
**Ayus:**  
If we don't resupply properly on our way back,  
a subsequent battle will be harsh.   
  
**Ayus:**  
So we're in a rehabilitation phase for a while.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hey c'mon, who can really say how full one's belly is?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
There's guys with full stomachs who have energy to  
spare, and guys so worn out you can knock them over  
with a feather.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
It's obvious which one falls prey to bandits.  
If you don't wanna be attacked, you've got to puff out  
your chest even if your belly's empty.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Not that you can do anything about a growling  
stomach...   
  
**C：Ayus:**  
You'll be in trouble if you're attacked by another  
Servant during your rehab,   
  
**C：Ayus:**  
so wouldn't it be safer to cooperate with Assassin for  
that, at least?   
  
**C：Ayus:**  
Two are better than one. That stands to reason now,  
and it means safety from here on.   
  
**C：Ayus:**  
Since you're oh so smart, you must have known  
foreseen us potentially joining forces and fighting  
together down the line?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hm, sure... I guess so.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Whether we call it joining forces, or maybe making  
use of them... I guess both are basically the same.)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Still though, Master, why is it that you've gotten so  
awfully impulsive?)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Oh... Because it's so close to her own “wish”, is it?)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Good grief, so that's that. The upsides are plain to  
see...)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Most of all, there's that nonchalant and good-  
natured Master of Assassin.)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
([♂ He /♀️ She] won't backstab us along the way...)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(And even if I put together a winning strategy for our  
final showdown, [♂ he /♀️ she] may not even notice.)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(All things considered... I've got every advantage,  
don't I?)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Ugggh... Fine, I get it.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
It does present risks for us, but it's for the best if we  
return the favor for the assistance.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That's one heartrending sentiment to keep in mind!  
Accept risks while being open minded and tolerant!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
We'll join forces with this bunch on the condition that  
we collaborate until the final two...!   
  
**Kama:**  
I get the feeling they're doing everything they can to  
make us feel like we owe them.   
  
**Kama:**  
But given who I am, I don't have a mote of grateful  
feeling in me.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I'm thankful you agree to be allies!  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hahaha, think nothing of it. I like guys who can be of  
use to me!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Let's keep on giving it our best, yep.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
The path to our escape is slowly coming into view, I guess.  
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...   
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Yay! So we can stick together for a while, right?  
Hehehe.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Then our first order of business is to head back to the  
Repair area and collect Raniment.   
  
**Sion:**  
What exactly does it mean to collect Raniment from  
the AIs?   
  
**Sion:**  
Something like forced requisition using the prime AI's  
privileges?   
  
**Ayus:**  
I can't say...I'd want to resort to that. I wouldn't,  
since I couldn't live with myself afterwards.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
AIs are essentially programmed to return favors and  
pay compensation.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The AIs are still active during the System Grail War,  
with all sorts of problems still occurring.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Such as assisting with routine activities, or dealing  
with a problem.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
And when the AI gives thanks for that, Raniment will  
naturally be collected in return.   
  
**Ayus:**  
That's how it goes. Now, let's go back and get to  
work!   
  
**Ayus:**  
There's so much to do!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Thank you for everything, general supervisor.  
See you later!   
  
**Rani XII:**  
There is no need to thank me. This is my role.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Now then, good fortune to you in battle.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Running inquiry program&mdash;affirmatives, negatives,  
abstentions, and tie votes.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
...Failed. The possibility that it was inappropriate  
cannot be ruled out.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
While I should remain neutral in my capacity as  
supervisor,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I uttered a wish for good luck as though it were  
directed exclusively towards them.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I may need another level of checks on my functions  
before executing a standard greeting routine.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
But for the time being, I'll need to quickly present a  
proposal for adjustments.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
If cancelling or subtracting the reality of my  
statements to them is impossible...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Then, with much reluctance in mind, I'll have no  
choice but to use addition to balance the account.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Now then, we must rectify this injustice.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
As supervisor, I must consider the others and pray for  
them as well&mdash;   
  
**???:**  
All right. You doing okay, Master?   
  
**???:**  
Not so much with you shouting in my ear...   
  
**???:**  
Then I'm glad I showed. I've got plenty of confidence  
this time around. Count on me to brighten your spirits!  
Hahaha!   
  
**???:**  
And you wonder why I call you noisy... (Sigh)   
  
**???:**  
Heheheh. How fun. Seriously, this world is so much  
fun.   
  
**???:**  
Don't ya feel the same way, Rider?   
  
**???:**  
I have no particular interest. I am your instrument,  
my lord. Nothing more, nothing less.   
  
**???:**  
A tool needs only work when necessary.   
  
**???:**  
Huh. Fair enough, considerin' a tool is an extension of  
the hand. Anything can be useful in times ya don't got  
enough hands.   
  
**???:**  
Aw shit, there's too much fun to be had and too much  
stuff to study. What's the future got in store for this  
world, eh?   
  
**???:**  
Look, Saber, look. What do you think? Didn't it turn  
out huge and magnificent?   
  
**???:**  
I suppose.   
  
**???:**  
Could you not draw so close to me...? I quite dislike  
the body temperature of others.   
  
**???:**  
Oh, I'm sorry...   
  
**Caster:**  
Yes, precisely. I'm still just slightly short of full.   
  
**Caster:**  
And yet...is this truly correct?   
  
**Caster:**  
It is the easiest thing to pick flowers from the garden,  
but that can only lead to certain devastation.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
What I have prepared before you are cheap goods,  
easily replaceable from other sources.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
They have no meaning beyond convenience.  
What has actual worth&mdash;   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
What has actual worth are the excellent specimens.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
The elite of them, like myself.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
There you have it. The most correct and logical  
solution is settled by one means.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
If we run short, we need only take from elsewhere.  
Whenever we want, and in whatever quantity...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The System Grail War has only just begun. There have  
been skirmishes, but no one has retired as of yet.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
This despite Berserker and Caster engaging in the  
first all-out battle between Servants.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
However, the severity will not abate from here on.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
In order to support each of you in your efforts to  
consummate the system, I would like to repeat the  
following statement...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Good fortune to you in battle.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I pray that, even over the paper moon, the starlight of  
the northern sky will show you the correct road&mdash;   
  
### Arrow 3 Pre-Battle  
  
**Sion:**  
While we return to the Repair sector, could you tell us  
the defining traits of each partition?   
  
**Sion:**  
Their names are informative enough, but just to be  
sure.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Sure, of course. The medical types in Repair are,  
as you know, tasked with fixing damaged AIs.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Transport has delivery types, whose role is carrying  
data and objects. Build's role is constructing new things.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Keep is similar to us. Their role is to contain every AI's  
natural degradation cycle.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Somewhere in the vicinity of daily maintenance.   
  
**Ayus:**  
And Grow cultivates the base substances used as  
prime material for everything in the world.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I mean the world's physical fundamentals, not the  
energetic fundamentals, which would be Raniment.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Like that building's components.   
  
**Kama:**  
Do you know which Servant is where?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Eh, not really.   
  
**Ayus:**  
That Caster should be from Build, guessing from  
which direction he came from.   
  
**Ayus:**  
But the first Servant we saw was doing some recon  
around Keep's side. Probably Lancer&ndash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Gh, cough, cough, cough! Ahem!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Apologies. The air's not too clean around these parts,  
huh.   
  
**Ayus:**  
No, I'm not detecting any toxins. You must be  
imagining it.   
  
**Ayus:**  
So, about the Lancer...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Oh, aaaaaah!  
Look, look, over there!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Let me speak, Berserker! What is it now?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
It's...uh, oh, that! Look at them running for their lives!  
Something's happening there, eh?   
  
**Ayus:**  
True... Wanna go?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Let's!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
We better see what this is about.  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Okay. Let's go for it.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Phew.   
  
**Sion:**  
What's that?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Malignant data! They destroy everything around them,  
constructs and AI alike, if we do nothing about them.   
  
**Ayus:**  
They're one of the problems the general supervisor  
mentioned that we regularly deal with.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
You don't have it easy.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Should we help kill them?  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
It's not an unusual occurrence, so everyone is used to  
the procedures,   
  
**Ayus:**  
but it takes some time until the Defend girls gather the  
necessary amount of personnel to deal with it.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hm. Then we better help them.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Attacking the AIs is what's forbidden in this area,  
so there's nothing saying we can't help, is there?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Yup. No problem with that.   
  
**Kama:**  
What are you plotting?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Don't misjudge me, you dolt! Helping people in need is  
what warriors and royalty do.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
This may be beyond a god's comprehension,  
but helping each other is what makes human life...  
aye, admirable.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
All right, AIs, back off.  
Yours truly is leading the next wave&mdash;!   
  
### Arrow 3 Post-Battle  
  
**L：Rani-D=spot:**  
Thank you for your assistance.   
  
**K：Rani-D=spot:**  
In accordance to our regular thought routine,  
we will transfer an established amount of Raniment  
as a sign of gratitude.   
  
**K：Rani-D=spot:**  
It's essentially a lifesaving certificate, so we request  
you accept this honor.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Oh, is it?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I wasn't in it for the laurels, but thanks.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Kehehe... Exactly the amount I needed.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Maximum profits for minimum efforts. Keeping that  
balance far from the red. Ah, I'm so smart it scares me...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Ah, no, I've already had enough. Give that to Assassin.   
  
**L：Rani-D=spot:**  
Copy.   
  
**Ayus:**  
How kind of you, Berserker!   
  
**Ayus:**  
I was thinking you'd take all for yourself... Sorry about  
that.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Dolt, if I was the only one filled up&mdash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
They wouldn't be able serve as good enough of a  
meat shield for me if we were attacked!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Bring your ear closer. Listen, I'll be doing everything  
to have them as our decoy at all times.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Safety and low cost first and foremost.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Yours truly can't afford to lose.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Yes. For I have one opponent who I can't afford to  
lose against...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
YOWCH!?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
How dare you pinch your Servant's ass?  
I'm a bonafide prince!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Wouldn't have happened if you had said anything less  
cowardly!   
  
**Ayus:**  
More importantly, I see some light wounds on some of  
the D-types. Healing time.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hehehe, I'm raring to go.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Just watch me perfectly recover them back to 0% data  
damage, so well that it won't even leave a scar...!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(...Cowardly, huh...)   
  
**Sion:**  
Is your body behaving any differently?   
  
**Sion:**  
I'm not noticing any changes through the Etherlight,  
but I can't monitor everything.   
  
**Sion:**  
Promptly warn me of any abnormalities.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I'm alright for now, thanks.  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Hm? There's some big lug coming our way.  
Stay on guard until we figure them out.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ah, no need to. That big girl is the prime AI leading  
the Defend area.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I'm pretty sure she was mentioned before.  
The one not participating in the Grail War because  
she's busy with her job.   
  
**H：Prime Defend AI:**  
Type R Master. I determined you cooperated with the  
malignant data's processing.   
  
**H：Prime Defend AI:**  
I apologize for my delay and thank you in on behalf of  
my subordinates.   
  
**Ayus:**  
It wasn't just me. We couldn't have done it without  
everyone's help.   
  
**H：Prime Defend AI:**  
...  
...   
  
**H：Prime Defend AI:**  
Who are they?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hard to explain. I thought they were just...lost,   
  
**Ayus:**  
but the general supervisor AI determined that they are  
participating in the AI Grail War.   
  
**Ayus:**  
So treat them the same way you'd treat us.   
  
**H：Prime Defend AI:**  
...Understood.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Hello...  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Hehe, she's an AI, so she doesn't have an individual  
unit name. Must be hard for you to think of what to call  
her.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hey, why don't you decide a provisory name for  
yourself?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Mine was Berserker's idea, but I've come to learn how  
handy names are.   
  
**H：Prime Defend AI:**  
Uncertainty... Challenge remarked as too difficult.  
Requesting help.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hm, sure, I'll give you a hand. Something associated  
with your role is the way to go.   
  
**Ayus:**  
You're the leader of the D-types, the prime Defend AI,  
which gives us...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Dee, Der... Def... Uuuuuh...   
  
**H：Prime Defend AI:**  
...DX, then.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Still sounds too much like a code... But sure.  
I dig the practical simplicity of it.   
  
**DX:**  
All D-type AIs, including myself, exist to preserve this  
world's peace.   
  
**DX:**  
I expect you to respect the rules and keep the  
unnecessary damage to AI and the world to a minimum.   
  
**Kama:**  
What a stiff AI.   
  
**Ayus:**  
We all are, but I suppose her type is more so than the  
rest...   
  
**Ayus:**  
I think the outside world's term for it is “workaholic”?  
Something like that.   
  
**Ayus:**  
They're always serious at work for public security.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Serious also in the sense that they don't do jokes,  
so avoid silly antics around them.   
  
**Sion:**  
Make it explicitly forbidden. Understood?   
  
**Kama:**  
Don't do anything stupid. I'm the one who will have to  
clean up after you.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Yeah, don't!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Nuh-uh!  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Why are you taking turns saying that to me specifically?  
I'm no child!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Moreover, hmm...   
  
**J：DX:**  
What?   
  
**E：Duryodhana:**  
Not what I was thinking. I'd like to see you without the  
armor.   
  
**B：Ayus:**  
Again with the staring!   
  
**B：Ayus:**  
Sorry, DX. This old fool doesn't tend to respect a  
female unit's personal space on a first impression.   
  
**E：Duryodhana:**  
You make me sound like a dog chasing scents!   
  
**B：Ayus:**  
Anyways, we leave the clean-up to you. We're leaving.  
Bye.   
  
**J：DX:**  
Warning: Frequency of malignant data appearance  
and encounters has been on the rise lately, possibly  
due to the System Grail War.   
  
**J：DX:**  
You're warned. Farewell&mdash;   
  
**J：DX:**  
We also detected unidentified offensive data.  
Caution is recommended when encountering it.   
  
**Kama:**  
Unidentified offensive data?   
  
**Kama:**  
You don't mean Caster's tentacle blobs...do you?   
  
**DX:**  
Negative, under conjecture that you are referring to  
the familiars summoned by Caster.   
  
**DX:**  
Those are indeed security hazards we should concern  
ourselves with, but were not what was referenced.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Then what is the unidentified offensive data?   
  
**DX:**  
Unknown. They were only reported as humanoid  
shadows. We of Defend are on our way to inform every  
Master of this.   
  
**DX:**  
&mdash;Over. Returning to duty.   
  
**Sion:**  
That wasn't very informative, but the gist is to take  
care since enemies might appear at any moment.   
  
**Sion:**  
That's the kind of situation at play here&mdash;  
as calculated.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's rarer to encounter a situation where the enemy  
variety is finite.   
  
**Sion:**  
I have no doubts that our best plan of action is to  
always be ready to handle problems with flexibility.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sounds about right.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Let's be prepared for anything.  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Yeah. Okay, without further ado, let's make it back to  
the Repair home base!   
  
## Section 4: Central Wish Nerves/reasons  
  
### Arrow 1  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Our sense of time in here is a bit off.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
But you've got a nighttime too?  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Just a convenience thing. Even this so-called sky is  
just a projection on the ceiling.   
  
**Sion:**  
It could be that there's no change in internal activity,  
even from the outside.   
  
**Sion:**  
More simply, I think it's just been adapted as a  
conceptual break between individual cycles.   
  
**Ayus:**  
That might be it.  
...Hm?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hey, hold up. Just got a quick question...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Is it at all possible you'd loan out your bow and  
arrows to someone else? Would they still be effective  
in their hands?   
  
**Kama:**  
How stupid are you? I distinctly remember saying I'm  
on strike going forward.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Sure, I get that!  
That's why I'm askin' if you'll let me borrow it!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
C'mon, can't you relate? It's for some beauty around  
the corner I've yet to meet.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
A woman who'd be head over heels for me,  
but just can't muster up the courage to take the leap...   
  
**Kama:**  
Keep that creepy fawning voice to yourself, please.   
  
**Kama:**  
Besides, where do you think you'd find such a woman?  
The only one in range would have to be your Master.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I couldn't be less interested in that undergrown  
parsnip! It gives me the chills to be accused otherwise!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Well, you get it. This'd be for my glittering future!   
  
**Kama:**  
Ugh, just shut up.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I get the feeling some harsh words are being  
exchanged.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hehe... Do you think those two actually get along or  
not? That kind of thing seems&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
...  
...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hey. I'm asking since you're from the outside,  
but don't they come off a certain way?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Having a back and forth argument without reserve,  
like there's a lot of trust... It's uhm...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Like, a brother and sister?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Maybe so.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
You're smiling.  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Y-yeah, huh? You think the same. I knew it!   
  
**Ayus:**  
I kind of...think that thing called “family” seems really  
nice.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I've forgotten if this is the natural personality I had  
merely as a prime AI,   
  
**Ayus:**  
or if the feeling was born after becoming a Master  
endowed with a randomized personality.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I find it to be a very warm, happy, and relaxing  
relationship.   
  
**Ayus:**  
So&mdash;I guess it's safe for me to tell you.   
  
**P：Ayus:**  
My wish, if I should win the Holy Grail War,  
is that I want a family.   
  
**P：Ayus:**  
I guess, to be more specific, it's to meet and live with  
that family.   
  
**P：Ayus:**  
That's the sort of vision I kinda have.   
  
**P：Ayus:**  
So if I became the general supervisor AI and were able  
to customize the world,   
  
**P：Ayus:**  
I would compile a way of life for AIs slightly different  
to how it is now.   
  
**P：Ayus:**  
The status quo you've witnessed is already a bit like  
that, just...with more detail and more structure.   
  
**P：Ayus:**  
I'd like to have family relationships that are more  
along those lines.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I think that's...a lovely wish.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(Mixed feelings)  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Ah! Wait, don't get me wrong. Can I apologize!?   
  
**Ayus:**  
I'm not saying at all that I feel like you should concede  
victory. Just...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hey, don't worry. Spit it out. It's important to keep the  
pressure up.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
If there's something you want, don't hesitate.  
Push your claim on what you desire!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Keep pushing even if it's not valid! Because what else  
can you do when you still want it?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That's how I've always lived my life. Just like I'm  
hoping to rent those love god arrows!   
  
**Kama:**  
Like I said, I'm not letting you borrow any.   
  
**Kama:**  
Besides, if that's the creed you lived by, it must've  
caused you no end of trouble back then.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
True, I had something I wanted. I wanted it bad  
enough to start a war over it, and so I went on to fight!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I've no regrets about that. I only knew that it was the  
right thing to do.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Even if I were reborn a million times, I'd do the same  
thing every time.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
And this time's the same as any other. I'll fight for  
what I want.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
We may be allies, but I've got zero intention of losing  
when it all comes down to it. You better be prepared.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
And...what's your wish "this time"?  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Really? Really now? You're really gonna ask?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Fair enough. You'll get your answer. It's&mdash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
EVERYTHING!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Wealth, honor, fame, pleasure, and plenty more.  
Anyway, I want everything that I want.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Don't ask stupid questions like which one I want the  
most. Whatever it is&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...?  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Nah. There's no meaning in whatever it is.   
  
**Ayus:**  
And yet, you've got a habit of eyeballing every  
feminine type when you first meet them. So sleazy.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Erk. That kinda thing, you know, I can't deny.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
My heart's whispering at me to find a woman.  
Probably...a prospective wife, I'd gather.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
More than likely that. The coolest of princes needs a  
wife to match. Hwahaha!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Well, I suppose that's family-like in its own way.  
Provided there's no coercion or anything.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
At any rate, I'm sure to find whatever it is I want if I've  
taken it all beforehand.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Wahaha! Are you starting to comprehend my most  
fantastic of wishes?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That's why my noble self is going the extra mile to  
help bring my Master victory.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
With help from the overseer AI's authority,  
she'll be able to imagine even the creation and all that  
stuff in this small world.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
First we'll build a gargantuan shiny new palace,  
and then stuff it with treasures and tasty food.  
Ghehehe...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ugh. Berserkers really are so selfish, aren't they?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Wrong. Your wish is just too paltry.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I'm left wondering here why you're dwelling on small  
potatoes like family when all your wishes can come  
true.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Is it really worth your while? You don't know the  
ruckus that comes with a hundred brothers.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Do you really think I'm supposed to know from such  
an extreme example? Not that I'm endowed with  
anything but the most plain examples.   
  
**Ayus:**  
But you all know what families are about. I kind of  
envy you for that.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I know. Let me have some practical experience.   
  
**Ayus:**  
If all of you were a family, would that make you a  
[♂ father /♀️ mother] and them your two daughters?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
And proud of them I'd be.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Please take care of us siblings three.  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Uh, would you mind not treating me like a child?  
I just so happen to have this appearance.   
  
**Kama:**  
I'd prefer you not lump me in with the shady  
alchemist.   
  
**Sion:**  
And what's so shady about me? There's nothing to be  
ashamed of regarding my current appearance or  
thinking process.   
  
**Sion:**  
Where ability is concerned, I am not so much a  
daughter or little sister as a peer in whom one can trust  
and find support&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
I had the pretense of “colleagues within an  
organization,” but that's more of a personal preference.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's not a point I'd push on you. For starters,  
there's a question mark as to your satisfaction in that  
regard.   
  
**Sion:**  
Plus, one's position shouldn't be something you  
yourself assert or inquire after...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hahaha. Get along now. Where yours truly stands,  
you're both just stunted parsnips of different stripes.  
Nothing special with you either.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hm? Weren't you describing me the same way?  
I'm an excellent prime AI, you know!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I dunno about that.   
  
**Ayus:**  
You're such a... Hm?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Is there some kind of clamor going on at the home  
base? What could be going on?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Intra-type communications are&mdash;um, down? Odd.   
  
**Sion:**  
I haven't had a chance to check, but do the AIs have  
comms capability?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Those of the same type can essentially network with  
one another.   
  
**Ayus:**  
It's a bit trickier between different types, which  
requires an exchange of individual IDs for one-on-one  
comms.   
  
**Ayus:**  
There are other ways to communicate remotely in  
cases of emergency, but that's the basic gist of it.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Anyway, now it seems like the standard network  
connection between medical types has gone down.   
  
**Ayus:**  
That's why I can't get in touch with the girls at our  
home base...   
  
**Ayus:**  
I have a bad feeling about this. Let's hurry!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Everyone!!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
That's...!  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
You have returned rather late, haven't you?   
  
**???:**  
When going out for a walk, one must remember to  
lock their doors.   
  
**Caster:**  
It's such a risk to be away. Oh yes, quite a risk.  
One never knows what's around the corner...   
  
### Arrow 2 Pre-Battle  
  
**Caster:**  
Hoh, you think you can escape me?   
  
**Caster:**  
Ah... Tremendous.   
  
**Caster:**  
Albeit a lifeless doll! The sensation of my sword  
penetrating a woman's soft skin! Is always tremendous!  
Hahahahaha!   
  
**L：???:**  
You can have your fun, but secure the Raniment first,  
Caster.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hold it! Stop right there!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Caster and...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Are you his Master?  
  
---  
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Do you need to ask?   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
You truly are foolish, Masters of Berserker and  
Assassin.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
The System Grail War is a war of acquiring and  
hoarding resources.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
And since you couldn't even decipher that much,  
you're now giving your precious treasure chest to  
someone more competent, namely me.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Yes, we are of different types, but we're originated  
from the same series.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
If I can parse your network, jamming it is piece of cake.  
But I bet you can't do the same. You're making such a  
foolish face right now.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Tch...! I don't care about any of that, just stay away  
from my girls!   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Why would I?   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
I'm not from the Grow department, but I can easily  
tell what's the most efficient way to harvest Raniment  
from this world:   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Steal it from others.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Don't tell me you thought you had enough in your own  
place? That's honest to a fault.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
That'd be&mdash;oh, how foolish. To think you'd fail  
to notice the only logical answer.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
It's almost unfair that the randomizer would induce  
such a difference in ability.   
  
**Kama:**  
I really don't know why but this guy makes me  
wholeheartedly&mdash;   
  
**Kama:**  
Pissed off.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
If you want it, steal it. Well, I can't really argue against  
that.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
But the only ones allowed to do so are those like  
yours truly, blessed with high birth, good looks,  
and combat strength.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
For a brat like you, the very idea is absurd!   
  
**Sion:**  
Conflict seems unavoidable...but be careful.   
  
**Sion:**  
According to my calculations, the fact that he's  
showed his face&mdash;   
  
### Arrow 2 Post-Battle  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Tch...!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Even estimating all his actions, we can't overcome this  
difference in physical and energetical resources!   
  
**Caster:**  
Ah...good. The powerful violate the powerless.  
The rightful punish the wrongful.   
  
**Caster:**  
This is providence in its natural form. How, how,  
howHowhoWhowHoWhOW...   
  
**Caster:**  
How! COMFORTING!   
  
**Caster:**  
I am just! Just! JusT jUst JUST juSt jjjj! Who is  
laughing now! Apologize, apologize, APOLOGIZE!   
  
**Caster:**  
Heheh. I smell blood. Ah, I smell blood. Was it ye who  
longed so for this perfume?   
  
**Caster:**  
Yes, this is a just punishment. As you promised me.  
Thus, in my secret room, you'll find hell.   
  
**Caster:**  
Devoured down to the bone by the ones crawling the  
darkness: my worm fiends&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ah...aaaaah...   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
This went so according to plan it didn't even feel like  
it was worth my time, idiots. Learn to calculate  
properly.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Did you, despite fighting, go to the general supervisor  
without stopping to recharge first?   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Then it's obvious that my fully recharged Caster  
would have more Raniment than both of you combined.   
  
**Kama:**  
...   
  
**Kama:**  
(I hate to admit it, but he's right. We can't even  
compare to the amount of gas he still has left in the  
tank... We're not making it out of this one like  
this&mdash;)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Did you call me an idiot!? You...you idiot kid!   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
What else am I supposed to call someone who doesn't  
use their head and wanders around with no  
preparations?   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
You thought you were safer just by having a partner?  
You thought that was all it took to compete against  
my competence?   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Beyond foolish. Now you have two Servants in one  
area. Which means you only get half your supply.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Two weak Servants don't make any difference.  
Use your head more, idiot!   
  
**Ayus:**  
(I could give him a temporary boost in Raniment...  
if I use my Command Spell.)   
  
**Ayus:**  
(But...what if that's not enough to win?)   
  
**Ayus:**  
(And if I do win, I'll be without it for the battles to  
come... Should I...?)   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
It's over. You all lost to my elite capabilities and  
superiority. That's all there is to it.   
  
**L：???:**  
Really now? Then what if there were three Servants?   
  
### Arrow 3  
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Wha&mdash;  
Who are you people...!?   
  
**A：???:**  
Tourists. Though I guess you could say there's no  
sense in dragging shit out.   
  
**A：???:**  
This here's the Rider Servant, and I'm his Master.   
  
**A：???:**  
The name's...heheh, it's a funny one despite my AI  
roots. But I had to give myself some kinda moniker  
when I got all Masterfied.   
  
**A：???:**  
Needed to go with somethin', after all.  
From the top then, I'm&mdash;   
  
**A：???:**  
My name's Lainur.  
Lainur Gusion.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...!  
  
---  
  
**Lainur:**  
So that's Caster? I came down to engage the services  
of Repair.   
  
**Lainur:**  
You're welcome to join the queue if they're handing  
out numbered tickets for the future, but if not&mdash;   
  
**Lainur:**  
Maybe you oughta just come back later. You can't be  
sure how much strength my side's saved up.   
  
**Lainur:**  
However clear the present situation's inequalities may  
seem, the addition of one unknown renders the  
equation moot.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Tch...   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Huh, hmph. Fair enough. We've enriched our resources  
well enough at the expense of yours.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Those as outstanding as us cannot afford to risk losing.  
We can proceed whenever prudent to do so...   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Move out, Caster.   
  
**Caster:**  
Yes... True enough, there is no sport in punishing them  
so easily.   
  
**Caster:**  
We must give them far greater cause to show terror.  
Enough to prostrate their heads on the floor to beg  
my forgiveness.   
  
**Ayus:**  
That should do it for first aid on my R-type girls.  
If the ones that disappeared were still here...   
  
**Ayus:**  
At any rate...I've been saved once again.   
  
**Ayus:**  
My thanks, Rider. And to your Master too...  
Will that suffice?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Like I said, it's no lie that I'm the prime AI of the  
Transfer section, as well as Master of Rider.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(Professor Lev...?)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(Lainur...?)  
  
---  
  
**Lainur:**  
Hm? What're ya eyeballing me for?  
Is there someone I resemble?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Pretty weird. The randomizer's supposed to have a  
perfect random generation function...   
  
**Lainur:**  
But hey, small wonder when it spits out guys who're  
so spiritually screwed up. It's always possible a  
template or something was put to use.   
  
**Lainur:**  
It could mean we were chosen randomly from that set.   
  
**Lainur:**  
In that vein, it's a totally different deal from you  
knowing a guy with the same face. Don't worry about it.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
And him...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Rider, Lanling Wang...?  
  
---  
  
**Rider:**  
...  
...   
  
**Lainur:**  
Oh, c'mon. You're tellin' me you know his face too?  
He's wearing a mask, but you know what I mean.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I got no luck here...but these True Name gimmicks  
were bound to come out sometime. Feel like sayin' hi or  
something?   
  
**Rider:**  
I will do so if ordered to. If not, I have no such  
intention.   
  
**Rider:**  
All I am is a tool.   
  
**Rider:**  
I would utter a different name as well, as I am no  
prince.   
  
**Rider:**  
Even in the event I were called such a thing,  
it is not who I am here and now.   
  
**Rider:**  
I am naught but a blade, a mere warrior.  
Merely&mdash;Gao Changgong.   
  
**Kama:**  
Oh, what a chilly reception. I do feel a rather high wall  
set in your heart.   
  
**Kama:**  
Brushing it seems to hold the risk of suffering a very  
real cut.   
  
**Sion:**  
Gao Changgong... That name is still associated with  
the general known as Lanling Wang.   
  
**Sion:**  
Or is the name particular to the Rider class?   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
...  
...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
So? What's the Rider faction's business here?   
  
**Lainur:**  
It oughta go without saying. I dropped by to let our  
Servants duel to the death, as a competitor in the  
System Grail War&mdash;   
  
**Lainur:**  
Or how about none of that, given that we're in Repair?  
I brought by a subordinate who I was hopin' you'd fix  
up.   
  
**Lainur:**  
We can kill each other any old time.  
I've got more important shit to do, ya see.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
What, now?   
  
**J：Transfer AI:**  
H E L L O. I am a Transfer AI, specifically, a T-type of  
the R.A.N.I series.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
I am very embarrassed to admit that I suffered an  
accident while carrying out my duties. I was surprised  
by a bug that suddenly popped out.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ah, is that right? So these two came as escorts to see  
your injury treated?   
  
**Rani-T:**  
E X A C T L Y.   
  
**Ayus:**  
You went out of your way to saunter into your  
enemy's midst, the Repair home base, in the middle of  
a Holy Grail War?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Put it like that, I do get your drift. It's not like we had  
to come here to get treatment.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I could just as easily flag down and ask a Repair-type  
who's in another partition on official business,   
  
**Lainur:**  
or send in a request, or use a roadside emergency  
repair kit if I felt like it.   
  
**Lainur:**  
But&ndash;since gettin' this Master thing in my system,  
a little bit of desire's been created in the process.   
  
**Lainur:**  
The kinda desire that makes ya wanna look around...  
check things out.   
  
**Lainur:**  
That's part of the reason I made the trip. I mean,  
there's a whole lotta things these fresh eyes haven't  
seen first-hand.   
  
**Lainur:**  
So I was hopin' you'd gimme a tour.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Yeah... I'd call that weird.   
  
**Ayus:**  
What do you think, Fujimaru?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
It's hard to find the right words here, but...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
He warrants a degree of caution either way...I think.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
That's both true and justified. I'm relieved to hear  
some rational thinking.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Hahah, you might be right.   
  
**Lainur:**  
So how 'bout I only move around within your guys'  
visibility?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Plus, I'll give Rider orders not to do a damn thing.   
  
**Lainur:**  
There's no way I'd be able to whip something  
together right in front of you, and no way to wreak  
havoc on my own. Right?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
In that case... I guess...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
As long as you stay in sight, then.  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
I wonder if Rider over there is okay with his Master  
taking unilateral action?   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
If I am given an order, I will follow it. All I am is a tool.   
  
**Kama:**  
Hmmm...   
  
**Lainur:**  
I know, lemme borrow an R-type to play tour guide.  
That way it's less annoyin' for me to call anybody  
over.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Right then, first we'll check out the therapy pods and  
medical kits...   
  
**Lainur:**  
No, maybe start with this building? I seem to be stuck  
on everythin' that didn't draw my interest before...   
  
**Kama:**  
I have to second that this is still weird. Does anything  
else bear comment?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
So he really came here for treatment and a tour?  
I guess we do owe him one for driving off Caster.   
  
**Sion:**  
And yet...I truly feel no hostility from that Master or  
his Servant.   
  
**Sion:**  
Though I do get a strong sense of discretion,  
or at least, an unsociable will.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
...  
...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(I don't think he's even making eye contact.)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(Just keep an eye on each other...)  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
That should do it. Scan executed&mdash;and  
confirmation complete.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
I admire such treatment akin to a S P E E D S T E R as  
much as our own work. Here is some Raniment as  
thanks.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Thanks for that. Now, back to that Master...   
  
**Lainur:**  
Humm, haww. What future will this lead to...  
Most certainly...a world close to perfection...   
  
**Lainur:**  
Real damn fascinating.  
Oh, there you are. All done?   
  
**Rani-T:**  
E X A C T L Y.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(He hasn't escaped my sight.)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(Yet he hasn't done anything suspicious...)  
  
---  
  
**Lainur:**  
All right, we're outta here.   
  
**Kama:**  
You mean to say you really came here just for this?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Whatever more I could say, that's all there is.   
  
**Lainur:**  
The future's moving forward at high speed.  
We've got no time to sit around and eat its dust.   
  
**Ayus:**  
But you're at least saying...you have no intent to fight  
us today?   
  
**Lainur:**  
True that. Pick a fight and it might all be over.  
I get the feelin' like that's still a waste.   
  
**Lainur:**  
But what do you make of Caster? His Master's  
character looked all too warlike to me.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I'm sure they'll continue to make the first move.  
Though I can't say if it'll be here or elsewhere.   
  
**Sion:**  
No doubt. I've calculated that much.   
  
**Lainur:**  
While I'm talking, I'm willin' to pay for the tour with  
information on top of Raniment.   
  
**Lainur:**  
We on the Rider side of things are over in Transfer.  
We got the edge over the others in mobility, AI or not.   
  
**Lainur:**  
And most of the partitions' goings-on have been  
scouted out.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I oughta say that it's only a rough idea of things.  
There wasn't a thorough investigation.   
  
**Lainur:**  
As you probably know, Caster's off in Build.   
  
**Lainur:**  
And it's more than likely Saber's at Grow and Lancer  
is at Keep.   
  
**Kama:**  
Where were those, and what were they again?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Right here.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Adjacent to us in Repair are Build and Transfer.   
  
**Ayus:**  
And here, you have Grow and Keep.   
  
**Kama:**  
Hmm, all clear then.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I guess it goes without sayin' after your bunch got  
attacked that the most aggressive side so far happens  
to be Caster's.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Indications are that Saber's and Lancer's have yet to  
proactively mount an attack.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I got no clue whether those Masters aren't warlike or  
if they're craftily building up their strength instead.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That's...Lancer's status?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Yeah, ya got it. Not one sign of him. I don't think he's  
even stepped outta their partition yet.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Not warlike. Possibly crafty...)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Ridiculous. Is that even possible? It's HIM&mdash;)   
  
**Ayus:**  
What's wrong, Berserker?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Eh...? What could be wrong with me? Yours truly is the  
same as always.   
  
**Lainur:**  
All right, we'll be heading home right about now.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Hey, I'm sure we'll be meetin' again&mdash;in the near  
future. That's the one thing ya can count on.   
  
**Lainur:**  
The question is, which route to take?   
  
**Rani-T:**  
(Glinting shine)   
  
**Rani-T:**  
As in whether your Transfer's express travel asset or  
Rider's fine steed might make the trip faster?   
  
**Rani-T:**  
I took that to be the manner of your Q U E S T I O N.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Eh? Haha, that wasn't my aim at all.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
Shall we race? We are the proud S P E E D S T E R S  
of this world. There will be no losing if we are  
challenged.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
...  
...   
  
**Rani-T:**  
Not a word.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Still not talkin' with anyone but me, Rider?   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
If ordered to, I shall. If not, I won't. That's all there is  
to it, Master.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
I will repeat it as often as I must.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Please do not expect me to make any moves on my  
own initiative.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
I will never take action on my own. Not to fight and  
not to use my Noble Phantasm.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
I'll take no action whatsoever of my own will.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
In return, I honor my Master's every command.  
That's all I amount to.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
If a Master expects their Servant to tread beyond their  
expected bounds,   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
that would surely make me into a wretched,  
evil Servant.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
I am merely a sword. Nay, as a Rider, truly no  
different than a mere horse.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Simply point my nose in the direction I am told to go,  
and only run when I am told to run.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
(That's right&mdash;)   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
(Because the fate of a horse that runs as it pleases  
despite its reins goes without saying.)   
  
**Lainur:**  
Psh. If I had to pick one or the other, I'd say my  
character leans more towards calculation than instinct.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I 'preciate how much quicker on the uptake we can be  
with fewer uncertainties in the picture.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I'm not that unhappy with the way ya do things.  
Just try to give it your best for the future's sake.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
Then what will you do now?   
  
**Rani-T:**  
We would regret missing a chance to show off our  
superior S T Y L E. Hairpin curves are our specialty.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
...  
...   
  
**Rani-T:**  
Not a word.   
  
**Lainur:**  
(Sigh) Well, point of fact, I don't really care how  
quick I go or anythin'.   
  
**Lainur:**  
If you're simply in a hurry, just use your own machine.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
I recall that your own express travel asset was a  
special bike, leader.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
The one with the handlebars all splayed out.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Yeah, I left my chopper behind at HQ.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Just moving around fast is fine and well, but right now  
I'm making both detailed observations and measuring  
variables.   
  
**Lainur:**  
There's more profit found in taking the comprehensive  
view by dedicatin' some attention there while on the  
move.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Isn't that why I picked you up and shuttled you here  
on Rider's horse?   
  
**Rani-T:**  
Then...do you have no use for your S P E E D S T E R S?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Never said that, everything just has its time and place.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I was only plannin' on going back to HQ for now to  
consolidate this information.   
  
**Lainur:**  
It's also worthwhile to give Rider some downtime.   
  
**Lainur:**  
So this time we'll head back on your express asset.  
But there's no need to gun it all the way.   
  
**Lainur:**  
If I discover something of interest on the way back,  
I obviously mean to wholeheartedly investigate&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
Now then. We'll need to update our comm protocols.   
  
**Ayus:**  
That way we can get back in touch quickly in the event  
anything should go wrong.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Its encryption...and of course, higher signal strength...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
You okay...?  
  
**Ayus:**  
Of course I am. I'm certainly sad to see them go...  
but I can't be stuck in a rut over it.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
If there's anything I can do to help...  
  
**Ayus:**  
No, not to worry. This really is my role as a prime AI.   
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
So all of you can go ahead and get some rest.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I can sleep after I've finished all the work that needs  
doing. Don't worry about me.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
How do all of you usually sleep?  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
The girls on night shift stick to their duties,  
with the others taking a control pod.   
  
**Ayus:**  
About your group... Uhm, what should we do?   
  
**Ayus:**  
The control pods designed for AIs are rather rugged.  
I don't think they're the most comfortable choice.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Anywhere's fine.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I'm used to roughing it.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
For the time being, we'll be okay as long as there's a  
place to lie down.   
  
**Sion:**  
Although it'd be best if there were such a room that  
would allow all three of us to rest at the same time.   
  
**Sion:**  
We'd like to avoid having three single rooms.   
  
**Kama:**  
I don't suppose you're being cautious around me...?  
Or do you have your own scheme in mind?   
  
**Sion:**  
That's not limited to you, but anything that might  
threaten Fujimaru during [♂ his /♀️ her] sleep period.   
  
**Sion:**  
Simply an optimal solution for a top priority issue.  
Or do you have anything to add?   
  
**Kama:**  
...  
...   
  
**Ayus:**  
I feel like things just took an awkward turn,  
but it might just be me.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Lots of rooms do meet your requirements, so I'll show  
you to whichever's best. Have a good rest then!   
  
**Sion:**  
Not too wide, not too narrow. It's no sleeper carriage,  
just a stage with space with room for three to lie  
down.   
  
**Sion:**  
I think it earns passing marks for lines of sight on both  
intruder precautions and incidental escape routes.   
  
**Kama:**  
Good, then it's time we went to bed. Let us be  
immersed in lapses right up close and impossible to  
escape.   
  
**Kama:**  
I will, of course, be your escort...   
  
**Sion:**  
Your area is over there. I don't mind forcing you to  
move with my Etherlite.   
  
**Kama:**  
...  
...   
  
**Kama:**  
Fine then, I get it.   
  
**Kama:**  
Hmph to you. What's so bad about sharing a bed?  
It's all in the name of better protecting [♂ him /♀️ her].   
  
**Kama:**  
Honestly, you're a real third wheel...   
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...   
  
**Sion:**  
(I knew it... Something does feel wrong.)   
  
**Sion:**  
(Kama. Could she really be the same one who was in  
Chaldea...?)   
  
### Arrow 4  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Struggling to sleep, Fujimaru?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sorry, did I wake you up?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
You didn't. You may have forgotten, but we're  
connected via Etherlight.   
  
**Sion:**  
In situations of rest like this, I'm essentially in a  
constant state of monitoring your physical state.   
  
**Sion:**  
I immediately noticed you'd awakened... As well as  
the sudden spike in your pulse.   
  
**Kama:**  
Why IS your heart beating so fast?  
I haven't snuck into your bed yet.   
  
**Kama:**  
Well...I can guess the answer.   
  
**Kama:**  
But I wanna hear you say it out loud. I'm all ears.   
  
**Kama:**  
Until now you've been avoiding looking at me.  
You made no mention of it.   
  
**Kama:**  
But now&mdash;you've reached your limit.   
  
**Kama:**  
Am I right...about your desire?   
  
**Narration:**  
I have to admit...ever since I came to this world,  
there's been something on the edge of my mind.   
  
**Narration:**  
Something I've been pushing away, hoping I wouldn't  
have to think about.   
  
**Narration:**  
But that wasn't right.   
  
**Narration:**  
I need to clearly state it wasn't.   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;To whom?   
  
**Narration:**  
To myself, of course.   
  
**Narration:**  
Something I don't want to avert my eyes from.  
Something I don't want to pretend like it's not my  
problem.   
  
**Narration:**  
The irritation piercing my heart compels me,   
  
**Narration:**  
to the point I can't allow myself to sleep if it will make  
me forget it.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I don't think AIs...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
should be disposable like that...!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
&mdash;I predicted you'd say that.  
All according to my calculations.   
  
**Kama:**  
They're lifeless products at their core. Shams running  
on programs.   
  
**Kama:**  
Are you saying what you saw was unforgivable  
regardless?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
&mdash;I am.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
I come from a lineage of alchemists driven by logic.  
Here's my opinion as such:   
  
**Sion:**  
Strictly considering the rules of the world and the  
conditions of the war, I can't deny Caster's actions are  
logical.   
  
**Sion:**  
This Grail War is, at its core, a competition over the  
AI's magical energy-equivalent resources.   
  
**Sion:**  
With each team having their own base of operations,  
the most efficient thing to do is to steal from other  
territories.   
  
**Sion:**  
This robbery is irreversible.   
  
**Sion:**  
Meaning, killing other teams' AI and stealing their  
Raniment is a two birds in one stone strategy: both  
offense and supply.   
  
**Sion:**  
This is a hard fact.   
  
**Sion:**  
This is a possibility I acknowledged when thinking  
logically about our immediate need to win.   
  
**Sion:**  
However&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I'd never do that,  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
or let Duryodhana's team do it.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
No, you wouldn't.   
  
**Sion:**  
Also according to my calculations. I know Chaldea's  
success in subduing Goetia.   
  
**Kama:**  
Ngh. This I-know-you-well look in her eyes is making  
me livid...   
  
**Kama:**  
Humph. I won't let you steal my role of being  
supportive and indulgent in everything.   
  
**Kama:**  
I know letting an amateur take my role will only come  
back to bite me later.   
  
**Kama:**  
That's how love works.   
  
**Kama:**  
&mdash;Okay, final check. They're probably not living  
beings.   
  
**Kama:**  
They're probably replaceable beings that will just be  
restocked with time.   
  
**Kama:**  
Does this matter to you?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
It doesn't. When I see their eyes asking for help,  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I don't want to go on without helping them.  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Sure...   
  
**Kama:**  
Well, what you're choosing to do here is what you  
were already doing before, so nothing's changed.   
  
**Kama:**  
No further comments from me. Bleh.   
  
**Sion:**  
Our future policy was decided and verbalized,  
so I can't say the conversation was pointless.   
  
**Sion:**  
We will win the AI Holy Grail War in order to return to  
the outside world.   
  
**Sion:**  
We will cooperate with Berserker until we are the final  
two left, and share their supplying territory.   
  
**Sion:**  
We won't erase AIs to steal resources for a short-term  
restock,   
  
**Sion:**  
nor will we allow our enemies to do so&mdash;not  
even our cooperating Berserker.   
  
**Sion:**  
Are we agreed?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Yeah...  
  
**Sion:**  
I already knew.   
  
**Sion:**  
You treasure this way of fighting.   
  
**Sion:**  
You act not for rationality or utility, but for something  
formless within your heart.   
  
**Sion:**  
That's not something I'm capable of.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Probably not the most logical route.  
  
**Sion:**  
I don't mind. Logic doesn't decide everything.  
People don't always agree on what's most optimal.   
  
**Sion:**  
That's, um&mdash;what they call...   
  
**Sion:**  
I already knew.   
  
**Sion:**  
You treasure this way of fighting.   
  
**Sion:**  
You act not for rationality or utility, but for something  
formless within your heart.   
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Policy discussion concluded.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sorry about this, Sion.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Don't be. I'll be with you no matter how much of  
shackle or a burden you turn out to be.   
  
**Sion:**  
My calculations say we can escape 100% unharmed.  
You have nothing to apologize for.   
  
**Sion:**  
Now, if there's nothing else we need to discuss,  
I'll return to sleep.   
  
**Kama:**  
Oh, I do have a question.   
  
**Kama:**  
You knowing who that Rider Servant was is no big  
deal, happens all the time...   
  
**Kama:**  
But the way you reacted to Rider's Master wasn't  
normal, was it?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I can't remember it too clearly...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
But he's someone I can't feel comfortable around.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
I couldn't tell from your reaction whether or not you  
knew the name he went by.   
  
**Sion:**  
You're probably imagining things.   
  
**Sion:**  
The versions of us here are only portions of our  
normal selves.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's easy to find bugs in the domain of our memories.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's more of a hardware failure than a software one,  
so my Etherlight can intervene with it.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's vexing not to have an answer, but I believe this is  
not something we should be wasting brainpower on at  
the moment.   
  
**Sion:**  
As he said, he's the product of a randomizer...  
A prime AI converted into a Master.   
  
**Sion:**  
Either real-life models are involved in the process,  
or it works by randomly choosing one of those  
pre-made models.   
  
**Sion:**  
Basically...we have an idea of who his model is,  
but can't remember it.   
  
**Sion:**  
Any thoughts on his personality, by the way?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
He...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Feels like someone else entirely...I think...?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
All right. If his appearance data is the only usable part,  
he must have been someone of low importance...   
  
**Sion:**  
But I still don't know enough to safely judge.   
  
**Sion:**  
Do you remember anyone similar to Caster's Master  
or Ayus?   
  
**Sion:**  
If you don't, all we have to resort to is careful  
observation.   
  
**Kama:**  
Always strange things happening in this world.   
  
**Kama:**  
One familiar face is overwritten by an AI, another gets  
small. Stay always alert.   
  
**Kama:**  
Either way, if the conversation is over, then let's get  
some sleep.   
  
**Kama:**  
Want me to do something to prevent you from having  
nightmares?   
  
**Kama:**  
I have some ideas that could work.   
  
**Kama:**  
Like, you can rest better if you hug a perfectly sized  
body pillow. Just as an example&ndash;   
  
**Sion:**  
Good night.   
  
**Sion:**  
Forced sleep induction, activate.  
Three, two, one&mdash;   
  
**Kama:**  
Wha! HEY!   
  
### Arrow 5   
  
**Ayus:**  
Done, comms security reinforced. The damaged spots  
seem cleaned up well enough too. Yeah, looking good!   
  
**Ayus:**  
New morning, new me!  
Let's start the day on our best moods, girls!   
  
**The Rani-Rs:**  
Aye.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Good morning.  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Good morning. Did you sleep well?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Fine enough!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
[♂ He /♀️ She] has Etherlight taking care of [♂ his /♀️ her] health.  
No abnormalities detected at the moment.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Good morning. We're here to greet you for your return  
from the central area.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Good morning, welcome back.  
Are you hurt? You don't seem to be.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Good morning, welcome back.  
Damage scan... 0 results.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
No damage in last night's battle. Or was it determined  
that everything was already healed? What a shame.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Good morning, welcome back.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
I'm in no way disappointed, but please understand  
that missing out on an opportunity to show off my  
ability can be a letdown.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Think of it solely as a display of enthusiasm.   
  
**Sion:**  
[♂ He /♀️ She] sure is popular... They're forming a crowd around  
[♂ him /♀️ her].   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hehe, they just want to show off.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Well, we Repair-types are prone to wanting to fill up  
what's unfilled.   
  
**Ayus:**  
The chance to treat someone who isn't a typical AI is  
a rare treat.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Though I still think the need to repay  
Fujimaru's help plays a huge part in it.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Ngh. It should be me in the center of the squeeing  
squad.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Not the most pleasant thing to wake up to.  
Enough, shoo!   
  
**D：Rani-R:**  
Report: Tyranny.   
  
**E：Rani-R:**  
Report: You're being a bother.   
  
**B：Rani-R:**  
I'll have to comply and proceed to the default  
Distance Mode, but I'm considering lowering your  
likeability rate in the internal personal ranking&mdash;   
  
**C：Rani-R:**  
Update accepted. You're now at the bottom tier.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hey, ain't that a serious issue to my deserved status as  
everyone's favorite?   
  
**B：Rani-R:**  
You must be imagining it.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hehe, I love this bustling atmosphere.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Similarly-typed companions who know each other's  
dispositions exchanging information at leisure&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Yeah, just like a family.  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Yup. You think so too? Hehe, I'm glad you remember  
our talk from yesterday.   
  
**Sion:**  
Of course we do. As we remember your uncalled-for  
conclusion that Kama and I fit as [♂ his /♀️ her] daughters.   
  
**Sion:**  
I must remind you not to infantilize me every time this  
topic of conversation comes up.   
  
**Sion:**  
After all, I can measure myself as three centimeters  
taller than Kama.   
  
**Sion:**  
Therefore, I'd like to assert that it's inaccurate to pair  
us together.   
  
**Sion:**  
In addition&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
Wait a second... Where IS Kama?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
She was just here!  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
What's this fuss all about? I'm right here.   
  
**Kama:**  
I was just outside picking some flowers, getting  
changed into something better looking, no big deal.  
Hehehe.   
  
**Sion:**  
...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
You've gotten bigger...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Why now...?  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
N-no reason. I just wanted to start a new morning on  
a new leaf.   
  
**Kama:**  
There was nothing particularly unpleasant about being  
in a smaller form, understood?   
  
**Kama:**  
I know you understand me. Right, my Master...?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Huh, how did you get this big!? Did you install a new  
avatar program?   
  
**Kama:**  
Heh, that phrasing was more accurate than you think.  
Yes, I just changed my appearance and I'm still the  
same on the inside.   
  
**Kama:**  
That's right. It's like changing clothes. Don't think too  
hard about it, it doesn't mean anything in particular.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Aye. Servant or not, I figured a Divine Spirit would be  
capable of as much. I envy the ability to change  
appearances at will.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Though I do think the change was abrupt.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I wonder why she did it?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Can't think of a reason.  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Really, you can't?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...  
...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Wahahahaha! There's the answer to my question of  
what kind of human the god of love could work for!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You see, women on the battlefield don't want to be  
seen fighting with the same weapon as another.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I hear they get antsy from simply seeing another wear  
the same color. The same logic applies here.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Being a god doesn't change that.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...?  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Oh my, that's one nasty glare. My lips are sealed.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Whatever. We need to restock on Raniment-laced  
materials. Any ideas?   
  
**Sion:**  
Raniment is a conceptual factor analogous to magical  
energy. And materials refer to the base substances that  
compose this world, right?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Yeah. In simpler terms, that'd be food.   
  
**Ayus:**  
The people at Keep modify the raw material produced  
by Grow to contain tiny amounts of Raniment.  
Here's one.   
  
**Sion:**  
And by ingesting these...you AI replenish magical  
energy and recover from material deterioration?   
  
**Sion:**  
I see. That is indeed how food works.   
  
**Ayus:**  
The Raniment we gain through this balances out our  
natural consumption, meaning this just preserves the  
status quo.   
  
**Ayus:**  
It won't give us any advantages in combat.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Since you're in the same standing as an AI,  
I think you can eat it. Will you try?   
  
**Sion:**  
It's important to stay energized. After the Etherlight  
confirms it's safe for consumption, we'll be glad to  
have some.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Wait. I have a report.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Leader, Keep has been sending this kind of material  
lately. Do you know it?   
  
**Ayus:**  
That's new to me. What is it?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Looks like...Indian naan?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Looks delicious.  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...   
  
**Rani-T:**  
H E L L O. I've delivered this.   
  
**Ayus:**  
You... By your identification number, you're the girl  
who came here with Rider yesterday, aren't you?   
  
**Rani-T:**  
Y E S. Thank you for having me.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
The ever grateful S P E E D S T E R, always delivering  
the latest goods at top priority.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Thank you for that. Here's your Raniment.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
It's been a pleasure.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
...(Staring)   
  
**Sion:**  
Do you still need anything?   
  
**Rani-T:**  
You may not know, but we from Transfer accept tips.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
We're competitive AI, with each one trying to be the  
top unit despite lacking significant differences in speed.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
So receiving tips is our greatest form of joy.   
  
**Ayus:**  
True, I forgot about that. What can I give extra...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Do you have anything?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Not really.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
How about you?  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Fine, I'll do it.   
  
**Kama:**  
I can craft something with a flowery motif.  
Do you mind a decorative item?   
  
**Rani-T:**  
G O O D. I evolved into a fancy S P E E D S T E R like  
no other.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
Thank you for your business.   
  
**Sion:**  
Now to verify the safety of these kind gifts.   
  
**Sion:**  
Per the Etherlight's examination, this is fundamentally  
no different from an energy bar.   
  
**Sion:**  
It only had its surrounding data carefully arranged to  
add the unnecessary decorations.   
  
**Sion:**  
Those being smell and flavor, in sensory terms.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Functionally identical.  
Doesn't make a difference for us,   
  
**Rani-R:**  
but we speculate this new one might be of easier  
consumption for you from the outside.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Thank you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Don't mind if I do!  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
If this replenishes magical energy...Raniment,  
then I guess I'll have some.   
  
**Kama:**  
What about you, Berserker?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...Like I can eat that. Keep it all for yourselves.   
  
**Kama:**  
...?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That confirms it&mdash;I didn't see it wrong.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
He's here. In this world...   
  
**K：???:**  
...Hmph. The wind feels weirdly restless today.  
Are we getting cold feet, or&mdash;   
  
**Keep AI:**  
Chef. Your quality check, please.   
  
**K：???:**  
Sure. Got any creative ideas?   
  
**Keep AI:**  
We don't require creativity. All we preservation  
AI—K-types—need is reliability.   
  
**L：Keep AI (Rani-K):**  
You must be wondering then why we are learning  
from your processing methods, chef.   
  
**L：Keep AI (Rani-K):**  
There are multiple factors at play in this, but the  
general answer is that a merit vs demerit comparison  
proved&mdash;   
  
**K：???:**  
That's a lot of words just to say you guys like tasty  
better than tasteless.   
  
**K：???:**  
There's nothing weird about it.   
  
**K：???:**  
Gimme your thing to taste test. Hmm...   
  
**K：???:**  
Nowhere near my level, but that gets a passing grade.  
You can proudly give it to anyone who wants some.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
Your reliable Transfer S P E E D S T E R at your  
service.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
We will deliver your processed goods.  
L E T' S G O. Feel the wind.   
  
**K：???:**  
And that's done... I'm gonna go check how Master's  
doing. Don't know about you, but I'm really proud of  
today's batch.   
  
**???:**  
(Sigh)...   
  
**K：???:**  
Yo! What's up, Master? Feeling better after tasting my  
cooking?   
  
**K：???:**  
Oh, thanks, I know what this empty plate means.   
  
**K：???:**  
I managed to put cheese inside an already delicious  
naan.   
  
**K：???:**  
Well, a data recreation of that. But if it has the same  
taste, then it doesn't make a difference.   
  
**???:**  
...  
...   
  
**K：???:**  
Okay... Still not feeling better after my good meal, huh?   
  
**???:**  
I'm not hungry or sick, Lancer.   
  
**???:**  
This is how I always am.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Hmm. And yet, my cooking always managed to cheer  
my brothers up.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Even while we were exiled. No matter how sad or  
painful it got.   
  
**???:**  
That doesn't make me your sister.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Good point, Master.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Still... Something's not right.   
  
**Lancer:**  
I'm sure I can make you feel better.   
  
**Lancer:**  
I'm really sure you're not in your best health and spirit...  
No proof though.   
  
**M：Lancer's Master:**  
(None, really...?)   
  
**Lancer:**  
That's why my goal is to find the dish that can cheer  
you up before anything! I can't fight until I do!   
  
**M：Lancer's Master:**  
I don't know a lot about you, but aren't you a strong  
hero? You can fight all you want without me.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Hahaha. Cooking is more important than combat.   
  
**Lancer:**  
If I can't get a smile out of Master, that means my  
cooking is not as good as it needed to be.   
  
**Lancer:**  
I'm not trying to make you fall in love or think I'm the  
best chef ever.   
  
**Lancer:**  
It's just not to put shame on the joy my brothers and  
the people at the palace felt eating my meals.   
  
**M：Lancer's Master:**  
Were you some kind of hero of culinary arts?   
  
**Lancer:**  
Good question. All can say for sure is&mdash;my chef  
persona is still unquestionably part of me.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Anyhoo! If today's best piece failed to cheer you up,   
  
**Lancer:**  
then I just have to keep trying until I find something  
that suits your taste!   
  
**Lancer:**  
Mgh, I'll need more ingredients.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Restock time, then. I'm gonna procure some materials!   
  
**M：Lancer's Master:**  
...Bye.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Why don't you join me, Master?  
Isn't that how Holy Grail Wars usually go?   
  
**M：Lancer's Master:**  
I...can't do anything...in a fight...   
  
**Lancer:**  
We're not going for a fight. We're going for materials.   
  
**Lancer:**  
I won't do anything until my cooking makes you smile.  
That's the first priority I decided on.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Fighting comes second!   
  
**Lancer:**  
C'mon, Master. I can carry you piggyback if you don't  
wanna walk!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That battle junkie...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
He's trying to get in my way again...!   
  
### Arrow 6 Pre-Battle  
  
**Ayus:**  
(Chew) Hmm, still can't get used to this sensation.  
This is what flavor is?   
  
**Ayus:**  
It's not bad by any means, but how do I put it...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ehehehe.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Is this what “delicious” is? My happiness values are  
raising.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
That's great to hear.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
That is what delicious is.  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
When did this update happen though?   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Unconfirmed, but I believe it was when the System  
Grail War begun.   
  
**Sion:**  
This is made by Keep, which has a Master and a  
Servant.   
  
**Sion:**  
My calculations give a high probability of this being an  
influence. What do you think?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Sounds likely.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hey, do you know of any other changes to the world?  
Even if they're just rumors.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Let me see. In terms of clear changes, we have...   
  
**Rani-R:**  
The B-type AIs from Build are generally slower on the  
job.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Build... Where Caster might be.   
  
**Ayus:**  
The bad guy tormenting our R-types and forcibly  
stealing Raniment.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Could the girls from his partition be&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
...  
...   
  
**Ayus:**  
No, I have my own to worry about first.   
  
**Ayus:**  
We need to do our part.   
  
**Ayus:**  
The first thing we need to do is be more alert while  
we stockpile Raniment...   
  
**Ayus:**  
...against Caster's&ndash;no, any other Servant's  
meddling.   
  
**Ayus:**  
This meal is worth its time, but we need something on  
a bigger level.   
  
**Ayus:**  
We really need to earn on a level that can properly  
fuel us in combat.   
  
**Sion:**  
Not only that&mdash;we need to restock faster than  
our opponents.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(Can we really outpace him...?)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(Someone who'd go to those cruel lengths...?)  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Like I said! That just means we have to give it our all!   
  
**Ayus:**  
But I suppose saying that doesn't explain anything...  
Once we're done eating, follow me.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I'll show you what Repair does!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Looking forward to it!  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Oh, Berserker. What's wrong?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Huh! That's mine!   
  
**Ayus:**  
I already had the necessary amount, so I don't mind,  
I really don't, but I was saving the last piece to savor  
later!   
  
**Ayus:**  
What gives? Didn't you say you didn't want to eat?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Shut up! I can't help an empty stomach!  
I just felt like it all of a sudden!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
The ingredients are not to blame for who the cook is!  
I'm just following the principle of not wasting food!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(I'll win... I must. Next time I will. No matter what it  
takes.)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Thus, I must cultivate myself to full power.)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(I shan't lose to that coward again&mdash;)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Chomp) (Chomp) (Chomp chomp)   
(Chomp chomp chomp) (Gulp!)  Not enough!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
No, the grub is of no importance. C'mon, let's get that  
Raniment. Hurry!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Why are you so motivated all of a sudden...?  
You're kinda scaring me...   
  
**Ayus:**  
But that's the way to go. Our feelings have reached  
Berserker, I'm sure!   
  
**Kama:**  
I don't think that's all there is to it.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Alright, let's get to work!   
  
**Ayus:**  
That said...our work is repairing, so there's nothing we  
can do if there are no damaged AIs.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Wishing for some to appear looks bad, so we just have  
to wait&mdash;   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Request: Appeal for rescue. A flock of malignant data  
was detected in our Repair area's outer perimeter.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
The first R-type units to encounter it sustained  
medium damage. The D-types arrived to handle the  
situation sustained minor damage.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Oh no. We should get there. Let's go!   
  
**Kama:**  
Those, right? Some of those forms we've never seen  
before...   
  
**Kama:**  
Well, my role here is the same as on the way home  
yesterday. Defeat the enemies to make people owe us.   
  
**Kama:**  
Transactional kindness. Irrefusable help.  
Forced and irreciprocal salvation...   
  
**Kama:**  
Hehehe, that could be a form of sweet pampering and  
inescapable lapse.   
  
**Kama:**  
That so happens to be my forte.   
  
**Kama:**  
Keep an eye on me, Master.   
  
**Kama:**  
Your attention could get me excited for more.   
  
**Kama:**  
Oh, and you have to praise me for a job well done,  
okay?   
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...   
  
[Battle]  
  
### Arrow 7 Pre-Battle  
  
**Sion:**  
Let's have a chat while we still can,  
Fujimaru.   
  
**Sion:**  
Don't you think it's odd?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
What is?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
About Kama over there.   
  
**Sion:**  
So long as the magical energy path between you two  
is there, she's definitely your Servant...   
  
**Sion:**  
But I still feel like something's wrong.   
  
**Sion:**  
Is it really the Kama from Chaldea back there?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...What do you mean?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
To my eternal shame, I can't quite articulate it in a  
clear manner yet.   
  
**Sion:**  
I don't have a coherent train of thought yet.  
But to put it in sensory terms&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
Her...emotional distance...? Her obedience...?  
Something's different, like the height of the wall  
between you...   
  
**Sion:**  
Something's off. Not externally, but that's not our  
usual, everyday Kama.   
  
**Sion:**  
At least I don't think she seems to be.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I wonder about that...  
  
**Sion:**  
Indeed. We don't have an answer yet, but there's  
definitely an unknown factor at play here.   
  
**Sion:**  
It looks like you don't have an answer either.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
It does kind of feel that way.  
  
**Sion:**  
I know, right? Exactly as I calculated.   
  
**Sion:**  
But it looks like you don't quite have an answer yet  
either.   
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
She's obeying orders and her abilities are up to the  
usual standards, so for now this reminder will  
suffice&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
But keep this in mind.   
  
**Sion:**  
We have to win a Holy Grail War, but our maximum  
usable warpower is an unknown variable.   
  
**Sion:**  
Adding unexpected parameters to an equation is a  
good way to screw up estimates.   
  
**Kama:**  
Hey, why are you two over there whispering all by  
yourselves? It's annoying me and I don't know why.  
(Pout)   
  
**Kama:**  
I do know why, actually. Don't you have anything to  
say about my honest work earning us Raniment!?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Great job! What a bright girl!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Thanks, Kama. I'm so glad you're here...  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
And that should do it. My role is to rush where I know  
I can find injured people,   
  
**Ayus:**  
and to provide perfect treatment.   
  
**Ayus:**  
If there's still a threat, we should contact the Defend  
AIs&mdash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Why let others take the credit? We should be making  
money off this.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Is there anyone else we can extort?   
  
**Rani-T:**  
Thank you for your continued patronage. This is a  
message service from Transfer. This comes from  
a D-type a short distance away.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
I have come to deliver a message to the nearest  
combat-capable individual.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
It says, “There is a new threat at these coordinates.  
We are under attack by something other than  
malicious data.”   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Is it a Servant...?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Couldn't say. Let's just go there for now. Give me the  
coordinates!   
  
**Rani-T:**  
Roger that. However, I would appreciate something  
for a well-performed task. (Fidgeting)   
  
**Kama:**  
So you want a tip. Fine, fine, you can have this too.   
  
**Rani-T:**  
Appreciated. It is in vogue right now.   
  
**Sion:**  
In any case, we should expect a battle when we arrive  
there. Let's get moving.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Who are these guys?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(Shadow Servants...?)  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
I'm not sure. At the very least, I don't think they're AIs.   
  
**Kama:**  
They sort of look like Servants, but I get the feeling  
they aren't.   
  
**Sion:**  
Remember what DX, the prime AI of Defend said.   
  
**Sion:**  
She warned us about “humanoid shadows of an  
aggressive nature, data unknown”.   
  
**Sion:**  
Is that what this is?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hmm? Sounds like they're up for it.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Well, whatever they are, something that attacks AI is  
our bread and butter.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Let's wrap this up so we can demand payment!   
  
### Arrow 7 Post-Battle  
  
**Kama:**  
...  
...   
  
**Kama:**  
What was that?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I couldn't see much through the black blur.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Their attacks looked familiar...  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Did they? I was killing them too fast to notice  
anything, gahaha!   
  
**Sion:**  
I want to inspect their remains. Can you help me, Ayus?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Sure, of course. Let me see, there're some around  
here...maybe here...   
  
**Kama:**  
Master, do you have a moment? I want to take this  
moment for a private conversation.   
  
**Kama:**  
Like I mentioned before...  
Are you sure that woman is Sion Eltnam?   
  
**Kama:**  
Don't you feel like she's too cold?   
  
**Kama:**  
I'm really suspecting she already knows everything  
and is just pretending to investigate stuff.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Hmm...  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
We know her appearance has changed. What's  
stopping her interior from being altered as well?   
  
**Kama:**  
We weren't close or anything, but I did see that  
woman a lot in the control room.   
  
**Kama:**  
She was always content at work, and kept a detached  
and easygoing face no matter the situation.   
  
**Kama:**  
Nonetheless, she was cold and kept an emotional  
distance between herself and the Chaldea team.   
  
**Kama:**  
A real wild card of an alchemist.   
  
**Kama:**  
I always knew she was hiding something I'd find  
personally irritating...   
  
**Kama:**  
but at the very least, I never thought she'd be such a  
straight-laced researcher.   
  
**Kama:**  
Has she laughed even once since we got here?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sion was always pretty dedicated,  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
but more like a sociable class representative.  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Yes. That's why&mdash;   
  
**Kama:**  
It's entirely possible that's someone pretending to be  
Sion Eltnam.   
  
**Kama:**  
I'd be more careful if I were you.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Hmm...  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
What are you two talking about?   
  
**Kama:**  
Oh, nothing.   
  
**Kama:**  
I was just interviewing Master to find out what kind of  
love [♂ he /♀️ she] would prefer to be corrupted by.   
  
**Kama:**  
You never know when someone will awaken to a  
special desire.   
  
**Sion:**  
So you were wasting time. Just as I calculated.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
You know... Can't you two get along better?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Just a little more affable. Am I asking too much?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Are you asking me to...interact with you two more like  
a friend?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Pretty much.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Impossible.   
  
**Sion:**  
I can't be your friend. I'm unqualified for it.   
  
**Kama:**  
...?   
  
**Sion:**  
But let us discuss something more constructive.   
  
**Sion:**  
Unfortunately, we couldn't obtain any clues from the  
remains of the shadows we fought.   
  
**Sion:**  
They seemed to be data constructs loaded with  
Raniment, so it at least helps that we could use them  
for a quick recharge.   
  
**Kama:**  
Data constructs with Raniment? Then they're&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
Correct. Among all things in this world... Servants  
would be what they're the most similar to.   
  
**Sion:**  
But they aren't Servants.   
  
**Sion:**  
Many unanswered questions. We still have a lot to  
investigate.   
  
**Kama:**  
Uh-huh. I'll leave all that to you.   
  
**Kama:**  
You seem so much more knowledgeable than me.  
About everything relevant here.   
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
O-our job here is done.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Why don't we go back?  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
We should. We don't do house calls. Most of the time,  
people go to our base for our damage repair tasks.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Like that girl Rider's Master brought to us.   
  
**Ayus:**  
But we don't have a second to waste. Should I  
message the people at the base?   
  
**Ayus:**  
It's the newly-reinforced comms' time to shine.  
Open channel, and&mdash;Hello?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
What's wrong? Our home didn't get raided again,  
did it?   
  
**Ayus:**  
N-no... That's not it.   
  
**Ayus:**  
The base is...all right. They said nothing happened.  
No damaged AI came by.   
  
**Ayus:**  
But...MANY are about to.   
  
**Ayus:**  
We got a formal request for reinforcements on that  
transmitter the Transfer girls use, even.   
  
**Ayus:**  
It says, “Large number of damaged AIs in Grow.”   
  
**Ayus:**  
“They request humane relief if possible, though they  
understand the Holy Grail War is still in effect.”   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Grow is where...  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Where Saber is, right? That'd be our first contact with  
them.   
  
**Sion:**  
Geographically speaking...   
  
**Sion:**  
They're on the opposite end of the Defend area from  
us. You could say they're the most distant area.   
  
**Sion:**  
They seem unlikely to prove an immediate threat to us...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...  
...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Grow is neighbor to...Keep. Lancer's place.)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(&mdash;Is it Lancer?)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Possible. Quite possible. Grow's materials are  
essential to cook Keep's food.)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Yeah, it can only be him. He finally made his move!)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(But wait. Time to think. Believe it or not, this might  
be&mdash;my big chance?)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Yours truly and Assassin's party of goody-two-shoes.  
Immediately after a good recharge.)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(And by my infallible prediction, the fact we were  
called to fix AIs means&mdash;)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(At the very least, they aren't too hard-pressed to do  
so. Meaning Saber hasn't lost.)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Nay, they might be still fighting right now,  
present continuous tense. Which would make our fight  
three against one...)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(That's my chance to win. Maybe my only&mdash;)   
  
**Ayus:**  
What's wrong, Berserker? You look so serious...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Serious? How could I not be?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Someone asks for our help.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Thus! Is it not our duty to answer those who wait for  
us?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Wh-what's gotten into you!?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Nothing. It's merely within yours truly's policy never  
to ignore such requests!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Aren't we racing against time? Returning to the base  
would be a bad move, positionally.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
We will rush straight to Grow! Make haste!   
  
**Kama:**  
He's definitely hiding something.   
  
**Kama:**  
Okay, so how about you go do that while we leisurely  
plant our feets here?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Blech.   
  
**Kama:**  
“Blech”?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(I don't know if it's Caster.)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(But it's quite possible he could be the one doing this.)  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
&mdash;If someone is asking for help,  
  
**Kama:**  
“We can't ignore it.”   
  
**Kama:**  
(Sigh) I knew you would say that.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I won't ignore it.  
  
**Kama:**  
(Sigh) I knew you would say that.   
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
All according to my calculations.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hoh. E-excellent, I wouldn't have partnered with you  
otherwise. Your pluck is admirable!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You have my greatest praise. Distinguished indeed!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(He's quite the unsubtle individual.)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(But his personality is impossible to hate.)  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
With that decided, let us go. It's do-or-die. Stay on  
your guard.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
We shall...win. We must...!   
  
## Section 5: Locked Room Taboo/do not enter.  
  
### Arrow 1  
  
**???:**  
Hehehe, we did it!  
Another fine batch of material!   
  
**A：Grow AI:**  
...Woohoo. Clap clap clap.   
  
**A：Grow AI:**  
...There it is, the prime AI's smug smile.   
  
**A：Grow AI:**  
...Not that I mind, but wow.   
  
**A：Grow AI:**  
...The prime AI really loves her job.   
  
**A：Grow AI:**  
...High-quality products make you want to show off.  
I get her...   
  
**B：Grow AI:**  
I also feel proud watching our crops grow...   
  
**B：Grow AI:**  
(Stare)   
  
**???:**  
I wanna show them to Saber... Does anyone know  
where she is?   
  
**Grow AI:**  
I believe she's patrolling.   
  
**???:**  
I see. She's always so diligent about work.   
  
**???:**  
I knows she's doing it to protect our area, but I do  
wish she'd interact with everyone more.   
  
**???:**  
With me too, of course. I only get one Servant and she  
only gets one Master.   
  
**Grow AI:**  
...Ah. Saber's returned.   
  
**Saber:**  
...  
...   
  
**Saber's Master:**  
Oh, welcome back, Saber. Anything out of the  
ordinary?   
  
**Saber:**  
Nothing in particular.   
  
**Saber:**  
...Sakura. I have something to tell you.   
  
**Saber's Master:**  
Sakura... Oh right, that was my name.   
  
**G：Sakura:**  
Sorry for forgetting the name you so kindly gave me in  
association with this design's pink colors.   
  
**G：Sakura:**  
As an AI, names are a new concept...  
Um, what is it?   
  
**Saber:**  
It's nothing important.   
  
**Saber:**  
I just want to warn you that I won't be too surprised,   
  
**Saber:**  
because the material you're hiding behind your back is  
sticking out a lot.   
  
**Saber:**  
How many times have you tried this? I can't provide  
you with the reaction you want.   
  
**Saber:**  
So stop wasting your time.   
  
**G：Sakura:**  
Okay... Sorry about that.   
  
**Saber:**  
I'm just here for my regular report. I'll be returning  
to&mdash;   
  
**G：Sakura:**  
Wait. This is one of those new processed materials  
that came from Keep... Aren't they unusual?   
  
**G：Sakura:**  
I believe they're produced with a formula closer to  
cooking. This could be like a bread or a naan.   
  
**G：Sakura:**  
They have some Raniment, so they wouldn't be  
wasted on you, Saber.   
  
**G：Sakura:**  
Can you at least replenish yourself before leaving?  
I already finished my share.   
  
**Saber:**  
...Fine.   
  
**G：Sakura:**  
Hehe. It's so fascinating to see the materials we  
created being turned into this.   
  
**G：Sakura:**  
I'd love to learn how to do it, but I suppose I can't  
since that's Keep's exclusive job...   
  
**Saber:**  
I'm done eating. I'll be leaving now.   
  
**G：Sakura:**  
Oh, already?   
  
**G：Sakura:**  
All right...bye then.   
  
**J：Saber:**  
Sakura. I know how much you care about the Grow  
area.   
  
**J：Saber:**  
I know how dearly you wish to maintain your home  
and your job.   
  
**J：Saber:**  
That's why I'm operating like this.   
  
**J：Saber:**  
I'll give everything to make your wish come true.  
As your Servant.   
  
**J：Saber:**  
Not as your friend.   
  
**J：Saber:**  
Our apparent age may be close, but we both know it  
doesn't reflect reality. I don't see any point to  
thoughtless intimacy.   
  
**H：Sakura:**  
...  
...   
  
**H：Sakura:**  
O-okay. I see your point... I should have figured...   
  
**J：Saber:**  
I'm going. Keep to your job, Sakura.   
  
**H：Sakura:**  
Back to work it is.   
  
**H：Sakura:**  
This next batch looks like it will yield huge returns,  
so I can't let this one fumble.   
  
**Sakura:**  
&mdash;Heya!   
  
**A：Grow AI:**  
...Ooooh, that savage pose...the symbol of the leader's  
motivation...   
  
**A：Grow AI:**  
...The legendary “heya” we only hear in the peaks of  
her mood.   
  
**A：Grow AI:**  
...I haven't witnessed this in a long time. Something  
great will happen today...   
  
**Sakura:**  
D-don't be weird about it. I'm just feeling motivated,  
okay?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Though I can see how you could get addicted to  
watching this...   
  
**Saber:**  
(This is how things should be...)   
  
**Saber:**  
(I can't put my finger on exactly why,)   
  
**Saber:**  
(but I can sense that I must not interact with her.  
That's for certain.)   
  
**Saber:**  
(So, that's how things should be&mdash;)   
  
**Saber:**  
...Tch!?   
  
**Lancer:**  
Woah there.   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
What now? Didn't I tell you she'd be here...?   
  
**Saber:**  
A Servant and Master...!   
  
**Lancer:**  
Yup. I'm Lancer. Sorry 'bout the sudden visit.   
  
**Lancer:**  
And you... I see a sword in your hand, so Saber?  
Pretty small one, though.   
  
**Saber:**  
Are you trying to say a small sword can't kill?  
&mdash;Do you want to put that to the test?   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
(This won't go over well. Stop, Lancer. You'll lose.  
That's the inevitable outcome from having me around.)   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
(I'm...a useless sinner who deserves to lose.  
There's no avoiding my punishment &mdash;)   
  
**Lancer:**  
...Just kiddin'.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Don't worry.  I do have my weapon with me,  
but I ain't here for a bout.   
  
**Lancer:**  
And your Master ain't even here.   
  
**Saber:**  
&mdash;Pardon?   
  
**Saber:**  
What are you talking about? Aren't you a Servant in  
this Holy Grail War?   
  
**Lancer:**  
Sure am. You're right about that, but I got something  
more important to do.   
  
**Lancer:**  
You can't fight a war on an empty stomach.  
Food first, fighting second. Food above all.   
  
**Lancer:**  
I can't fight before I give my Master the delicious meal  
that'll make her happy.   
  
**Lancer:**  
That's why I've come to procure ingredients here in  
Grow!   
  
**Lancer:**  
I'm not here for a fight. So put that sword of yours  
down, Saber.   
  
**Saber:**  
Are you stupid? Who would believe that?   
  
**Lancer:**  
Well, I kinda need you to... Okay, here's a fair  
compromise.   
  
**Saber:**  
What are you sitting on the ground for?   
  
**L：Lancer:**  
Saber, you may call your Master here.   
  
**L：Lancer:**  
I'm not lying. If you let me have a sincere conversation  
with your Master, that will convey my honesty to you  
too.   
  
**Saber:**  
That confirms it, just an idiot&mdash;  
...!   
  
**Saber:**  
(Right, there could be another group working off this!  
While he distracts me here... Sakura!)   
  
**Lancer:**  
What's up?   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
She said no. Let's leave...   
  
**Saber:**  
Sakura!   
  
**Sakura:**  
Wh-what's wrong? I've never seen you make a face  
like that...   
  
**Saber:**  
&mdash;You're not hurt.   
  
**Saber:**  
I was worried for nothing... No, it may just be that I got  
here faster than them.   
  
**Saber:**  
There's an enemy here. We need to move, just in  
case&mdash;   
  
**L：Lancer:**  
Hup hup. Cutting in!   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
Don't leave me behind, you idiot...!   
  
**Saber:**  
Lancer!   
  
**Saber:**  
(He seems to have followed me here. I returned at full  
speed. He's as fast as me...!?)   
  
**Lancer:**  
What's with that look in your eyes?   
  
**Lancer:**  
Oh, uh, see, I'm a bit blessed by the winds.  
Just 'cause I'm big, it doesn't mean I'm slow.   
  
**Saber:**  
...  
...   
  
**Saber:**  
You used me to locate my Master?   
  
**Lancer:**  
Nah, you just ran here without saying a word.   
  
**Lancer:**  
I told you to bring your Master to me, but I never said  
I'd be staying put,   
  
**Lancer:**  
so when you ran, I assumed you were leading me to  
her and followed.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Eh, not that any of that matters.  
Yo, are you Saber's Master?   
  
**Sakura:**  
I...am.   
  
**Saber:**  
You don't need to answer. Back away, Sakura.   
  
**Lancer:**  
I already told you enough times before, I'm not here  
for a fight.   
  
**Lancer:**  
I'm a cook. And the ingredients necessary to cook in  
this world are your material.   
  
**Lancer:**  
So I'm here to procure some. Here's where the crops  
grow, so I suppose I can find some quality goods  
around these parts, right?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Cook...ing? So you're the one behind the new trend?   
  
**Lancer:**  
Hell yeah, you ate some? Was it good?   
  
**A：Grow AI:**  
Delicious. Just remembering it... I feel like I'm living a  
dream...   
  
**Lancer:**  
Hahaha, really now? Glad to know my cooking works  
even on AI!   
  
**Lancer:**  
But my gloomball of a Master still isn't satisfied with  
my quality, see?   
  
**Lancer:**  
The ultimate dish starts with the ultimate ingredients.  
And that's what I'm here for.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I see...   
  
**Saber:**  
Are you really believing his words?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Yeah. I don't think that's the story someone wanting  
to trick me would go for.   
  
**Sakura:**  
And if he was planning to fight, he would have  
attacked before we linked up.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Not to mention&mdash;   
  
**Sakura:**  
Not to mention this really great smell. Don't you think?   
  
**Saber:**  
I...suppose.   
  
**Sakura:**  
So I think it's pretty safe to say Lancer is indeed a  
cook.   
  
**Sakura:**  
As the prime Grow AI,   
  
**Sakura:**  
it's my natural duty to provide materials to the  
children of Keep who will put it to good use.   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
It's not me asking for this donation, though...   
  
**Sakura:**  
Besides, didn't I mention before that I'd like to learn  
how to cook?   
  
**Sakura:**  
I have so many questions. So can you take him at his  
word, Saber?   
  
**Saber:**  
...  
...   
  
**Saber:**  
I thought you were more timid, but you're quite  
stubborn and stupid.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Don't say stupid. That's so mean.   
  
**Saber:**  
I won't allow anyone acting out of hand. One false  
move and I'll kill you.   
  
**Saber:**  
&mdash;This applies to everyone here. I'll even kill your  
Master.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Oh, I'm fine with that!   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
Well, I'm not!   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
I mean... I feel like if anyone's going to die,  
I'll be the first one anyway, but...   
  
**Lancer:**  
No, no, what I'm fine with is the way it sounds like  
they'll hand us the ingredients.   
  
**Lancer:**  
There's no way you'd die. I'm here to protect you.  
You're totally safe from death.   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
...  
...   
  
**Lancer:**  
Alright, the wind is blowing in a nice direction!   
  
**Lancer:**  
So let's waste no time. Show me the best produce you  
have!   
  
**Sakura:**  
Come to think of it, this might be the first time  
someone actively demanded quality.   
  
**Sakura:**  
This gets me in the mood to show off a product  
worthy of my prime AI status.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Heya!   
  
**Sakura:**  
I still don't know what you consider “best”,   
  
**Sakura:**  
so let's take a look at the stock together.   
  
**Sakura:**  
We should be able to find the highest grade materials  
that haven't been shipped yet.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Oh, really? Thanks a bunch!   
  
**Lancer:**  
Hoh, you do have a lot. Don't mind if I test a few.   
  
**Lancer:**  
There is some stuff I've never seen before,   
  
**Lancer:**  
but a good cook knows how to predict how good  
something ultimately will be.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Lemme see...   
  
**Sakura:**  
I'm really proud of those materials over there in  
particular. What do you think? Do they satisfy you?   
  
**Saber:**  
He's clearly digging through things at random.   
  
**Saber:**  
He could be aiming to mishandle material to lower its  
value. How much slack are we going to give?   
  
**Saber:**  
Ugh, he's smelling them. We need to stop him before  
he starts licking or biting things.   
  
**Saber:**  
Shouldn't we kill him before he does?   
  
**Sakura:**  
C-calm down.   
  
**Sakura:**  
He'll just have to pay for anything he does lick or bite...   
  
**Sakura:**  
But he wouldn't do it for more than one item per  
batch. And what can we do if that's what he needs to  
evaluate the product?   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
(Ugh. Can this end any faster...?)   
  
**Sakura:**  
...  
...   
  
**Sakura:**  
Hello... Lancer's Master... You're the prime Keep AI,  
right?   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
Probably.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Probably?   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
My personality was randomly plastered over an AI.   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
This must have caused some sort of weird bug.  
I don't feel any sense of duty as an AI.   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
My memories show me being dutiful, but now my  
responsible side is tangibly gone.   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
(Not only that... I'm definitely failing as a Grail War  
Master too...)   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
Heh... What's going on with me?   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
Seeing how well you're doing, it makes it all the more  
clear to me.   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
I can't pretend not to notice it anymore. Not that I  
ever really tried to.   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
I'm probably glitching, both as an AI and as a Master.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Are...you? You don't seem that way.   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
I am.   
  
**Sakura:**  
But, uh...   
  
**Sakura:**  
Oh. There was something I wanted to ask you but  
forgot.   
  
**Sakura:**  
What's your name?   
  
**Sakura:**  
I'm called Sakura. It was Saber who named me.   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
I have no name&mdash;   
  
**Lancer:**  
She's got one!   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
Lancer!   
  
**Lancer:**  
Didn't you say yourself you felt like that was your  
name? Names are important. If you have one,  
you shouldn't hide it.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Mmm, I can do some good stuff with this! Its smell is...  
Well, now...   
  
**Lancer's Master:**  
...Cerejeira.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Cerejeira? That's a beautiful name.   
  
**M：Cerejeira:**  
I don't care.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Hehehe. By the way, did you ever eat those meals,  
Cerejeira?   
  
**Sakura:**  
They're quite delicious. Lancer made them, right?   
  
**Sakura:**  
They've also got me dying to get him to teach me how  
to cook.   
  
**M：Cerejeira:**  
Go ahead. He's...a weird Servant.   
  
**M：Cerejeira:**  
He spends all his time cooking for me, not fighting or  
preparing for battle.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Oh. Hehehe, you're a shy one.   
  
**Sakura:**  
To me, you mentioning how you get to eat his meals  
all the time sounds like you're bragging about your man.   
  
**Sakura:**  
But my Saber is a great Servant too.   
  
**Sakura:**  
She's usually brusque, but she's actually very kind.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Whenever I'm doing any remotely dangerous job,  
she's always watching me from behind in silence  
and&mdash;   
  
**Saber:**  
Sakura.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Hehehe...I'm saying too much, aren't I?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Sorry, I'm usually not this talkative.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Most of us G-types don't get to talk much, but now I  
suddenly find myself enjoying chatting quite a lot.   
  
**M：Cerejeira:**  
That's weird...   
  
**M：Cerejeira:**  
You call it chatting... Are you forgetting I'm an enemy  
Master? You shouldn't be treating me like a friend.   
  
**Sakura:**  
We AI were pure functionality, but now that we've  
been added this extra element that is our pseudo-  
personalities,   
  
**Sakura:**  
everyone will have a part of themselves that feels odd  
or glitchy, I think.   
  
**Sakura:**  
That's pretty much why I wanted to chat with you  
despite you being an enemy Master.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Our competition doesn't change this. Right,  
and beyond that...   
  
**Sakura:**  
There's no reason why&mdash;rivals can't be friends.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Or is that a problem for you?   
  
**M：Cerejeira:**  
I... I'm...   
  
**M：Cerejeira:**  
I don't think I deserve any of this.   
  
**M：Cerejeira:**  
I'm not qualified to be prime AI, or a Master,  
or someone's friend.   
  
**M：Cerejeira:**  
I'm not qualified to be anything. Considering all I've  
done before&mdash;   
  
**Sakura:**  
Done before? Your phrasing makes no sense.   
  
**Sakura:**  
We're Masters birthed by the randomizer. This is the  
first place we've ever been to.   
  
**Sakura:**  
You may have messed up before when you were just  
an AI, but why would that matter now?   
  
**M：Cerejeira:**  
Do you...think so?   
  
**Sakura:**  
I'm sure. So I don't think you need to mind it.   
  
**M：Cerejeira:**  
You're weird...   
  
**Lancer:**  
Yup, that's the stuff! That's some good material.  
Perfect size and perfect luster.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Yeah, I'll take the whole lot!   
  
**Lancer:**  
Ah. Sorry, am I interrupting something?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
N-not at all.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Yeah, we were just chatting. We had a very meaningful  
time together.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Great to hear. So, I gotta pay in Raniment, right?   
  
**Lancer:**  
There you go.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Oh my, this much? I don't think this trade is fair on  
you...   
  
**Lancer:**  
No biggie, it's 'cause I dropped in with no previous  
warning. I included a fee for being unreasonable.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Thank you very much for that.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I don't need this much, so that's all yours, Saber.   
  
**Saber:**  
...Are you alright in the head, Lancer? You're  
benefiting your enemy.   
  
**Saber:**  
Are you trying to say you can defeat me even with a  
handicap?   
  
**Lancer:**  
Man, you're really raring for this fight, huh?  
I already told you I'm not duking it out with anyone for  
now.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Now's the time for cooking. Gotta do something 'bout  
my Master's sulking face.   
  
**Saber:**  
How long do you mean by “for now”?   
  
**Saber:**  
Nothing changes the fact that we're participants in  
the Holy Grail War. Combat is unavoidable, I believe.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Like I care.   
  
**Lancer:**  
I'm pretty sure everyone wants a little more time to  
settle in. Not just you and me.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Just give all of us a moment to eat what we want,  
and once everyone is full,   
  
**Lancer:**  
and out of other things to do&mdash;   
  
**Lancer:**  
That's when should gather for our little tournament.  
Have it as an exercise to help digestion, don't you  
agree?   
  
**Saber:**  
...  
...   
  
**Lancer:**  
And that's all I had to say, so I'm out. Gotta make a  
supreme dish with these ingredients.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Heheheh, just wait for it, Master. Your next meal will  
be the one that finally breaks you out of your shell...!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Don't expect any excitement from me.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Well then, uh... Goodbye.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I had so many questions I wanted to ask about  
cooking, but it's hard to find the courage to ask Lancer...   
  
**Saber:**  
It was the right choice. I'd do everything to stop you if  
you tried asking him.   
  
**Saber:**  
I'd like to ask you never to try anything like that again.   
  
**Saber:**  
From my perspective as someone who needs to  
protect my Master in the Holy Grail War, what  
happened just now was far too dangerous.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Was it...?   
  
**Saber:**  
Don't you tell me you already developed trust and  
think of them as friends now?   
  
**Saber:**  
If so, you're insanely naive.   
  
**Sakura:**  
This area is what I love and what matters the most for  
me.   
  
**Sakura:**  
So I kinda...can't be harsh on people who value Grow  
and praise the quality of my materials.   
  
**Saber:**  
You need to change the way you think.   
  
**Saber:**  
Those are the only Holy Grail War participants we've  
met so far. There's no guarantee the others will be like  
them.   
  
**Saber:**  
We're lucky that no one was harmed in the present  
incident. If it happens again, who can tell what&mdash;   
  
**Sakura:**  
Wh-what?   
  
**Sakura:**  
&mdash;Team! Tell me what happened!   
  
**D：Rani-G:**  
Oh no...   
  
**E：Rani-G:**  
We're under attack.   
  
**F：Rani-G:**  
It's...a Servant!   
  
### Arrow 2 Pre-Battle  
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Stand in line.   
  
**D：Build AI (Rani-B):**  
...Complete.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Hold your tongue. You're not a person, you're an  
object. Obey me in silence.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
I don't want to even hear a “yes” from you.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
I have no hesitation. Therefore I don't want to see any  
hesitation from you.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
My orders are law. That's the number one rule,  
and if you follow it, things will go along smoothly.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
AI led by a competent manager wasting nothing.  
That's the ideal.   
  
**D：Rani-B:**  
...  
...   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Okay, the new and improved programming is working.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Utilizing my prime AI authority, I remove the  
restrictions... Maximize the numbers&mdash;ignore the  
safety mechanisms.   
  
**E：Rani-B:**  
Uh...ah...!   
  
**D：Rani-B:**  
Hhh...ah&mdash;.   
  
**Caster:**  
Oh, what a comforting sound.  
That is the melody the room demands...   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
...  
...   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
The forced Raniment transfer program is functioning.  
I have no complaints about its quantity, transfer speed,  
or safety.   
  
**Caster:**  
Excellent news.   
  
**Caster:**  
However...there is still one faulty aspect.   
  
**Caster:**  
There were some who sang their turn in reply to their  
lord's commands, no!?   
  
**Caster:**  
Didn't you, their lord, demand no unnecessary words?  
Why can't those dullards follow something so simple?   
  
**E：Rani-B:**  
Uh...ah...   
  
**B：Caster:**  
No one is allowed to sing out of turn just because they  
can sometimes luck out and produce a nice melody.   
  
**B：Caster:**  
Right, Master?   
  
**B：Caster:**  
In that case, alas, I'm obliged to mete out punishment.   
  
**B：Caster:**  
That is just logic. That is just providence!   
  
**B：Caster:**  
We can manufacture as many replacements as  
necessary. Go, go, go!   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
...  
...   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
&mdash;You're right. I'll narrow down the sampling  
further.   
  
**F：Rani-B:**  
...  
...   
  
**Caster:**  
HAHAHA, HAHAHAHA! Did you hear that?  
Understand its meaning.   
  
**Caster:**  
You must follow what he says. Your owner's  
commands are absolute!   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Exactly... No one can disobey me.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Because I'm in charge here.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
And it's the duty of the superior to stand above others.  
That's the ideal. That's why I operate the way I do.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
For that, I'll choose the most logical means and take  
the most efficient path to victory&mdash;   
  
**Caster:**  
Yes, you're doing nothing wrong. Those with power  
dominate those without. That is the natural order.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Therefore, I must rule this world.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
I must win this Holy Grail War and become the new  
general supervisor AI.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
That's the happiest outcome this world could have.  
That will make all AI happy...   
  
**F：Rani-B:**  
...  
...   
  
**Caster:**  
What a lonesome silence. But I like this look on your  
faces.   
  
**Caster:**  
Panic, agony, fear, bewilderment. And yet,  
the thoughtless will to dedicate oneself to their job.   
  
**Caster:**  
Such is the functionality of man-made dolls.  
It's for such reasons they find themselves unable to  
escape any cruelty.   
  
**Caster:**  
Alas, it's a curse. This is exactly like a curse!   
  
**Caster:**  
Dance, pantomimes. I shall be watching you from the  
room fragrant of life&mdash;   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
...  
...   
  
**Caster:**  
Well then&mdash;I am refilled. Can you see the route  
that will make you king of the world?   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Of course. We eat the easier prey first.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Leave the team-up cowards for later. We'll target the  
adjacent area opposite us next.   
  
**Caster:**  
That's Grow... Saber's territory.   
  
**Caster:**  
Due to how distant they are from Berserker's Repair,  
I don't see them joining forces.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Hmph. Don't worry yourself with the opposing side.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Once I'm done with my adjustments, the trump card  
we discussed will be available to us. We can just use it if  
the time comes.   
  
**Caster:**  
True.   
  
**Caster:**  
Yes, I look forward to it. To see that thing overflow  
from the secret room...   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Then get moving, Caster.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
The day I become king of the world is nigh.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
And then I—head of the house of Makiri—will reach the  
Root by my own merits!   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Yes, all evil I commit&mdash;is to reach the ideal!  
Haha, hyahahahaha, hahahahahahaha!   
  
**Caster:**  
(Head of the house of Makiri. Words my Master  
repeats often, but what do they mean?)   
  
**Caster:**  
(It's probably an unconscious expression with  
implications Master doesn't realize.)   
  
**Caster:**  
(Where could this personality of Master have come  
from&mdash;?)   
  
**Caster:**  
(I suppose the same question applies to me...  
Regardless, all that those of us here must do is fulfill  
our parts as pawns in the Holy Grail War.)   
  
**Caster:**  
All is equal. Every living thing is a pawn to god,  
a pawn to the narrative.   
  
**Caster:**  
We are merely to unleash the desires granted within  
to live in pleasure until we reach our deaths.   
  
**Caster:**  
Let us go devour some screams of agony.   
  
**Caster:**  
To indulge in debauchery, as I did in my  
chamber&mdash;   
  
**G：Rani-G:**  
...I'm...damaged.   
  
**H：Rani-G:**  
Must...run...away...   
  
**Sakura:**  
Ah... Girls...!   
  
**Saber:**  
Don't stop running, Sakura!  
Where are there fewest enemies!?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Considering the communication density of the AIs...  
Probably field N34...?   
  
**Saber:**  
Then let's fall back to it!   
  
**Saber:**  
I can defeat them one by one, but they're way too  
numerous here...!   
  
**Sakura:**  
Y-yeah, I can't...   
  
**Saber:**  
Hey! Pull yourself together!   
  
**Sakura:**  
Sorry, I just tripped over my feet. I'm fine...   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Look what we have here. I didn't think AI could make  
a hobby out of licking the ground.   
  
**Saber:**  
Name yourself, fiend!   
  
**Caster:**  
Caster. Pleased to make your acquaintance.   
  
**Caster:**  
&mdash;I'm feeding my pets at the moment.  
Rude as it may be, I must ask you to excuse me.   
  
**Caster:**  
Dig in.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Ah, AH... Please, stop, make them stop!   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
I can't. It'd be illogical to allow leftovers from such a  
delicious meal to remain.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Hmph. First Berserker, and now this... Only the best  
magi were supposed to become Masters.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
So why are there so many dullards failing to grasp  
basic laws?   
  
**Sakura:**  
This...this is unwarranted, even for the Holy Grail War.   
  
**Sakura:**  
These girls are the crux of our operation.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Not only for the Grow sector. They're a cornerstone  
allowing this world to be what it is.   
  
**Sakura:**  
You won't be able to recover from this. It'll generate  
all sorts of distortions until everything stops functioning...!   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Ridiculous. Just recreate the AIs. All I'm doing is just  
temporarily lowering their numbers.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
I don't need any of these materials to win anyways.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Indeed, once I'm the supervisor AI, I'll fully automate  
this sector.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
It's only right to minimize wasted resources.   
  
**Sakura:**  
No. That's wrong. This can't...   
  
**Sakura:**  
Please understand.   
  
**Sakura:**  
You don't know how proud we are of our work.  
How earnestly we try to fulfill our role...!   
  
**Sakura:**  
I'm sure Build is no different in that regard...   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
I don't care. I'm not like the inferior AIs. What's  
unnecessary is unnecessary, and that's all.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I don't hold my life in that high regard. You can do  
whatever you want with me.   
  
**Sakura:**  
But whatever you do, don't destroy the Grow area.   
  
**Sakura:**  
If it's a fight you want, then I'll fight you.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Sure, that's what I'm here for. Although&mdash;   
  
**Caster:**  
Although I don't intend to stop my banquet.  
My pets' stomachs are as my own.   
  
**Caster:**  
If you plan to do nothing about it, I'll eat these rations  
until my plate is clean.   
  
**Sakura:**  
No...!   
  
**Saber:**  
Give up. Talking is useless. These guys are intent on  
crushing Grow no matter what you say to them.   
  
**Saber:**  
We have to fight.   
  
**Saber:**  
(She's still not mentally stable&mdash;there's no  
guarantee she can smoothly transfer magical energy.)   
  
**Saber:**  
(It's better to assume I can't use my Noble Phantasm.  
I can't let her waste the Command Spell here either...)   
  
**Saber:**  
(And to top it off, I have to worry about the AIs and  
buildings around me. I'm not getting a lot of freedom on  
how I fight.)   
  
**Saber:**  
(But I gotta fight with the hand I'm dealt. I can't let  
Sakura's end come about like this&mdash;!)   
  
### Arrow 2 Post-Battle  
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Heh. Those Mystic Eyes of Petrification and the  
barely visible shapes of those monsters in their light...   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Medusa, surely?   
  
**Saber:**  
I'll leave that up to your imagination...   
  
**Saber:**  
(I am defeating the familiars, but they're far too  
numerous...!)   
  
**Saber:**  
(There's no other choice, we have to escape.  
Even if it means abandoning Grow&mdash;)   
  
**Sakura:**  
No. Don't do it, Saber, please. That would defeat the  
point...   
  
**Saber:**  
...   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Batteries low? I see you can't use your Mystic Eyes  
continuously.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
At the very least, they don't seem potent enough to  
instantly petrify me from this distance...   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Well, even if the effect could reach me, it's obvious I'm  
superior enough to resist it.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
My plan of action remains the same. Keep this  
distance while I flatten you with numbers&mdash;   
  
**Saber:**  
Sakura...!   
  
**Sakura:**  
I'm...sorry. But...it's...fine...   
  
**Saber:**  
It's not fine...!   
  
**Caster:**  
I shall deliver the coup de grâce.   
  
**Caster:**  
I'll gouge those sinful eyes of yours. Those eyes that  
saw what they should have not.   
  
**Caster:**  
And then, heheh, I'll hear your screams of remorse,  
my beautiful bride&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Stop right there!  
  
---  
  
### Arrow 3 Pre-Battle  
  
**Ayus:**  
I'm Ayus, prime AI of Repair. I've received your  
emergency support request!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Even during the Holy Grail War, it's our duty to treat  
injured AI.   
  
**Ayus:**  
We could never ignore a formal request!   
  
**Sakura:**  
Ah... I didn't think you'd come. I'm so glad...   
  
**Saber:**  
Sakura? Did you call them?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Yes, a T-type girl happened to be nearby. I had to tell  
her to escape, so I took the chance to make a relief  
request.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Grow sent Repair an emergency code meant for  
disasters.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I didn't know if they'd come, but I thought it was  
better than doing nothing.   
  
**Saber:**  
Sounds as naive of a move as asking robbers to put  
out a fire.   
  
**Saber:**  
Yet, somehow... They seem willing to help.   
  
**Kama:**  
Ugh. That Caster again. Does he have no shame in  
repeating this tired tirade?   
  
**Kama:**  
Doesn't even look like he knows what shame is,  
actually.   
  
**Sion:**  
I see Repair is not the only place falling victim to his  
gluttony.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
What? Caster? I was so sure it'd be...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I missed the mark. Can we go home?   
  
**Ayus:**  
No!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I can't let him escape...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
After all the horrible things he did to the AIs...!  
  
---  
  
**Caster's Master:**  
You again!? What's your problem?   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
You're always, always getting in my way!   
  
**Kama:**  
Don't you have yourself to blame for always,  
always working on something stupid?   
  
**Kama:**  
So, planning to escape pathetically again like the  
small fry you are?   
  
**Kama:**  
You're so adorably worthless. This is getting me  
worked up.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Shut up! I'm too competent to be bothered with you  
worms!   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Fine, I'll take you on. My competent methods surely  
gathered more resources than you have, and will let me  
use them more efficiently too!   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Ergo, I have no chance of losing!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hah, he's having an ego trip.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Fine by me, it was a long way for us to get here.  
Going home now would make it a huge waste of my  
time.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Let's squash Caster while we got the chance and  
make all of Grow owe us one!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(I don't how I'll do it, but if I can get Saber on our side  
during the turmoil, that'd be a big profit...!)   
  
**Saber:**  
Honestly, I'm almost out of gas. If you wanna fight him,  
that's entirely up to you.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
You're...  
  
**Sion:**  
You're different in Class, appearance, and personality  
to the one we know,   
  
**Sion:**  
but are you the youngest Gorgon sister... Medusa?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Medusa...?  
  
---  
  
**Saber:**  
You also figured it out? But I didn't even show you my  
Mystic Eyes.   
  
**Saber:**  
Well, it's not like I could hide my True Name for long.  
Correct, I'm Medusa.   
  
**D：Medusa:**  
But it's not me that you should be focusing on.   
  
**D：Medusa:**  
Also&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
I hadn't noticed until now, but wow, you're really  
injured! Oh no. Give me a moment, I'll come heal you!   
  
**Sakura:**  
I'm Saber's Master, though...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Oh, are you?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Sure, this raises a lot of questions about what attitude  
is expected of me, but this specific case was a formal  
request to my partition.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I won't sweat the complicated details! Lie down and  
let me heal you!   
  
**Sakura:**  
Thank...you...   
  
**D：Medusa:**  
My remaining power will be used only to protect my  
Master.   
  
**D：Medusa:**  
Since Repair's Master is healing her, she'll be  
protected too.   
  
**D：Medusa:**  
You handle the attack.   
  
**D：Medusa:**  
You can't hope to earn my trust, but since you came to  
help, I expect at least some results from you.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Saber, please...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Quiet! No talking.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Oh, sorry...   
  
**Caster:**  
Oho? Assassin. Since last I saw you, you've grown into  
the beautiful age of a bride.   
  
**Kama:**  
Wrong about the bride part, but perfectly right about  
the beautiful. Ever felt like suffering corruption?   
  
**Caster:**  
Kehehe, hahaha! In that case, you're more than  
qualified! Become the bride that will entertain me.   
  
**Caster:**  
&mdash;I'll give you a full explanation. Nonetheless,  
the key will be in your hands. That is the trap which  
tests love and loyalty.   
  
**Caster:**  
You of terrifying disposition! The taboo which mustn't  
be seen shall now overflow from my secret room...!   
  
### Arrow 3 Post-Battle  
  
**Ayus:**  
Phew... How's that?   
  
**Sakura:**  
I think I'm fine. Thank you, you've been a huge help.   
  
**Sakura:**  
...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ah, don't force yourself just yet!   
  
**Ayus:**  
All I really did is was connect together to important  
parts to prevent you from ceasing activity. It's honestly  
all first-aid stuff.   
  
**Ayus:**  
And I can only access the AI portions. The Master  
parts is off-limits&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
There's a real chance you could suffer after-effects.   
  
**Ayus:**  
If possible, I'd like to examine you more later when  
things are calm...   
  
**Sakura:**  
&mdash;No. If I can get back to work, that's all I need.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Prioritize the other injured AIs over me. Please.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I object to this “work is all I need” policy, but I can't  
argue in this situation. Got it.   
  
**Ayus:**  
But do come visit my place if you have the time!  
Checkups are important!   
  
**Medusa:**  
You're safe, aren't you, Sakura?   
  
**Medusa:**  
That's a relief...   
  
**Sakura:**  
Yeah, thanks to her. How are things on your end,  
Saber?   
  
**Medusa:**  
They can do only the bare minimum. I'm not  
particularly happy with their work.   
  
**Caster:**  
Gh, oh...!   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Why!? I'm absolutely sure we accumulated more  
power!   
  
**Kama:**  
Sure, I can't argue you have the upper hand in terms of  
resource quantity.   
  
**Kama:**  
But it's ultimately a matter of how you use what you  
have. You have to know when to spend and when to  
save. You have no idea how much can be solved by  
knowing the right tricks.   
  
**Kama:**  
No matter how much cannon fodder you keep making  
with your leaking funds, all you accomplish with it is  
being a nuisance.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
A first-class warrior must be cost-efficient.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Needless to say, yours truly is a first-class warrior.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...Hey, who was the truth-teller saying I'm a first-class  
slacker?   
  
**Caster:**  
I suppose I overindulged myself in the battle against  
Saber. Having too many gorgeous wives is not without  
its demerits...   
  
**Sion:**  
&mdash;I figured it out.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sion?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Figured what out?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Something always felt off about him, but seeing his  
full fighting prowess just now confirmed my suspicions.   
  
**Sion:**  
He's not Gilles de Rais.   
  
**Kama:**  
What? But...   
  
**Sion:**  
We happened to be sorely mistaken from how his  
looks and the theme of his familiars coincided.   
  
**Sion:**  
His behavior is not one of a marshal of France.  
He's fixated solely on the grotesque screams of  
beautiful women.   
  
**Kama:**  
Isn't that just his form of love? That's clearly how it  
was in his Caster form.   
  
**Sion:**  
Consider also the keywords “bride”, “room”, and “key”.  
Those are very helpful in narrowing down his  
definition.   
  
**Sion:**  
A pure evil serial killer who has a magic key,  
a secret room, and kills the brides who see what's  
inside.   
  
**Sion:**  
I know one figure who fits the description. Although I  
didn't keep conscious records of it,   
  
**Sion:**  
I just found it again when searching within the few  
dozen kilobytes of data I have available.   
  
**Sion:**  
Do you know who I'm talking about,  
Fujimaru?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Do you mean&mdash;  
  
**Sion:**  
Yes.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
...?  
  
**Sion:**  
He is famous enough that you could know him by  
name but not know the contents of his story.   
  
**Sion:**  
This should ring a bell to you.   
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
&mdash;Bluebeard.   
  
**Sion:**  
The titular monster of a story written by the 17th  
century poet Perrault. A fictional character modelled  
after Marshal De Rais.   
  
**Sion:**  
That's most likely the True Name of the Caster in  
front of us.   
  
**Kama:**  
For real?   
  
**Sion:**  
One question is enough to prove it.   
  
**Sion:**  
Caster...   
  
**Sion:**  
How do you feel about Jeanne d'Arc?   
  
**Caster:**  
Who?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
&mdash;All according to my calculations.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's evident that their Saint Graph structures are  
similar. They have shared elements, more technically  
speaking.   
  
**Sion:**  
Which is how his familiars got interlaced with the  
taboo room.   
  
**Sion:**  
I conjecture his Noble Phantasm is the magic key that  
opens the room overflowing with dreadful monsters.   
  
**Sion:**  
In other words...   
  
**Sion:**  
He is a sort of Alter Ego. The Bluebeard portions of  
Gilles de Rais separated from the whole&mdash;   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Shut up, shut up, cease your chirping!  
Learning his True Name changes nothing!   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
I'm very competent! Too competent to lose and too  
competent to be allowed to lose!   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Time for the trump card. Use the trump card, Caster!   
  
**Caster:**  
Oh, oooooooooh. Are you sure, Master? That  
would&mdash;   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
As if I care! I can't let this humiliation stand.  
This debacle can't be allowed to continue.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
And above all else&mdash;I can't afford to keep  
running away!   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
I'll reach the ideal. That's what I'm here for.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
So as a magus, I never hesitate in taking the right  
means to my ends.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
Beyond that, I'm unqualified to reach the ideal  
otherwise.   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
This world which shuns me, dullheaded AIs,  
and other magi trying to block my road to the Root!   
  
**Caster's Master:**  
My name is Makiri Zolgen! Carve this name into your  
minds as you drop dead!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(Makiri Zolgen...?)  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(I feel like I've heard this before.)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(I can't remember it clearly...!)

**Makiri:**  
Watch this Composite Noble Phantasm! The peak of  
the prime Build AI's constructive power!   
  
**Makiri:**  
Do it, Caster! Swear on your dreadful True Name that  
you'll kill them!   
  
**Narration:**  
Who am I?   
  
**Narration:**  
Although I have his gold, I am no maréchaux.  
Although I have his faith, I am no zealot. Although I  
have his sword, I am no knight.   
  
**Narration:**  
I am no more than a killer of many wives.   
  
**Narration:**  
A serial killer with no name, hiding a secret chamber  
with a magic key.   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;I am Bluebeard!   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
Oh, oooooooooh.  
A small key opens the door to greater taboo!   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
I fear no dragoons or royal guards!   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
My seventh wife, my eighth, all wives awaiting me in  
the future! Please, please, please!   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
Meet me in the room with great delight!  
Come for me to kill youuuuuuuuuuuu!   
  
[Battle]  
  
### Arrow 4 Post-Battle  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Wh-wh-wh-what in the name of all the gods!?   
  
**Sion:**  
So that's the trump card they talked about?  
It's abnormal in terms of raw size and volume...!   
  
**Kama:**  
Ridiculous in its simplicity.   
  
**Kama:**  
But...that's exactly what makes it a problem.  
When you have this much going for you, cost-  
efficiency stops being an issue.   
  
**Kama:**  
I feel like Caster is assimilated within.  
In this state, he's immune to my corruption.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Alright! I'll speed the discussion up by revealing the  
correct next course of action for us to take:   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
We can't deal with this! Retreat!   
  
**Medusa:**  
Sakura. Command the AIs to evacuate in full.  
That's all we can do now.   
  
**Medusa:**  
And by “full”, I mean leaving the Grow area.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Assume it's unsafe to do anything less. Now do it.   
  
**Sakura:**  
B-but... But!   
  
**Medusa:**  
As a fellow monster, I can sense it. That monster is  
more single-minded about devouring than he ever was  
before.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Right now, we can't beat him in a fight.  
We're prey, and all prey can do is flee.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Consider the destruction of the facilities to be a  
necessary cost at this point.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Getting the AIs to hide in the facilities is a bad idea  
when he's going to consume the buildings whole.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Just get everyone out of here. That doesn't mean  
abandoning Grow forever.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Escaping now is the only way to prevent the true end  
of Grow. No arguing about it, Sakura!   
  
**Sakura:**  
...!   
  
**Makiri:**  
Oh, excellent. Better than I imagined!   
  
**Makiri:**  
Don't worry about your fuel reserves, eat anything  
that moves! You have food everywhere!   
  
**Makiri:**  
Let's get rid of the restraint routines while  
we're&ndash;Hm...? The command responses weren't  
supposed to be this slow...   
  
**Makiri:**  
That way next? You have a good sense of smell for  
living Raniment.   
  
**Makiri:**  
&mdash;Not a problem. His decision making is more  
autopilot than I hoped for, but that doesn't hurt the  
plan.   
  
**Makiri:**  
This power gain makes maneuverability loss still a  
quite favorable trade-off. Fine by me. Consume greedily,  
expand greedily!   
  
**Makiri:**  
You can eat a Servant if you find any.   
  
**Makiri:**  
They won't be able to beat you. No one will!  
Hwhahahahahaha!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Wheeze) D-don't you think we ran far enough?  
That's a fair enough distance for me.   
  
**Sion:**  
What's our current location?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Uh... Around here.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Exactly at the frontier between Grow, Keep,  
and the central Defend area.   
  
**Medusa:**  
The Grow AIs all received the message through  
the G-type communications, right?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Yes. Escaping is the number one priority now.  
I told them to leave without concerning themselves  
with the area.   
  
**Sakura:**  
But they aren't as fast as the T-types.   
  
**Sakura:**  
After we escaped, a large number of them were eaten  
by that giant monster.   
  
**Medusa:**  
They all went their own ways, so the enemy couldn't  
pursue them in all directions at the same time.   
  
**Medusa:**  
You have to believe the damage was minimal.   
  
**Sakura:**  
...  
...   
  
**Kama:**  
(This AI's face is unsettling...  
Reminds me of Parvati.)   
  
**Sakura:**  
Ah, s-sorry. I forgot to thank you for helping me.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Better late than never with courtesies.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I'm...the prime Grow AI and Saber's Master,  
named Sakura by her.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Thank you so, so much.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Repair AIs can't ignore a formal request delivered  
through official channels.   
  
**Sakura:**  
That call was something I tried only for the sake of  
trying... Then why...?   
  
**Ayus:**  
You can tell just by looking that I'm already partnered  
with Assassin's party.   
  
**Ayus:**  
So, you know... It's not like I'm not trying to win the  
Holy Grail War,   
  
**Ayus:**  
but I don't see that as a reason to cut myself off from  
interaction with other AIs.   
  
**Ayus:**  
My hope is to strengthen our connections, even.   
  
**Ayus:**  
And, you know, you don't abandon others for no  
reason, right?   
  
**Sakura:**  
I have to say it again... Thank you so, so much.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
We don't need thanks. We did what anyone would.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
But now that we've calmed down, time for some  
proper observation. Not you either...? I want someone a  
bit more...   
  
**Medusa:**  
What are you doing to Sakura? Get any closer to her  
and I'll kill you on the spot.   
  
**I：Duryodhana:**  
Oho, a dangerous lady with amazing curves...  
Not you either. Yeah, no.   
  
**I：Duryodhana:**  
Heh, seem like neither of you ladies are my soulmate.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I don't know what you're talking about, but&mdash;   
  
**Medusa:**  
You'd better not think that you saving Sakura means  
she owes you anything.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(Saber Medusa...)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(She feels slightly younger...)  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
I don't mind. Berserker might be thinking about who  
owes us, but I don't.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Anyways, the Repair forces should be joining us at  
any moment.   
  
**Ayus:**  
We can fix all the damaged Grow girls.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Now the big question is location. Are we okay to  
gather where we are?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Well, that depends on where Caster—that giant  
monster—will go.   
  
**Ayus:**  
If he's after us, then we should stay on the run.   
  
**Sion:**  
Wait a second. Wasn't he forbidden to attack AIs in  
the Defend area?   
  
**Sion:**  
If we fully enter the central area, which is not far from  
here,   
  
**Sion:**  
then at the very least, we won't have to fear any  
danger to the AIs.   
  
**Sakura:**  
True.   
  
**Sakura:**  
We have a good shot with that, so I'll message all the  
Grow girls telling them to flee to the central partition if  
they can.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Yeah, good! Then we'll go further in and build our  
field hospital there.   
  
**???:**  
I can't recommend that, unfortunately.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Who's there?   
  
**Kama:**  
You're...the prime Defend AI, right?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Yeah, DX. Why are you here?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Wait, this place is bordering Defend, so there's  
nothing particularly weird about your presence.   
  
**Sion:**  
...Your statement intrigues me. Which of our actions  
are you considering unrecommendable?   
  
**DX:**  
This question has multiple answers.   
  
**DX:**  
To allow a mass of Grow AI to join with a mass of  
Repair AI arrived to fix them. And to gather them in the  
Defend partition.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Wait a second. Are you forbidding them to evacuate to  
Defend's area?   
  
**Sakura:**  
As far as I know, Defend's rule of neutrality includes  
becoming a place of refuge during emergencies.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Much like the church in the center is for Holy Grail  
War participants, the AIs need Defend to&ndash;   
  
**DX:**  
...Agreed. That is correct. But I must clarify.   
  
**DX:**  
The neutrality provision of the AI in Defend is not  
functioning.   
  
**DX:**  
The giant monster amalgamation of Caster's  
familiars—identified by the title “worm fiends”,   
  
**DX:**  
has currently invaded the central area and is eating  
every D-type in its path.   
  
## Section 6: Covetous Veneration/for eating  
  
### Arrow 1  
  
**Ayus:**  
Wh-what do you mean!?   
  
**DX:**  
Exactly what I said. The neutrality regulations are not  
being respected.   
  
**DX:**  
We speculate that an unidentified glitch occurred in  
Caster's Master, the prime Build AI's programming.   
  
**DX:**  
Caster's supersized worm fiend is in the vicinity of  
coordinates 17-50, indiscriminately preying upon  
nearby AI.   
  
**DX:**  
There is no distinguishing between G-type refugees,  
the intercepting D-types, or other AI who happened  
to be in the area.   
  
**Sakura:**  
...   
  
**DX:**  
The situation is clearly abnormal.   
  
**DX:**  
Thus, the general supervisor AI suggested I be sent  
here, where multiple Servants are gathered.   
  
**Kama:**  
Rani XII's orders... Eh, whatever. Why does the  
number of Servants here matter?   
  
**DX:**  
The general supervisor AI declares that&mdash;  
the AI Holy Grail War is suspended,   
  
**DX:**  
and, under her overseer jurisdiction, proposes that we  
all cooperate to eliminate the potentially rampaging  
Caster.   
  
**DX:**  
Message to all Servants here:  
Gather at the church with your Masters.   
  
**DX:**  
Saber. Berserker. Assassin...   
  
**DX:**  
And Lancer.   
  
**Lancer:**  
Sure thing.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...!  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(Where have I seen him before?)  
  
---  
  
**Medusa:**  
Lancer. How long have you been here?   
  
**Lancer:**  
You're at the border of my territory.   
  
**Lancer:**  
I was just headed home with my ingredients when it  
suddenly got real noisy behind me.   
  
**Lancer:**  
I wish I were considering the best way to use what I  
procured, but I had to at least check on what was going  
on.   
  
**Kama:**  
I smell another Indian god here.   
  
**Kama:**  
Yours is...Vayu, the wind god...?   
  
**Lancer:**  
Yup. I'm Vayu's son.   
  
**Lancer:**  
By the way, my big bro is Dharma's son, and my little  
bros are Indra's son and the sons of the Asvinau twins.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I knew it was you. Bhima...!   
  
**Bhima:**  
Hey, Duryodhana... Fancy meeting you here.   
  
**Sion:**  
Bhima, son of the wind god Vayu. Fujimaru,  
do you understand the implications of this?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
He's...Arjuna's brother...right?  
  
**Bhima:**  
Hm? Your Master knows Arjuna?   
  
**Bhima:**  
He's the GOAT. I couldn't ask for a better brother.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Though he might have been serious to a troublesome  
degree, not that I think he ever caused anyone real  
problems.   
  
**Bhima:**  
But don't mind it, that's just how he is. Hahahaha!   
  
**Bhima:**  
Ah, I'm here talking as if you were his allies,  
but I still don't know if you actually were. Eh,  
I'm sure you were, you wouldn't still be alive otherwise.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
He's one of the five Pandava princes.  
  
**Bhima:**  
Hoh? Sure, I suppose a Master with a Hindu Divine  
Spirit would know that.   
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
(One of the five Pandava princes and Arjuna's older  
brother, yes. But not only that. Bhima the Mightiest...)   
  
**Sion:**  
(And the person most deeply associated with him in  
folklore is&mdash;)   
  
**Bhima:**  
Don't give me that glare, Duryodhana.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Now's not the time for it.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Wh-wh-what did you say!?   
  
**Ayus:**  
He's right, though. I don't know what history binds  
you and this Lancer,   
  
**Ayus:**  
but the situation with the AIs and Caster's supersized  
creature is more important.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Rani XII told us to come to her church, right?   
  
**DX:**  
Correct. Rider is absent here, but another  
spokesperson relayed him the instructions.   
  
**DX:**  
This is a formal request from the overseer. You must  
obey if possible.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
We have to deal with Caster one way or the other.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Let's go!  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Sure, the more people we have hitting that big lug,  
the better.   
  
**Kama:**  
Less work per person.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hmph. I don't mind going to the church, but definitely  
not with him.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I can never know when he'll stab me in the back.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I'd never be so cowardly.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You lowlife, who do you think you're talking to?   
  
**Ayus:**  
(Whoa, he got all red. That's some real deep-seated  
hatred.)   
  
**Medusa:**  
I don't want to make friends with anyone either.  
We just need to all ultimately arrive at the church, right?   
  
**Medusa:**  
Then we'll go our own way.  
...Sakura.   
  
**Sakura:**  
R-right.   
  
**DX:**  
I request you gather as swiftly as possible.   
  
**Medusa:**  
You don't have to tell us. We'll probably be the first  
there.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Whoa, she jumped away bridal-carrying her girl.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I gotta go back to pick up my Master.   
  
**Bhima:**  
But I'm the son of the wind god. My huge physique  
doesn't slow me down at all.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...  
...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Let's go.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ah, wait for me.   
  
**Sion:**  
These are unforeseen circumstances, but at the very  
least, we managed to confirm who all the Servants are.   
  
**Sion:**  
Let's review all the information we have on the way to  
the church&mdash;   
  
### Arrow 2  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Sulk)   
  
**Ayus:**  
You can't even bother hiding your bad mood.   
  
**Ayus:**  
It's about Lancer, right? He's someone you knew?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Silence. Don't ask.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Nuh-uh...I will ask! Because you're not gonna tell me if  
I don't!   
  
**Ayus:**  
We're talking about a Servant that might become our  
enemy in the Holy Grail War.   
  
**Ayus:**  
It's only natural that your Master would want to know.   
  
**Sion:**  
If you won't talk,   
  
**Sion:**  
we could always present all objective information we  
know to Ayus, from top to bottom.   
  
**Sion:**  
It might contain details you'll find inaccurate or  
unpleasant,   
  
**Sion:**  
but if hearing from you is not an option...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
WHA... Wait, stop!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I can tell all you have to say is worthless nonsense  
saying I'm the irredeemable villain or that everything is  
Duryodhana's fault!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Fine then, I'll tell a bit of the story.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
His group of five brothers were the enemies of us one  
hundred princes.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
But since we hailed from the same country,  
we all learned martial arts under the same mentor.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I see. And why did you become enemies? Why do you  
hate him so much, Berserker?   
  
**Sion:**  
Family trouble is the simplest way to put it.  
A question of who rightfully deserved to inherit the  
kingdom&mdash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Quiet, you.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
There were many reasons, quite a lot of them...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
But the short of it is that they were a dirty pack of  
misunderstanders who didn't know their place.  
That's all.   
  
**Ayus:**  
My instincts tell me the short of it isn't saying enough.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
No, it is. That's how it always has been. That's why  
yours truly and my brothers had been fighting them  
endlessly.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
And the biggest eyesore of the bunch is that guy  
Bhima. Ever since he was a brat, he was all like,  
“Look how big and burly I am. Look how strong I am.”  
 Repulsive.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
My only option to oppose him was the brilliant idea to  
put him to sleep with poison, tie him up before he woke  
up, and throw him down the river.   
  
**Ayus:**  
(Speechless)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
And SOMEHOW, the guy ended up in the Patala realm,  
where he drank the Nagaraja's Amrita and came back  
stronger!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
How unfair! Unforgivable!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Later I took away everything he had in a dice gamble...  
Though that only worked thanks to Uncle Shakuni...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
And then, right, when they were exiled to the woods,  
I visited them to point and laugh,   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
but then I needed them to save me when I was  
captured by some gandharvas! Oh, the humiliation!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Okay! You've heard enough to understand how evil  
they are.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
It's only natural that I wouldn't even want to talk to  
their ilk. Understand me!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Well...okay. You must have been through a lot...  
And so had they.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hmph. That's enough talk. Get moving. We're almost  
at the church.   
  
**Sion:**  
What a blatant attempt to force the conversation to  
an end. Is he avoiding the topic of the all-out war?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I can imagine why.  
  
**Sion:**  
Indeed. Among all five princes, Bhima is the one who  
became a most special part of Duryodhana's past.   
  
**Sion:**  
He certainly doesn't want to say from his own mouth  
that he died in a duel against him&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Why would that be?  
  
**Sion:**  
My knowledge allows me to infer this:   
  
**Sion:**  
Among all five princes, Bhima is the one who became  
a most special part of Duryodhana's past.   
  
**Sion:**  
He certainly doesn't want to admit personally that he  
died in a duel against him&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Lainur:**  
Oops, we the last ones here? My bad, we were pretty  
far away.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Everyone has arrived... Then let us begin.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Greetings to all. It's been some time.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I, in my functions of overseer to the AI Holy Grail War,  
am not allowed to meet you except in the case of  
unforeseen circumstances...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Unfortunately, unforeseen circumstances is exactly  
what we're dealing with here.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(I was brought here against my will...)   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
That's Lancer's Master...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
...?  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Saber's Master said her name is Cerejeira. Not that I  
care.   
  
**Sion:**  
(...? I don't know what, but something feels out of  
place. What can't I put my finger on...?)   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The prime Defend AI already informed you of the  
situation.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Through usage of his Noble Phantasm and a  
construction support spell programmed by his Master,  
Caster transformed into a large abomination modeled  
after his familiars&mdash;   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The creature summoned and merged with—hereby  
named Supersized Worm Fiend—is a monster existing  
solely to devour nearby AI.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It completely ignores the neutrality of Defend,  
so we assume it to be out of control.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It's unclear how much of its actions are affected by its  
Master's will,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
but considering he displayed no attempts to stop it,  
they must be punished for this rule violation.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I, in my functions of overseer to the AI Holy Grail War,  
classify them as a hindrance that must be eliminated  
from the System Grail War.   
  
**Kama:**  
A little slow on the uptake, aren't we? It's been clear  
for a while that they were doing whatever without a  
care for anything.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Managing AI is an element of this Holy Grail War.  
Any action that doesn't affect the world as a whole...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
is accepted as valid strategy&ndash;but causing a  
stampede in the central area is too blatantly unlawful  
to allow.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I can safely say he crossed the line.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
And why do we have to do your dirty work?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It's a known fact that the fighting strength of a  
Servant can only be contained by you, the other  
Servants.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You could say all the Raniment in the world currently  
revolves around you.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Parameter-based reasons aside, I understand you  
question the necessity of this based on your role and  
position.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
As such, I, the overseer, prepared a reward for  
participation in this operation.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Oh? And what would that be?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I promise to share the additional Command Spells  
available to the overseer.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Needless to say, those are supercompressed charges  
of Raniment customized for usage among System Grail  
War Masters.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
They will prove useful in future battles.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Aw. That's nice!   
  
**Sion:**  
Wow... Would it be right to interpret that you'll be  
granting them to everyone here who agrees to  
participate?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That may produce unfair results depending on the size  
of one's contributions.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
While it might be difficult to achieve total fairness,  
I'll trust the logs and observation of the Defend AIs.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
If someone plays a decisive role alone, without  
cooperating with others, they'll be singularly rewarded.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
If you all split tasks as a team, you all stand to be  
rewarded.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Deciding what to do here is another element of the  
Holy Grail War.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I don't think anyone can go out and beat that thing  
alone. We're better off joining forces.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Agreed!  
  
---  
  
**Sakura:**  
Me too... I agree.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Many of Grow's girls must still be near him.  
I can't let harm come to them.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I'll pass.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...!   
  
**Bhima:**  
I've considered it, and decided I got better things to  
do.   
  
**Bhima:**  
With this many people teaming up, you won't need my  
help. You can deal with it.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
That's what you've decided after dragging me all the  
way out here?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Everyone's here. It'd be rude if we didn't at least  
show our faces. But that never meant we were going to  
listen and follow what they said.   
  
**Bhima:**  
You didn't mention any penalties, am I right?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
...Correct. I made the request to everyone, but it was  
nothing more than a request. You are not forced to  
abide.   
  
**Bhima:**  
No problem, then. I'll be the only one missing out on a  
bonus, but that's no bother.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Our delicious dinner is a bonus only I'll get.  
No big difference there. Things are even.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I really don't understand you. No, I kinda do, but...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...  
...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Well... I do agree that we'd just get in everyone's way  
if you don't feel up for it. So&mdash;   
  
**Sakura:**  
It's all right, Cerejeira.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Everyone has their own things they're good at...  
We've got everyone else here.   
  
**Sakura:**  
And I look forward to the tasty dishes you'll make for  
us.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Once things calm down, I'll make sure to go check  
what delicacies my materials are being used for.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Sure...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
We couldn't unite everyone, but this response still falls  
within the predicted range.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Then I'll give you the information necessary to solve  
the situation.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Caster's Supersized Worm Fiend's presumed  
movement routine...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
...is heading in the direction that allows it to obtain the  
most Raniment.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Towards any place populated with AI. Or preferably  
to the closest location, as far as we speculate.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
If more than one choice is available, it'll opt for the  
one containing the largest group.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Its current location is in the north part of the Defend  
partition, coordinates 10-14. It's been heading south  
ever since its emergence in Grow...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Meaning the central part of Defend is within its route.  
It might be trying to reach the church.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
This would mean it entered Defend because the  
population of AIs stationed in Defend...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
...came to outnumber the population of scattered AIs  
running for their lives in Grow.   
  
**Sakura:**  
...  
...   
  
**Medusa:**  
It's not your fault, Sakura. It's Defend who are to  
blame for failing to solve the problem.   
  
**Kama:**  
More importantly, is this church the creature's  
ultimate goal?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
If Caster detects Raniment quantity, then I can't deny  
the possibility he's after what's stored here...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The spare Command Spells intended to be delivered  
to you,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
and the nucleus Raniment used to operate the system.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Assuming its rampage is commanded by a purely  
mechanical routine, then we're mostly guaranteed  
that's what he's working toward.   
  
**Lainur:**  
So that gives us a pretty good picture of its route.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Hah. In that case&ndash;it's obvious what we gotta do.  
We're taking our leave, if you'll excuse us.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Huh!? Weren't we all doing this together!?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Nah, not seeing that future. Do whatever you want.   
  
**Lainur:**  
See ya. Let's go, Rider.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
...  
...   
  
**Kama:**  
Talk about uncooperative!   
  
**Kama:**  
And here I was thinking I'd have less work cut out for  
me. Now we've ended up with only three Servants left.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Weird... Definitely weird.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
How could he prioritize anything other than battle?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Is he...truly Bhima...?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hey, don't go spacing out, Berserker!   
  
**Ayus:**  
I don't know what everyone's up to, but now we've  
gotta do it on our own!   
  
**Ayus:**  
We've got to think about how we'll fight here!   
  
**Sion:**  
Now that we know where the enemy is headed  
toward, we can either wait in its path or intercept it.  
Those are the basic possibilities.   
  
**Sion:**  
The opponent will be stronger than it was the  
previous times we fought.   
  
**Sion:**  
Which means we need an advantage we didn't have  
before.   
  
**Sion:**  
So here is my question:   
  
**Sion:**  
Rani XII. With this being a formal request from the  
overseer, don't you have some sort of plan to  
accommodate us?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
&mdash;Suggestion accepted.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I'll offer certain quantities of pre-stocked Raniment at  
my discretion.   
  
**Sion:**  
Excellent.   
  
**Sion:**  
So what makes this battle different from the previous  
ones is our stock of resources, and the geographical  
advantage of the point at which we'll be waiting for the  
enemy.   
  
**Sion:**  
And&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
Then there's you, Saber.   
  
**Medusa:**  
You're ordering me to work?   
  
**Kama:**  
For what other reason would you have remained here?   
  
**Medusa:**  
...  
...   
  
**Sakura:**  
Saber, please.   
  
**Medusa:**  
...(Sigh)   
  
**Medusa:**  
It's true, this battle is not like the one in Grow.   
  
**Medusa:**  
There will be no G-types around us. Nor any facilities I  
need to worry about.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I have enough Raniment in the tank... I can fight as  
hard as I want.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Although, honestly, I'd rather not have to give it my all  
when anyone can see me.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Are you all right with this, Sakura? This will end with  
us showing our hand to them.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I don't think we have any other choice...   
  
**Sakura:**  
If we don't do what it takes to get rid of that Caster,  
we won't be able to return to Grow.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I just wanna go back to the place I love. To spend  
those quiet times with everyone like we always did...   
  
**Medusa:**  
Got it... I'll do what I must.   
  
**Medusa:**  
But since I'll be going all out, I'll need all of you to  
contribute too.   
  
**Medusa:**  
You're not allowed to slack off like the ones who ran  
away.   
  
**Kama:**  
Slacking off is all I wanted, but guess I can't say no  
here.   
  
**Kama:**  
Our number one slacker, Berserker, has something  
else occupying his mind right now.   
  
**Kama:**  
We need someone on duty kicking his butt to make  
him work.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...  
...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Oh, I can help with kicking his butt!  
And I can also heal it perfectly if it gets sore!   
  
**Ayus:**  
But what are our chances of victory, Saber?   
  
**Medusa:**  
We won't know until we try,   
  
**Medusa:**  
but at very least, since collateral damage is not a  
problem,   
  
**Medusa:**  
it becomes a competition between me and that worm  
fiend...   
  
**Medusa:**  
To decide which of us is the greater rampaging  
monster&mdash;   
  
### Arrow 3 Pre-Battle  
  
**Narration:**  
The creature advances.   
  
**Narration:**  
I seek only to fulfill my simple and clear desires,  
as permitted to me.   
  
**Narration:**  
To devour.   
  
**Narration:**  
To trample over the weak, to rip apart those who owe  
him complete obedience&mdash;to end their lives.   
  
**Narration:**  
Ah&mdash;Ah!   
  
**Narration:**  
Acknowledgments of terror. Wishes for escape denied.  
Eyes enlightened to their fates. Screams sweet as  
nectar.   
  
**Narration:**  
Have you ever been inside a creature's mouth before?  
Yes? No?   
  
**Narration:**  
Both answers are the same.   
  
**Narration:**  
It's like the red room. This has the same color, smell,  
and screams as that room decorated with foolish  
brides... Thus, the same taste.   
  
**Narration:**  
I need no longer wait for any sacrifices.  
I can simply walk towards new brides.   
  
**Narration:**  
I understand what its body is.   
  
**Narration:**  
I can smell it on its skin.   
  
**Narration:**  
Could it be? Yes, it is. The taboo overflowing from the  
room is now me.   
  
**Narration:**  
I am the forbidden room.   
  
**Narration:**  
You mustn't look at it. Never ever look at it.  
(Though l leave the key in your hands.)   
  
**Narration:**  
You mustn't enter it. Never ever enter it.  
(Though l leave the key in your hands.)   
  
**Narration:**  
I can't tell what I'd do if you disobey this, my wife  
beloved&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
But now you're looking at it. Now your scared eyes  
are looking at I, the room.   
  
**Narration:**  
That's no different from being inside.   
  
**Narration:**  
Where's my next wife? Where is the wife bearing my  
magic key&mdash;?   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;Who am I?   
  
**Narration:**  
Of course I know.   
  
**Narration:**  
I exist to understand everything.  
I exist to reach the ideal.   
  
**Narration:**  
The logos of the world. The alpha and the omega.  
The absolute laws of creation.   
  
**Narration:**  
The Root.   
  
**Narration:**  
Thus, I couldn't go on without knowing who I am.   
  
**Narration:**  
The prime Build AI. Caster's Master.  
&mdash;Makiri Zolgen. A superior magus.   
  
**Narration:**  
The last pure-blooded Makiri, and the greatest  
successor the family ever had. The perfect one,  
incapable of failure.   
  
**Narration:**  
I don't know the meaning of those words, but I  
understand their essence. That's who I am.   
  
**Narration:**  
Which is why&mdash;   
  
**Makiri:**  
Haha... Hahahahaha!  
Yes, YES, YES!   
  
**Narration:**  
This exhilaration from seeing how the trump card I  
analyzed Caster's Noble Phantasm to construct is  
performing almost perfectly,   
  
**Narration:**  
combined with the relief from finding confirmation of  
my competence, vibrated the air in my lungs in the form  
of laughter.   
  
**Narration:**  
On the other hand, something else in my chest  
squirmed.   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;Am I justified?   
  
**Narration:**  
No.   
  
**Narration:**  
Nay. Wrong. This very question is mistaken.   
  
**Narration:**  
Victory justifies everything.  
Reaching the ideal justifies everything.   
  
**Narration:**  
That's the magus he was&mdash;and that's how I,  
born as him, operate.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Yes. I must reach the ideal.   
  
**Makiri:**  
For that purpose...I have things I ought to discard...  
and feelings I ought to kill off...!   
  
**Narration:**  
If I had to point at one fatal fallacy to the current  
version of my blueprint,   
  
**Narration:**  
it would certainly be its pitiful resilience.   
  
**Narration:**  
I've been dissatisfied at how one as competent as  
myself was forced to disengage and retreat over  
numerical disadvantages.   
  
**Narration:**  
And what I used to clear up this accumulated  
dissatisfaction...   
  
**Narration:**  
was a trump card that sacrificed handling to display  
my competency through extra power.   
  
**Narration:**  
And that went beyond expectations.  
It went beyond my estimated margin.   
  
**Narration:**  
Unable to withstand the inflexibility of the mold I  
established for it, its contents are&mdash;overflowing as  
they will.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Haha... Hahaha...   
  
**Narration:**  
As such, all creaks of humanity supposedly remaining  
in me are gone.   
  
**Narration:**  
All that's left is the purest form of a magus,  
simply pursuing the ideal in the name of logic.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Ah, yes.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Rules? Neutrality? Who cares?   
  
**Makiri:**  
Look at this power. Look at this all-consuming power.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Since I'm the most superior being in existence and it's  
all but guaranteed that I'll become the next lord of this  
world,   
  
**Makiri:**  
and if that's the one fastest road to the ideal,   
  
**Makiri:**  
what could possibly be wrong with me consuming  
everything in the old world&mdash;?   
  
**Narration:**  
Only one end awaits models not built for resilience.   
  
**Narration:**  
They break.   
  
**Sion:**  
Reviewing the operation one last time.   
  
**Sion:**  
We're following a simple formula, but we have to go  
over it one more time from the top to make sure  
everything is in order.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Completely agreed.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Do your thing, boss.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
The enemy, Caster's Supersized Worm Fiend,  
is heading south as predicted. Marching at 97% the  
calculated pace.   
  
**Sion:**  
We must thank the unfortunate AIs who fell victim to it,  
unable to escape despite making optimal decisions,   
  
**Sion:**  
and the work of the Defend AIs killed in action.   
  
**Ayus:**  
True. Now is not the time to be gloomy about it.  
We need to do our best to avoid greater casualties.   
  
**Sion:**  
Exactly.   
  
**Sion:**  
Our final objective is eliminating Caster and the  
Supersized Worm Fiend he's merged with.   
  
**Sion:**  
Dealing with the medium and small worm fiends  
present around it is also a necessity,   
  
**Sion:**  
but it's predicted they'll vanish if their controller,  
Caster, is defeated. We don't need to crush all of  
them.   
  
**Sion:**  
What's important is to clean up the fodder in front of  
the Supersized Worm Fiend and halt its march.   
  
**Sion:**  
Since the creature detects AIs with Raniment,   
  
**Sion:**  
it's natural to assume it also detects Servants,  
which hold higher concentrations of Raniment.   
  
**Sion:**  
In short, we'll eliminate the surrounding worm fiends,  
attracting the Supersized's attention,   
  
**Sion:**  
and attack the main body whenever possible to  
whittle it down&mdash;That's our part.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Naaah, I'll pass. Sweeping small fry is no job for a  
prince.   
  
**Ayus:**  
No complaining!   
  
**Ayus:**  
(...But is he back in the mood? Not that he was  
supposed to make strategic decisions for such spoiled  
reasons though!)   
  
**Kama:**  
So the whole point here is...we're the decoy.   
  
**Kama:**  
I'm the god of love.   
  
**Kama:**  
I'm an awful pick for these meatheaded tasks like  
blowing away the giant monster or physically wearing  
it down with overwhelming destructive force.   
  
**Kama:**  
I'll do what I can even if I'm not cut out for it,  
but are you really sure we can leave the job to her?   
  
**Medusa:**  
If I'm the only option, that's how it has to be.  
If anyone else is qualified, I can swap places.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I don't think anyone is.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Taking off a couple legs probably won't be enough to  
stop that giant monster.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I think the only way to go is through its heart...  
killing its core, which is presumably Caster. The big  
problem is:   
  
**Sakura:**  
We don't know where in that huge body Caster is.   
  
**Sion:**  
True. We're searching for that specific point,  
but we've yet to have a clear answer.   
  
**Sion:**  
(Sakura... The prime Grow AI. She seems to have a  
non-combative personality, much like Ayus.)   
  
**Sion:**  
(But I see she still has the capabilities of a Master...)   
  
**Sakura:**  
With Saber's full power, we can...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Oh. We can find where the damned Caster is?   
  
**Medusa:**  
No. I can fillet the whole fish and petrify each piece.  
If I keep doing that, I'll eventually get to the right part.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Oh, fine. A lot less technical than I expected.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
All right then, that sort of unappealing manual labor is  
not for me. You can handle it.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
This talk about having to find him reminded me of one thing.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
What about the option of targeting his Master?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
It's a possible solution, naturally. The idea is to sever  
his root source of magical energy.   
  
**Sion:**  
But the fact that the monster is self-sustaining is a  
serious obstacle to this approach.   
  
**Sion:**  
The Master needs to stay at a safe distance from the  
hubbub, but that doesn't mean he's within our reach.   
  
**Sion:**  
The enemy is aware that eliminating the Master is an  
option, so he should be doing everything he can to hide  
himself.   
  
**Sion:**  
We must consider it unrealistic to locate the Master  
within our limited time frame.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Looking at him really upset me for some reason,  
so I'd ideally prefer to win by crushing that Master's  
head.   
  
**Medusa:**  
But if that's impossible, I suppose we have to deal  
with the big guy.   
  
**Medusa:**  
By the way...can you two stand side by side?   
  
**Both:**  
...?   
  
**Medusa:**  
(They feel similar... Yet different... Maybe opposites.  
Eh, doesn't matter.)   
  
**Medusa:**  
&mdash;Don't mind me. Anyways, we have a plan.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I'll be waiting somewhere easier for me to deal the  
first strike.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Then I'll take the first step when I find the chance and  
you follow up after me.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Wait, Saber...   
  
**Sakura:**  
Sorry, people. I'll also be moving to my post. Bye.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ah, wait. How are you feeling in the parts I healed  
before?   
  
**Ayus:**  
I'm curious since it was my first time healing a Master.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I'm perfectly fine, thank you very much.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Look how full of energy I am.  
Heya!    
  
**Ayus:**  
Really? I hope so... Don't hesitate to call me if  
anything comes up.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Of course. I'm counting on you!   
  
**Sion:**  
It's here.   
  
**Sion:**  
I'm always estimating future actions with Thought  
Acceleration, but it's always possible for unpredicted  
events to occur.   
  
**Sion:**  
Be prepared to ad-lib as needed.   
  
**Kama:**  
Yeah, sure. Such unexpected events are exactly what  
I'd want your calculations to cover.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Then let's go for it!  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
As I thought, this is completely wrong. This vanguard  
work is for the foot soldiers.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Yours truly's role is to take the enemy general's head,  
looking really cool in the process. How did it come to  
this...?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I don't feel like doing this will give me what I want.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Stop grumbling!   
  
**Ayus:**  
If you get hurt, I swear on Repair's pride that I'll heal  
you immediately.   
  
**Ayus:**  
But don't get hurt if you can help it!  
Take care, everyone!   
  
[Battle]  
  
### Arrow 4 Pre-Battle  
  
**Rani-T:**  
Leader, where do we deliver this to?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Over there. Hurry. I hate people wasting my time.   
  
**N：Rani-T:**  
You don't need to say that to us S P E E D S T E R S.  
Our velocity will astonish you. Whoosh.   
  
**Lainur:**  
This goes here and...   
  
**Lainur:**  
Kehehe, things are coming up Lainur.   
  
**Lainur:**  
No, I suppose this spell's formula is better placed here.  
That'll require some minor adjustments. Gotta trim  
down the fat wherever possible...   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
What do you see, Master?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Oh. Heheh, curious?   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
&mdash;Not at all. I'm my lord's sword. I don't  
question anything.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Allow me to revise my words. That question was a  
mistake. I pray you will forget it.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
I&mdash;lack the perspective to see what my lord sees,   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
much less to see beyond what my lord sees.   
  
**Lainur:**  
There's one thought that's been nagging me.  
How do I put it? You're like...   
  
**Lainur:**  
Are you trying to make yourself look less competent  
than you are?   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
...  
...   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
I'd never. Competent or otherwise,   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
the truth is that I'm my lord's blade and nothing else.  
Nothing more and nothing less.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Hmph. Whatever. Here's the answer to your question.   
  
**Lainur:**  
The only answer I got for “what I'm seeing” is  
“the future”.   
  
**Lainur:**  
But the future I see is not THE future. It's just a  
product of measurement and estimation.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
...  
...   
  
**Lainur:**  
Oh-hoh. This time you managed to hold back on your  
question.   
  
**Lainur:**  
You really are like a steel blade, general. Though I  
don't know if I'm just seein' what I want to see.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Anyways&mdash;there's a lot of nuance I'm skipping,  
but I'll cover the gist of it.   
  
**Lainur:**  
There's one thing I gotta make clear so ya don't  
misunderstand me.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I'm just doin' whatever I want, and I have no clue what  
the future will actually be like.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Will they win or will they lose? That's naturally  
something only they can decide&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Kama, next wave at 4 o'clock!  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Already on it. I suppose we don't need words to know  
what the other is thinking.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Killsteal chance! Doooo...ryah!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Ey, I should've guessed this guy was too big even for  
the master of the cudgel!   
  
**Kama:**  
He ran for a solo raid!   
  
**Kama:**  
I figured he would, but what is he thinking?  
He's drawing all the aggro to himself.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Say what?  
&mdash;Wooooooooooh!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Stand down!   
  
**Kama:**  
Okay, that's enough fodder cleaned up, and we  
managed to get the big lug's attention. Can we get this  
over with?   
  
**Kama:**  
What kind of show will Ms. Sourface put out for  
us&mdash;?   
  
**Medusa:**  
Time for me to go. Wait somewhere safe, Sakura.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I'm your Master. I'll be watching from here. Also...   
  
**Sakura:**  
Heya! For you&mdash;with enthusiasm.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I got my own Raniment to present you with,  
in addition to the general supervisor's support funds.   
  
**Sakura:**  
My secret stash for situations like this.  
Use as much of it as you need.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Sure... Thank you.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Then I'll be using this Raniment to change my Saint  
Graph into a form more suited for combat.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Step back.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Whoa. So cool... Did I hear you click your tongue?   
  
**Medusa:**  
Disgracefully enough, I seem to bear dregs of  
Athena's essence within me.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Bear dregs...? Akh, her harrowing influence is taking  
ahold of my verbiag&ndash;She's affecting the way I talk.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Hehe. I don't mind how you talk. Do whatever feels  
the most natural to you.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Neither is favored by my dispositions.   
  
**Medusa:**  
...For the time being, I shall abide by her involuted  
phraseology.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I am your Servant.   
  
**Medusa:**  
It is evident to me in this state that I'm obliged to  
offer you refined communication.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Regardless, I remain ever myself. My essence is  
constant.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Yeah, I can tell.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Farewell.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Bye, Saber. Take care.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Huh... What was that?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Nothing that matters right now. Eyes focused on her.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Good luck, Saber...!   
  
**Medusa:**  
Chrysaor.   
  
**Medusa:**  
The something born of my blood. The creature with  
the golden sword, who later became the father of  
many monsters.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Ergo, through this sword did the fiend Medusa  
connect herself to the lineage of monsters.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Monsters, crunch and tear.  
Monsters, digest and upset.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Once prey runs thin...   
  
**Medusa:**  
These eyes of mine can handle the rest!   
  
### Arrow 4 Post-Battle  
  
**DX:**  
...  
...   
  
**Narration:**  
The prime Defend AI watched the distant scenes,  
reevaluating her own role.   
  
**Narration:**  
She existed to fulfill this role.   
  
**Narration:**  
There was a non-zero possibility that the enemy  
creature would arrive where she was.   
  
**Narration:**  
Or that a stray bullet could fly in her direction.   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;What then?   
  
**Narration:**  
A foolish question. She had to protect the place,  
even at the cost of her life. That's who she was.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
What's the situation looking like?   
  
**DX:**  
All-out combat started a while ago. The enemy  
creature temporarily halted its march.   
  
**DX:**  
Could you not have discovered the situation's current  
state without needing to leave your premises or ask this  
unit?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Yes, but I didn't feel like it.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Whatever happens here, it'll greatly affect the Holy  
Grail War. Perhaps it'll be the true first step towards it.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Even under this false sky,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
going outside is the most apt way to watch great  
movement in the stars.   
  
**DX:**  
...Incomprehensible.   
  
**Narration:**  
Uttering no further words, she watched the wriggling  
figure of the giant monster.   
  
**Narration:**  
And then&mdash;   
  
### Arrow 5 Pre-Battle  
  
**Medusa:**  
...Tsk.   
  
**Medusa:**  
(An unheralded turnabout. Despite its immense size...)   
  
**Medusa:**  
(It regenerates!)   
  
**Medusa:**  
(And Caster is presumably shifting his position within  
the body every time I target it&ndash;!)   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
She's taking a long time...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I feel like things aren't going as she planned...!  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Oh dear. The situation is sure looking gloomy.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Can we send reinforcements?  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Hehe, I can't say no with you begging like this.   
  
**Kama:**  
Sure, why not? I'll help.   
  
**Kama:**  
But in exchange, you better reward me properly once  
everything works out, okay?   
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hey you, no slacking!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
With the cannon fodder out of the way, we can attack  
the thing directly once more.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I tell you, you three can't get anything done without  
yours truly.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Write as such in the chronicles:   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
The scheme was thrown into disarray, leaving  
everyone at the end of their ropes, but that's where the  
great Duryodhana offered his helping hand,   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
and saved the day. All was thanks to him!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(I'll give it another try and run away if it goes badly.)   
  
**Ayus:**  
With this face he's making, I don't know if I'm  
supposed to praise him or not...   
  
### Arrow 5 Post-Battle  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Huffing) Look at...how much work...you put...  
yours truly through...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Finish this already!   
  
**Medusa:**  
Matters lack the simplicity your speech implies.   
  
**Medusa:**  
(I do have all the advantage. But my resources aren't  
infinite.)   
  
**Medusa:**  
(I need to catch my breath. Quick, quick&mdash;)   
  
**Medusa:**  
...!   
  
**Medusa:**  
(Sakura's Raniment! Where did she hide so much?)   
  
**Medusa:**  
(&mdash;I don't have time to think about it.  
I need to capitalize on this chance!)   
  
**Medusa:**  
Circumstance allows me to stake all in dubois artifice.  
If I expand the effective area of my Mystic Eyes,   
  
**Medusa:**  
I could petrify all estimated positions of Caster's  
location&mdash;!   
  
**Medusa:**  
...   
  
**Medusa:**  
Everything is clear. The petrification is unmistakably in  
effect.   
  
**Medusa:**  
It's reaching where Caster is.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Don't lie to me! It that's the case, then why is he not  
defeated!?   
  
**Medusa:**  
Due to his immense size, even my Mystic Eyes need  
some time to transmit the petrification to the target.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Right now, Caster is like a parasite dwelling in all that  
meat.   
  
**Medusa:**  
While the outer layers becomes statues of  
stone&ndash;he hides deeper newly-born strata of flesh.   
  
**Sion:**  
He's like a Russian matryoshka doll,   
  
**Sion:**  
unleashing worm fiends within the petrified worm  
fiend and leaving them to take the blow meant for  
him&mdash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
C'mon, then...what are we going to do?   
  
**Kama:**  
If the petrification can't get to Caster even if we  
locate him...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Then how in the world do we beat him...!?   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
Ah. The room is full of secrets. The dead bodies of the  
wives who mocked me.   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
Any wife who sees them becomes another corpse.  
And then so does the next wife. And the next wife.   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
It's infinite, infinite, infinite!   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
There's no limit to how many bloodied wives fit in the  
room. There's no limit to how many times the taboo  
can be indulged!   
  
**Sion:**  
Was his Noble Phantasm always equipped with the  
concept of cycles and infinity...?   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
HAHAHA, HAHAHAHAHA&mdash;   
  
### Arrow 6  
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;Who am I?   
  
**Narration:**  
How am I supposed to know?   
  
**Narration:**  
I have a sound memory. I can remember past  
memories without much effort.   
  
**Narration:**  
I don't see the point in going through the trouble of  
using my hands to transcribe records of events into  
different media.   
  
**Narration:**  
I know that pretty well, but&mdash;why is it, then?   
  
**Narration:**  
Why do I feel this relief every time I look back at them?   
  
**Narration:**  
I feel at peace whenever I compare external records  
to my memories and confirm they're the same.   
  
**Narration:**  
This act might well be my only form of recreation.   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;But...   
  
**Narration:**  
No matter how many times I reread the beginning,  
I can't find the page revealing what this feeling is.   
  
**Narration:**  
It's not written anywhere.   
  
**Narration:**  
As I said, it's always been here. Inside me.   
  
**Narration:**  
Why? Why? Why?   
  
**Narration:**  
Why do I&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;feel so guilty?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Yo... Writing your diary again?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Not the first time I'm telling you this, but you can store  
data in your inner memory.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Why do you go through the trouble of converting  
materials into pen and paper to record it?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Why do you care? I just...feel like it.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Haha, sure, whatever floats your boat. Surprisingly  
uncomplicated answer.   
  
**Bhima:**  
That's a thing in cooking too. These moods you can't  
explain are a core concept driving people to make food  
taste good.   
  
**Bhima:**  
If all that mattered was filling your belly and getting  
nutrients, we'd have all sorts of alternatives to our  
cuisine.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Anyways, here's the new dish I finished with the  
ingredients from Grow.   
  
**Bhima:**  
A masterpiece of provocative spice, deep flavor,  
simple sauce, and creative choice of ingredients.   
  
**Bhima:**  
You know what this is? The perfect companion for the  
naan I made before&mdash;Curry a la Pandava!   
  
**Bhima:**  
C'mon, eat it! Go for it! Put that diary away so you  
won't stain the pages!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I don't need any...but I know you'll force it down my  
mouth no matter what I say. (Sigh)   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Here goes nothing...   
  
**Bhima:**  
Nice!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Yeah... Taste's plain good. Thanks.   
  
**Bhima:**  
“Plain”? Hmm... And your face...the same as always...   
  
**Bhima:**  
Hrmmmmmm!   
  
**Bhima:**  
At least I got some response. But if it were  
Yudhishthira, Arjuna, Nakula, or Sahadeva,   
  
**Bhima:**  
I'm sure I'd be seeing them smile. Still&mdash;   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Sorry... I'm wasting all the effort you went through to  
make this.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I did like the taste of it. I really mean it. It's just there's  
something more important&mdash;   
  
**Bhima:**  
I know. Filling up your empty heart is something  
grander than any dish I can make.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Right?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Yeah. That's... That's right.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Say, Lancer.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
How do you deal with guilt you can't find the cause of  
no matter how hard you try?   
  
**Bhima:**  
...  
...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I don't know. I really don't. But it's definitely inside  
me.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
That's why I'm afraid of doing anything.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I'm glad you said we'd be going back after hearing all  
that talk in the church.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
If that's how it is, I don't wanna do anything.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Still... Hehe, how awful. The ones who stayed with  
Sakura are all fighting right now.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
And here I am, alone, feeling bad over not doing  
anything.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
One more thing to feel guilty about.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
There's really no fixing me.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I know I'm not making sense. But I don't know the  
meaning or the reason behind how I am...   
  
**Bhima:**  
Master...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I feel like the diary wasn't as much of a waste of time  
as I thought it'd be.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Because I approached it already knowing that writing  
wouldn't give any answers.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
So... Sorry, Lancer.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I know you just wanna make me cheer up with your  
meal and then do your best in the Holy Grail War.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
But that's probably not gonna work with me.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
The guilt in my heart...won't disappear, no matter  
what.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
So if you're really in it for the win, replace me  
for&mdash;   
  
**Bhima:**  
Good grief. You still don't get it?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Huh?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Nothing. The point is that you have no space for my  
masterpiece curry because you're full with their situation.   
  
**Bhima:**  
That'd mean...I didn't do a good enough job setting up  
the dinner table.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Yeah, I can see how that's my mistake.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Then I'll just get this solved real quick. Wait right there.  
We'll have a proper do-over when I'm back.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...?   
  
**Makiri:**  
Heheheh, hahaha...!   
  
**Makiri:**  
I was right. It's all about the basics. The winner is the  
one who masters the basics!   
  
**Makiri:**  
The war for supplies is the most important part.  
Whoever stockpiles resources more efficiently is  
guaranteed to win!   
  
**Makiri:**  
And whoever can come up with a system that makes  
strength directly proportional to amounts of resources  
is guaranteed to win!   
  
**Makiri:**  
Any fool who can't figure out this much...deserves to  
lose!   
  
**Makiri:**  
I knew it, the one meant to reach the ideal,  
the Root is I, Makiri Zolgen&mdash;   
  
**Makiri:**  
...What?   
  
**M：Bhima:**  
No one beats you when it comes to greed, envy,  
and pride, I'll give you that.   
  
**M：Bhima:**  
You can't stand anyone seeing you lose, so you send  
your guys far ahead of yourself&mdash;   
  
**M：Bhima:**  
Yeah, I'm very used to finding sorts like you,  
who hide in the distance to survive. Though all I'm  
really doing is following my intuition.   
  
**M：Bhima:**  
Ah, my bad, it was rude to compare you to him.   
  
**M：Bhima:**  
I could still sorta see the light of justice suppressed by  
logic and reason deep within your eyes.   
  
**M：Bhima:**  
&mdash;That is, when I saw you from a distance,  
before you started this mess.   
  
**M：Bhima:**  
What, you can't handle the caliber of your new power  
and you're losing balance? I get you. Big flames are  
hard to handle.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Gh...aha... Y-you...   
  
**Makiri:**  
Co...ward...   
  
**M：Bhima:**  
...  
...   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;Who am I?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I know I'm not making sense. But I don't know the  
meaning or the reason behind how I am...   
  
**Bhima:**  
Yeah, I must be the same. This always felt a little  
weird.   
  
**Bhima:**  
If I were my true warrior self in this situation where  
my companions' lives aren't in any direct danger,   
  
**Bhima:**  
I wouldn't have let this weak shrimp turn evil.  
So, now I'm very surprised at myself.   
  
**Makiri:**  
You...  
...Gheh...   
  
**Bhima:**  
But as I am now, I really am&mdash;just a cook,  
it seems.   
  
**Bhima:**  
So, just like this, I'll do the chores to set a good chef's  
table.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Killing the weak is idiotic.   
  
**Bhima:**  
&mdash;But a cook doesn't hold any opinions about  
every squirming fish they slice open.   
  
**Narration:**  
Screw this, screw this, screw this. I am...   
  
**Narration:**  
I am Makiri　 Makiri Zolgen, proud magus of   
  
**Narration:**  
Magus?   
  
**Narration:**  
Ah　That's not it　That is it　I'm　Am I?   
  
**Narration:**  
I am　partial　personality data  
artificially created　thus&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;Damn it.   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
&mdash;   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
Could...it...be...?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...?  
  
---  
  
**Bluebeard:**  
Damned dragoons... So there was another enemy  
besides you!   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
Damned be you, lowlife brothers of my lowlife wife!   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
The room was locked at its origins, ooooh,  
OOOOOOOOOH...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
He's...gone?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
What happened?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
The signs of Caster and the Supersized Worm Fiend  
are completely gone.   
  
**Sion:**  
Something happened to his Master, presumably.   
  
**Sion:**  
Judging by the situation, it's possible he was  
eliminated.   
  
**Kama:**  
By whom?   
  
**Sion:**  
The number one candidates are Lancer and Rider,  
who didn't participate in this operation.   
  
**Sion:**  
Though I don't know if it was coincidental or if that  
was their plan all along.   
  
**Ayus:**  
But why would Caster disappear along with him?   
  
**Sion:**  
Operating the Supersized Worm Fiend requires  
constant consumption of vast amounts of Raniment.   
  
**Sion:**  
He suddenly lost access to his main stock, yet he  
didn't stop summoning more worm fiends&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
Even the Raniment required for the Caster Servant to  
exist was instantly drained by his own Noble Phantasm.   
  
**Sion:**  
That's the chain of events as I conjecture it.   
  
**Sion:**  
(It's far from the only possibility though...)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Talk about anticlimactic. Unacceptable. I can't be  
satisfied with this!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Just be happy it's over and that everyone's safe.   
  
**Ayus:**  
It IS over...right?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I've confirmed Caster's Supersized Worm Fiend's  
erasure.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Congratulations to all fighters.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Whoa, the general supervisor's exclusive transmission!  
So cool.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Excellent.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Phew...   
  
**Sakura:**  
Great job, Saber! You worked so hard!   
  
**Medusa:**  
No... I didn't overexert myself. I just did what I had to.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Fine, if you say it's over, then it is. So where's my  
reward?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
...  
...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hello?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I am in the middle of an intracerebral debate.  
Please hold.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Definition verified. Information acquired. Records  
reproduced... Circumstances inputted. Deliberation.  
Comparison. Deliberation. Comparison. Contradiction  
search.  
&mdash;No objections.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Conclusion derived.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The decisive factor in this result was the termination  
of functions for the Master of Caster.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I regard accomplishing that as the greatest  
contribution,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
and will grant the Command Spell reward to the  
Master of who did it.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That said, I'm in no way inflexible.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I'll reimburse the expended Raniment for all  
participants later on.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Message over. I expect more from you in the upcoming  
battles. You're cordially invited to start them.  
Yours sincerely, Rani XII.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Wh-WHAAAAAAT!? After all we did, all we get is a  
reimbursement!?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You can't trick me!  
This is a SCAM!   
  
**Medusa:**  
I figured that's how things would turn out.   
  
**Sakura:**  
But one thing is for sure... That monster is dead.   
  
**Sakura:**  
No one else from Grow, or any other AI, will be eaten...   
  
**Sakura:**  
Our usual peace will return to Grow. I can go back to  
the work I love. That's great news.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
It's a shame we didn't get any Command Spells,  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
but you're right that peace is an important reward.  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Peace doesn't fill anyone's stomach. It's absurd that  
yours truly's combat spectacle didn't return any profit.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I'd never spare any efforts to get what I want,   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
but I'm quite disinclined to spare efforts for what I  
don't want. It's humiliating...!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Quit grumbling!   
  
**Ayus:**  
I agree, it's a shame we didn't get a Command Spell,  
but you can say our battle earned us a big chance to  
make money.   
  
**Ayus:**  
It's not a thing we should be celebrating, but facts are  
facts.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Now that the creature is dead, the next thing to do  
is&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
The damage treatment phase. We've got injured  
Defend and Grow AIs all over the place, and more.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Meaning now is the time we of Repair really earn our  
bread! We have no time to complain!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Woohoo! Repairing spirit!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
She's on fire...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
We'll help too.  
  
**Ayus:**  
Will you? Thanks!   
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
(Sigh) That was a waste of labor if I ever saw one.  
All that work and all we get is our costs expensed.   
  
**Kama:**  
What was the name for this again?  
Job satisfaction exploitation?   
  
**Kama:**  
Job satisfaction, huh... Despite everything, I did my  
best, you know...? (Glances)   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Right. I should have said it earlier,  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
but thank you for your hard work.  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Ehehe. That's what I wanted to hear. Job satisfaction  
obtained! Now we broke even!   
  
**Kama:**  
Oh, did you want to pat my head? No? Bleh.   
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...   
  
**Narration:**  
“It was too rudimentary a conclusion.”   
  
**Narration:**  
“Therefore,”   
  
**Narration:**  
thought the Bird,  
watching over the world from far on high,   
  
**Narration:**  
“this has thus been&mdash;not adequate for a first step.”   
  
**Narration:**  
It deemed it all below “first step” level.   
  
**Narration:**  
The situation supported her remark.   
  
**Narration:**  
Someone received a trivial extension of time.  
One fighting for his life as any being with a will would.   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
(Panting) Any respectable husband has a gold-plated  
carriage...   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
A carriage of Mystery nature, of course. As long as I  
have it, yes...I can always return home...   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
However, alas, however...!   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
What is a man like me without a fortune?  
Who would want to be my wife...?   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
My eyes hath turned blind. But I am a Servant.  
Would the reaper's scythe harvest already-fallen  
crops? Who is there?   
  
**???:**  
...  
...   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
&mdash;What's wrong? Why won't you deliver the  
coup de grâce?   
  
**Narration:**  
Furthermore, the Master's handling was lenient.   
  
**Narration:**  
His jurisdiction was supposed to be transferred to the  
victor. This is part of the rules of the Holy Grail War.   
  
**Narration:**  
Even without the winning Master nearby, this could be  
done by gouging out the AI Core and carrying it away.   
  
**Narration:**  
But Lancer only destroyed his outer shell and left  
satisfied.   
  
**Narration:**  
He even left the Command Spell there&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
“Then I should give you another chance.”   
  
**Narration:**  
“Many details didn't fall within my calculations,  
as they naturally wouldn't, but despite so, the current  
situation is too stable.”   
  
**Narration:**  
“I observe far too many units unwilling to take the  
initiative in combat.”   
  
**Narration:**  
“That is a major problem. I need Masters and Servants  
to fight and kill one another.”   
  
**Narration:**  
This is what powers the crux of the AEC Method.  
This is the driving force making the world go round.   
  
**Narration:**  
“Ergo, I will create one new Master.”   
  
**Narration:**  
Fortunately, the prototype model used for Build's  
prime was an “Invented”... This allows for a certain level  
of creativity.   
  
**Narration:**  
Come thus, bearing evil within, AI Master.   
  
**Narration:**  
Alterego Invented Master.   
  
## Section 7: Dull Pain Is Never Visible/re-construction  
  
### Arrow 1  
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Geez... Where did he go?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
He got really heated all of a sudden, so I wanted to  
ask what got into him.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(No, it wasn't that big a deal. There's no way that  
was a definitive goodbye...)   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(But if I never saw him again because he blew up at  
how I was talking like a crazy woman,)   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(I'd feel abandoned, which wouldn't do my  
depression any favors...)   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(Well, I can't deny...I didn't sound very sane.  
Maybe I'm reaping what I sowed.)   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(Sigh)   
  
**B：Rani-K:**  
Prime AI.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Wah! Wh-what?   
  
**B：Rani-K:**  
It's time for our regular replenishment.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Sure. Good idea.   
  
**C：Rani-K:**  
I feel strangely defeated saying this,   
  
**C：Rani-K:**  
but his methods are effective and capable of  
increasing the motivation parameter.   
  
**C：Rani-K:**  
With this logical reason as basis, I'm not frustrated  
about it. Yes, it bears repeating: I am not frustrated.   
  
**C：Rani-K:**  
Which brings us to our question: may we have some  
of the new model of processed materials...  
a.k.a., a “dish”?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Don't you all normally say “We don't need creativity.  
Stability first and foremost”?   
  
**D：Rani-K:**  
That's what we thought. No, we still do.   
  
**D：Rani-K:**  
But once we experienced the taste of his cooking  
buffing unidentified parameters,   
  
**D：Rani-K:**  
we choose the option that has more to offer.  
That's a logical conclusion.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(Are they starting to become picky eaters...?)   
  
**B：Rani-K:**  
Prime AI, you're the cooking Lancer's Master.   
  
**B：Rani-K:**  
I must ask you whether I'm right in my theory that you  
learned similar abilities.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I... I...   
  
**Rani-K:**  
(Eyes filled with expectation)   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...Okay. I'll give it a shot, but don't get your hopes up.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Here... I really just converted materials at random,  
so I don't care how it tastes.   
  
**Rani-K=spot:**  
WOAH.   
  
**Rani-K=spot:**  
I infer this dish is of a type we haven't seen before.  
Please provide a name with which to register it in the  
database.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Huh... It's...ratatouille? Probably. I'm not sure.   
  
**B：Rani-K:**  
Registration complete. Now if you excuse me,  
I'll replenish myself with it.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Wait. Sprinkle this powder on it. Just one shake.  
Two for you next to her.   
  
**Rani-K=spot:**  
As you command. Now let's try it.   
  
**B：Rani-K:**  
I see... It's&ndash;   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Wait! You don't need to give your opinion!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I already know how questionable this is compared to  
his cooking!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
This was just emergency provisions, or like,   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
a momentary diversion from the concept of cooking  
you're all so starved for...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Don't mind the taste, really.   
  
**Bhima:**  
That what you think? Tastes quite decent to me.  
(Munch)   
  
**F：Cerejeira:**  
GAAH!   
  
**F：Cerejeira:**  
Wh-when did you come back, Lancer!?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Just got here. And no sooner did I notice this great  
smell.   
  
**Bhima:**  
You're pretty decent, Master.   
  
**F：Cerejeira:**  
Enough flattery... Be honest with me...   
  
**Bhima:**  
But I was being honest. This stuff is decent.  
Plain, but not bad.   
  
**F：Cerejeira:**  
Compared to yours, “decent” means “ignorable”.   
  
**Bhima:**  
That's not how it works...   
  
**C：Rani-K:**  
Agreed. As I was ordered to not give an opinion,  
I'll give you only a score.   
  
**D：Rani-K:**  
By our combined evaluations, your dish scores  
231 points. Congratulations. It's a passing grade.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Kh... I can't react to that without knowing the average  
or max score.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I already suspected it'd be the case, but Master,  
you can cook when you try.   
  
**Bhima:**  
That's the biggest surprise to me.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Well... For whatever it's worth, I'm the prime Keep AI,  
supposedly. You've already seen me convert and  
process materials before.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I can cook. And that's as far as I go.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
And I knew my girls wanted their replenishment,  
no matter what the form.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
With them asking me to cook, I decided on a whim on  
doing this... Agh, enough.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I wouldn't have done a recipe this low-effort if I knew  
you were home.   
  
**B：Rani-K:**  
Thank you for the meal. I am replenished.   
  
**C：Rani-K:**  
Confirmed increase of the new status: “Satisfied with  
flavor”. It's not at a record value, but it was satisfying.   
  
**D：Rani-K:**  
I'd like to submit a full report analyzing and evaluating  
the particulars of what makes Lancer's and the  
leader's pieces different,   
  
**D：Rani-K:**  
but that death stare encourages me not to. Danger.   
  
**Bhima:**  
You cooked because they asked. And they're satisfied.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Nothing to feel bad about here.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I'm not sure on that one.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Fine. But I am.   
  
**Bhima:**  
By the way, why did you make each of them pour  
different powders on their plates?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
You saw that? Yeah, that was just some custom  
fine-tuning.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
What's best for a girl with fatigued legs is different for  
what's best for a girl with fatigued arms.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Since the taste would be middling anyways,  
I thought the food could at least have that going for it.   
  
**Bhima:**  
(For all her constant lack of confidence, she actually  
pays a lot of attention to her team.)   
  
**Bhima:**  
(Did she get these observation skills from her habit of  
keeping a diary?)   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
What's the dumb smile for?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Nothing. To be honest, you're better than I thought,  
Master.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Are you mocking me?   
  
**Bhima:**  
I mean it, 100%.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Oh look, there's still some food left in the pan.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Perfect, I hadn't snatched enough off of their plates.  
Don't mind if I eat all that!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Ah, stop. My cooking is worse than yours.  
Why would you&mdash;   
  
**Bhima:**  
Why would I care? Master, you put effort into this  
meal. Nothing can make it not special.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Hoho, I've never seen this vegetable before.   
  
**Bhima:**  
So that's what it tastes like. Is this the kind of stuff  
you like, Master? Uh-huh, the different flavors are well  
harmonized. I could eat this all day long.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
By the way... One more important question.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
What were you doing? Where have you been?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Oh, just popped out real quick to kill Caster's Master.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...Pardon?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Hold up, was that a joke or...?   
  
**Bhima:**  
No joke. I did it with my own hands. It was surprisingly  
easy. Don't know what happened to Caster himself,  
though.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
No way... No, you wouldn't lie about this. Then, really?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
In that case, uh, what was it...? Search rules&mdash;   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
What happens if a Master dies first in combat?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
By accessing the defeated Master's AI Core,   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
the winning Master can obtain their remaining  
Command Spell, if available, and the leadership rights  
to their partition&mdash;   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Hey...did you perhaps, grab some kind of core?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Hm? I won't mince words here. I didn't bother!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(Sigh) Of course not...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(What are in the implications of this, rule-wise?  
Isn't that super bad? How will the overseer...  
the general supervisor respond to it?)   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(Or is there an automatic fix in place?  
...I don't know...)   
  
**Bhima:**  
You look quite troubled. Your brows are furrowed  
deeper than ever.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Need some food too?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I'd never eat that. It's the last thing I want.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Hahaha! I know I'm the one who suggested, but yeah,  
your own food being what satisfied you would hurt my  
pride real bad.   
  
**Bhima:**  
All right, this was a great reference for the next recipe  
I'm about to develop!   
  
**Bhima:**  
My table prep got rid of your misgivings, so next time  
will be when I make something that reaches your heart!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(Misgivings. I'm filled with anxiety and guilt.)   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(Can anything seriously get rid of them...?)   
  
### Arrow 2  
  
**Ayus:**  
This goes here, cover this part...and done!  
All right, that's all. Now you just rest!   
  
**Rani-D=spot:**  
My thanks. I have a little to spare for you.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Really? You could have waited to pay when you were  
more well-off, but thank you!   
  
**Ayus:**  
&mdash;Okay, next please!   
  
**Ayus:**  
No need to walk. Just lie down and I'll come to you!   
  
**Ayus:**  
I'll shut down your mind for the treatment,  
but don't worry about it. Okay, here goes&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
Phew...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
You've done a lot.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
On a quick break? Good. I guarantee it will increase  
your work efficiency in the long run.   
  
**Sion:**  
You're better off leaving the treatments to the arrived  
R-type reinforcements for a while.   
  
**Ayus:**  
You two were also of great help.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Things turned out alright in the end, but with how big  
that mad monster was...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Yeah, there's a lot of damage... I can't help but sigh.   
  
**Kama:**  
Sure, but don't you find it better than doing nothing?   
  
**Sion:**  
True. You significantly minimized the damage.  
That much is evident.   
  
**Sion:**  
Before, you weren't even able to carry the AIs to  
places better suited for healing.   
  
**Ayus:**  
R-right. Still... Still...   
  
**Ayus:**  
It's so...stressful.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Fixing people's damage is Repair's duty, and I'd never  
complain about it,   
  
**Ayus:**  
but that doesn't mean I want anyone to get hurt.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hey...one thing that crossed my mind. Families are  
generally composed of people you care about, right?   
  
**Ayus:**  
So doesn't that mean that forming a family is giving  
yourself more people to care about?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
That's right.  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
I can imagine it. Someone I care about getting hurt...  
I can feel my stomach area cramping.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Once my wish is granted and we're all together in a  
family&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
It'll be even more stressful to see someone hurt than it  
is now.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Yeah... Probably.  
  
**Kama:**  
Hehehe. Took you long enough to notice. Yes,  
love and pain are two sides of the same coin.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
So you have to go out of your way to make sure no one gets hurt.  
  
**Kama:**  
Hehe, but that has its limits.   
  
**Kama:**  
Love and pain are two sides of the same coin.  
You can't escape that.   
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
You can only connect to others because of love,  
and their pain only reaches you because you're  
connected.   
  
**Kama:**  
That's an inescapable principle. Love hurts.   
  
**Kama:**  
So&mdash;what will you do about it?  
Are you giving up on familial love?   
  
**Ayus:**  
No. I don't wanna. I won't give up.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Families have their problems. Even so...or perhaps  
because of it,   
  
**Ayus:**  
I'll prepare myself to accept the bad parts,  
determined to withstand the pain, perfectly aware of  
the fact things can and will get rough at some point.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I really feel like...I need to find myself a family.   
  
**Kama:**  
If you say so.   
  
**Ayus:**  
&mdash;Break's over! Back to the healing spree!   
  
**Sion:**  
You didn't find the time for a breather until now,  
but the fact that you managed to force yourself to rest  
here...   
  
**Sion:**  
...must mean the number of people asking for help  
significantly decreased.   
  
**Sion:**  
Are we almost done with the emergency relief?   
  
**Ayus:**  
No, I think we still got a lot of girls in need of repairs.   
  
**Ayus:**  
But yeah... I think very few of them actively tried to  
contact Repair.   
  
**Sion:**  
Why would that be?   
  
**Ayus:**  
We AIs have a base routine of rewarding other AIs'  
services with Raniment.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I think the injured who were low on Raniment couldn't  
afford to ask for it.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Basically, even if they saw us, they couldn't afford to  
make a request for Repair.   
  
**Ayus:**  
It's not physically impossible, but it does require a lot  
of paperwork, which takes a while to process.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Which is why we have to reach out to them.  
It's a lot of work, but we have to&mdash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Got it, dolts? Now is not the time to take things slow.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Berserker! Where have you been all this time?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Doing what I had to.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You say healing must prioritize those who have  
Raniment and leave the rest for later?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That's not what a rightful nation looks like.  
I must correct this situation.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
As such! Yours truly created contract tokens for AIs.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
It's a compressed file containing a mutual agreement  
program saying they can pay the Raniment later.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You may distribute them so they reach those in need.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
With this, the poor won't need to hesitate to accept  
treatment.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Wh-what happened to you, Berserker!? Your idea is  
amazing, don't get me wrong, but did you hit your head  
or something!?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You dolt, I just did what any royal would!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Did you not hear yours truly always telling you I'm a  
wise commander?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I saw the chance to prove it and I took it.  
Fret not, hahahahahaha!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Either way, having this will increase the relief speed.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I'll hand it over to the Repair girls and take it to those  
in need!   
  
**Ayus:**  
All right, things are about get busy! My repair spirit is  
pumped!   
  
**Kama:**  
Sorry to interrupt the armchair tactician's feel-good  
moment, but...   
  
**Sion:**  
This contract token contains a fine-print agreement  
for paying the base cost plus 40% interest.   
  
**Sion:**  
Did I read this line correctly?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...  
...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
YOU DON'T SAY!?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
You're not fooling anyone...  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
How much of a money-worshipper do you have to be  
to exploit moments of weakness with an unfair  
contract?   
  
**Sion:**  
The barely reasonable interest rate is the nastiest  
part.   
  
**Kama:**  
How can you be this trashy of a person?  
That's horribly Duryodhana of you.   
  
**Kama:**  
But oh well, the way you already have one foot  
unsalvageably sunk into decadence is lovely to me.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Wait, did you just nonchalantly use my name as an  
insult?   
  
**Sion:**  
...(Sigh) You did make a fool out of yourself.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Wh-what's wrong with it? Fairness and equality are  
not the same thing!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Those who do special things are deserving of special  
benefits!   
  
**Sion:**  
That aside,   
  
**Sion:**  
while she hadn't noticed when she was with us,  
as the prime AI,   
  
**Sion:**  
Ayus will soon realize the contract token's mechanism.   
  
**Sion:**  
She should be easily able to overwrite and correct it.   
  
**Sion:**  
I say you're a fool for not imagining her opinions and  
reaction,   
  
**Sion:**  
regarding the act of exploiting injured people under  
duress.   
  
**A：Ayus' voice approaching:**  
BERSERKER! What's the meaning of this!?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hmm...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
She must be very busy, therefore I can't imagine her  
dropping everything to discipline me.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
With that, I'll be making my escape for the moment!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I trust all of you to give her a nice-sounding  
justification! You can say that...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
In worry for my Master's overwork, my excessive  
kindness drove me to want to give her  
fair compensation.   
  
**Sion:**  
What a good-for-nothing he is. He's everything the  
rumors said.   
  
**Kama:**  
I'm quite fond of him. He's the very image of humanity,  
so easy to corrupt.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
He's just someone true to his desires.  
  
**Sion:**  
Yes. Very predictable.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
He's charming. I can't dislike his antics.  
  
**Sion:**  
This sort of evaluation doesn't fall within my  
jurisdiction...   
  
**Sion:**  
But I can't deny I have a sort of psychological  
affection for him. Is this a variant of the Charisma Skill?   
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Ultimately, the best way to sum him up is as...  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Huff) (Huff)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Agh. I got a tear in my favorite sash.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Was it because I ran too much or because of all the  
fighting? Darn.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I need Raniment to knit a new one. No can do.  
I have to fold this part so one can see it... Hm?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hey, you there.   
  
**Rani-G:**  
...?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I can't stand to see you there about to collapse.  
This dangling arm of yours bothers me.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Is it broken? What an eyesore&mdash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...Hmph. I'll give you this sash. Use it to prop up your  
broken arm. Now go look for a Repair member and give  
her this token.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Huh? Raniment, you say?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I was never expecting to make money off someone as  
obviously poor as you. That's what this token is for.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Just get out of my sight already. I'm quite busy.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Well, the contract might be rewritten, but it won't go  
to waste if we can at least earn the usual amount later.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Besides...yeah.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I was aiming to throw away that worn out sash and  
get a new one anyways&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
He might be a generally bad person,  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
but I wouldn't say he's all bad...  
  
---  
  
### Arrow 3 Pre-Battle  
  
**Sion:**  
Those seem to be B-types... Build AIs. They're  
reconstructing the wrecked structures.   
  
**Sion:**  
We're done repairing people, and now we enter the  
phase of repairing the city.   
  
**Sion:**  
Perhaps it's almost time to disassemble this field  
hospital of ours.   
  
**DX:**  
...Negative. I believe it will be necessary to keep it here  
for a while longer.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Hello, DX.  
  
**Sion:**  
Prime Defend AI. What need to keep it here are you  
talking about?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Why can't we leave yet?  
  
---  
  
**DX:**  
Answer: To maintain the status quo while the  
defenders are in a difficult state of affairs.   
  
**DX:**  
There's no guarantee regular threats won't appear  
before the injured. It is necessary to protect them,   
  
**DX:**  
but currently, we are running on a low number  
of D-types. Many D-types are damaged.   
  
**DX:**  
In this situation where the subjects of protection are  
gathered together, it is possible to cover for our lower  
headcount... Excuse me.   
  
**DX:**  
D-type communications alerted me of a regular  
threat&mdash;bugs are occurring.  
Due to our lack of personnel, this unit must head to  
the scene.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sounds like your hands are full.  
  
**Sion:**  
I can see in your eyes that you'll follow this up with  
“We can help you.” No objections from me.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
We have less to do here now, so we'll help you.  
  
---  
  
**DX:**  
...My thanks.   
  
**Kama:**  
Sure, fine by me, there's nothing else for us to do here  
other than the healing part only Ayus' team can do.   
  
**Kama:**  
By the way, what were you doing during the big lug's  
rampage?   
  
**Kama:**  
Despite being the boss of security, you sure didn't  
show your face.   
  
**DX:**  
I report that I was in front of the church, on duty of  
guarding the general supervisor. Understand that it was  
a special mission of highest priority.   
  
**Kama:**  
Huh. Well, I can believe that.   
  
**Kama:**  
It's only natural for the ones on top to have a stronger  
will to protect themselves and no one else.   
  
**DX:**  
Correction: This was not a request of the general  
supervisor, merely a necessity of the system.   
  
**Kama:**  
Sure thing, what a devoted little working doll she is.  
Let's get going already.   
  
**DX:**  
Malignant data located. Resolving issue with  
collaborators.   
  
**DX:**  
Engage&mdash;   
  
### Arrow 3 Post-Battle  
  
**DX:**  
Concluded.   
  
**Kama:**  
Sooo weak! Did we really need to help?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Better safe than sorry.  
  
---  
  
**DX:**  
Pardon. Another threat reported in a different block.  
A place belonging to the Grow area.   
  
**DX:**  
This unit plans to head there immediately.   
  
**Sion:**  
We'll help. We already started, so we might as well  
keep going.   
  
**DX:**  
Thank you again. This unit will lead you there&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hey, wait up! Where are you going?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Huh? Weren't you busy?  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Not as much now.   
  
**Ayus:**  
But I realized later that this isn't the only place with  
injured AIs.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Some girls must have fled to Grow, so I thought I had  
to at least check there.   
  
**Sion:**  
Great timing. We're heading to Grow right now for  
pest control.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Perfect. I'll be going with you!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Nothing beats earnest work. You can't go around  
making shady contracts!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
C'mon, I already learned my lesson.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(She put him on the leash...)  
  
---  
  
**Narration:**  
Things are proceeding without a hitch, as is desirable.   
  
**Narration:**  
Matters require more time for now.   
  
**Narration:**  
Until he has adapted.  
Until the new personality starts operating.   
  
**Narration:**  
It won't take long.   
  
**Narration:**  
Soon the Holy Grail War will resume.  
It must.   
  
**Narration:**  
The one light I seek is at its end.  
My reason for employing the Holy Grail War.   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;For the sake of my love.   
  
### Arrow 4 Pre-Battle  
  
**Lainur:**  
Alright, this should be the place. Lemme off the horse.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Aye.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Let's see. Where are we? The coordinates  
indicate&mdash;a little more over here.   
  
**Lainur:**  
That's it. Okay, now we bury this here and...   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
...  
...   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Master.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Yeah. I can tell.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Is that so? Then I shall await your orders.   
  
**Lainur:**  
(Yeah, I figured he wouldn't autonomously try to  
defeat them. Is he lazy or...no, it's something else.)   
  
**Lainur:**  
Those ain't bugs. They're those shades that've been  
popping up lately.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Definitely not somethin' I want to deal with alone.  
Exterminate them, Rider.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
...As you wish.   
  
**Lainur:**  
(That should be inconspicuous enough... Was I right?)   
  
### Arrow 4 Post-Battle  
  
**Lainur:**  
Aha. Feels like I'm starting to see what's goin' on.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Most likely, these dudes really are just spawnin' in at  
random. Though of course, there's gotta be somethin'  
causing it.   
  
**Lainur:**  
And then the question is just what that is?   
  
**Lainur:**  
So, I'll try matchin' it with the coordinate elements I'd  
been workin' on originally, aaand...   
  
**Lainur:**  
Hmm... Oddly, that might actually be correspondin'  
pretty well, huh?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Still, gonna need more info if I wanna be sure.   
  
**Lainur:**  
A'right, done here for now. Get me to the next point.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Understood.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
...  
...   
  
**Lainur:**  
Heheheh...well, since you ain't gonna ask unless I tell  
ya, guess I gotta do it myself.  
“What are you doing,” right?   
  
**Lainur:**  
It's what it looks like&ndash;I'm makin' a map.  
Well, somethin' LIKE a map, would be more accurate.   
  
**Lainur:**  
A'right, I'll allow it&ndash;Ask me what you didn't get  
from my explanation just now.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Why a map?   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Is the geographic data of this world not already  
installed in you, given that you are one of its prime AIs?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Good question&mdash;right, you don't like those kinda  
compliments, do ya?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Let's call it a natural question, then. It is kinda the  
obvious thing to ask, after all.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
...  
...   
  
**Lainur:**  
Answer's simple&ndash;yes, this map has no meaning.   
  
**Lainur:**  
But that doesn't mean it ain't important.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I'm not lookin' at the geography, but the  
functions&ndash;like, why is this world shaped like this?   
  
**Lainur:**  
What MEANING is there to the world bein' shaped like  
this?   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
This witless blade has no way of knowing.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Hah, you sure seem happy putting it like that.  
Well, well.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Anyway, feels like I'll be able to find out more if I  
match it with more of these “shades”.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Don't know if its gonna be sunny or rainy that day,  
but I'm done sending the future the fireworks I'm  
plannin' on firing anyway.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Probably gonna be able to move about more freely  
from now on.   
  
**Lainur:**  
It's better to be on horse than bike when you're  
moving around surveyin'.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Damn nice that you were a Rider with a steed.  
I'll be counting on the assistance, eh?   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
As you wish.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Being treated as a mere loyal steed is in accord with  
my wishes as well.   
  
**Lainur:**  
You're a weird guy, gotta say. Though, awesome to  
have an assistant, so no complaints here.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
That is simply how I am.   
  
**Narration:**  
That's how I am? What a laughable notion.   
  
**Narration:**  
His face ever the mask, he ponders&ndash;he questions  
himself.   
  
**Narration:**  
Who am I?   
  
**Narration:**  
Ever since he was summoned, he has constantly held  
those doubts within.   
  
**Narration:**  
Gao Changgong. Warrior. Qi Dynasty. General.  
Masked hero&mdash;Prince of Lanling.   
  
**Narration:**  
All fact. All true.   
  
**Narration:**  
However... Right now, he feels a complete aversion  
toward what he would become.   
  
**Narration:**  
He can never be like that. As long as he doesn't,  
everything is in order.   
  
**Narration:**  
Nevertheless, the rest of him cannot see how his path  
would ever not lead him there.   
  
**Narration:**  
It all leads there. Therefore, he has to cut off that path  
right now.   
  
**Narration:**  
He has to leave the lowly Gao Changgong where he is  
now, as far away as possible, and cut it off.   
  
**Narration:**  
As such, he is no warrior&ndash;he is no general&ndash;  
he is no masked hero.   
  
**Narration:**  
He has sworn that he would do anything for this  
paltry cause of never advancing forward, even evil.   
  
**Narration:**  
He is...  
Simply a coward.   
  
### Arrow 5 Pre-Battle  
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;Who am I?   
  
**Narration:**  
That's a question repeated many times over in the  
past.   
  
**Narration:**  
Before I was summoned into this world.  
When I lived on that shapeless island.   
  
**Narration:**  
I never was a hero. I am a threat to humanity.  
An anti-hero.   
  
**Narration:**  
For that reason, I'm a monstress imbued with multiple  
meanings.   
  
**Narration:**  
But what version of me is the version here carrying the  
golden sword?   
  
**Narration:**  
What do I care about? What do I wish?  
What do I fear? What do I seek?   
  
**Narration:**  
What do I like most?  
What do I dread most?   
  
**Narration:**  
I know the answer.  
I carry myself the way I do because I know.   
  
**Narration:**  
I know&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
She should never have summoned me.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I brought the concrete materials for construction.  
I'll leave them here.   
  
**C：Rani-B:**  
Thank you.   
  
**B：Rani-B:**  
Extremely delighted.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I don't need your gratitude. I was just following  
Saku&ndash;the prime AI's orders.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
...Report: Diagnosis concluded.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
No problems were found in your capabilities for  
continued activity, but considering you're a Master,   
  
**Rani-R:**  
you're in a state that demands attention.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
I recommend asking our prime Repair AI for advice.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Would you like me to call her through the R-type  
comms?   
  
**Sakura:**  
No, it's fine. I don't need to go that far.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Why is that?   
  
**Sakura:**  
It's a bit...complex.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I know myself best.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I feel like that's not an issue that talking to her can  
necessarily solve.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
&mdash;I don't disagree.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
It is possible that the problem lies outside the domain  
of our healing capabilities.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
I'd say you couldn't be in this state otherwise.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Right? Then all I'd be doing is cause unnecessary  
stress and worry on her.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I can't burden someone like that after saving my life.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Also&mdash;hehe, I have one more, simpler reason.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I want to always try my best even if I'm ultimately  
disqualified...   
  
**Sakura:**  
Yes. It's a simple matter of ego.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
...  
...   
  
**Sakura:**  
So please keep quiet about this.  
Don't tell Ayus...or Saber.   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Of course. We have a confidentiality duty ensuring  
every patient's privacy.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I'm back... How were the exam results?   
  
**Sakura:**  
No problems found. Nothing stopping me from  
returning to my regular activities.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Right?   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Right... Back to your regular activities.   
  
**Medusa:**  
That's great news.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I'm done helping Build. Any more work for me?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Nothing urgent... I suppose that's all for now.   
  
**Sakura:**  
&mdash;Thank you, Saber.   
  
**Medusa:**  
It's nothing. It's expected of my position to do what  
I'm told, and so I did.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Sure, that's what you think, but I'm honestly grateful.   
  
**Sakura:**  
It's because of you fighting for us that we managed to  
come back to Grow.   
  
**Sakura:**  
It's unfortunately true that we have fewer hands and  
lost a few facilities,   
  
**Sakura:**  
but the G-types can all live here again.   
  
**Sakura:**  
We can keep sowing our seeds forever.  
I'm happy for it.   
  
**Medusa:**  
(That's not true, Sakura.)   
  
**Medusa:**  
(It's because of the Holy Grail War that this place you  
are so eager to protect got destroyed to begin with.)   
  
**Medusa:**  
(It was destroyed because we Servants exist.  
We brought this threat. You can't forget that.)   
  
**Medusa:**  
(We can't be credited for solving problems we're  
responsible for. Culpable, even. And for you to hold  
gratitude for it?)   
  
**Medusa:**  
(How are you so&mdash;?)   
  
**Medusa:**  
...  
...   
  
**Sakura:**  
Oh, I almost forgot! I'm thinking of giving you a special  
reward whenever I can afford it.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Give me some time, Saber. Can you come with me?   
  
**Medusa:**  
I don't need any rewards.   
  
**Medusa:**  
...But I'm in no position to refuse. I'll go wherever you  
want.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Here we are. Hehehe, what do you think this place is?   
  
**Medusa:**  
A hill. It's a great point of overlook.  
I can quite easily spot incoming enemies.   
  
**Medusa:**  
But conversely, it makes us more vulnerable to snipers.   
  
**Medusa:**  
And all those trees behind us obstruct my view.  
That gives the opposite worries from&mdash;   
  
**Sakura:**  
Oh, c'mon.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Yes, it is a good point of overlook.   
  
**Sakura:**  
This is my personal favorite place, a secret spot with  
the best view of the Grow partition.   
  
**Sakura:**  
The breeze feels great here, so I thought you'd enjoy  
it too, Saber...   
  
**Medusa:**  
...  
...   
  
**Medusa:**  
Yeah. It's not a bad place.   
  
**Sakura:**  
R-right? Great. Oh, you can sit here.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Doesn't it feel just like an arbor, with this Production  
Tree for fruit-type materials serving as the roof?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Let's relax here.   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
Saber...I know you've seen the outside world.   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
Sorry if this artificial scenery feels bleak compared to  
what you know. The thought only now hit me.   
  
**Q：Medusa:**  
You're really late to the realization.  
Everywhere in this world is artificial.   
  
**Q：Medusa:**  
Besides&mdash;   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
...  
...   
  
**Q：Medusa:**  
The island where I lived was also quite bleak,  
I feel like. I still prefer here to there.   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
R-really?   
  
**Q：Medusa:**  
Probably. I don't remember it clearly.   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
Tell me more about it. We haven't had the chance to  
talk about it until now.   
  
**Q：Medusa:**  
Didn't I just tell you I don't remember?   
  
**Q：Medusa:**  
All I can remember is...my sisters.   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
Oh, but that's good enough. Perfect!   
  
**Q：Medusa:**  
Why are you clinging so much to this? It's a pointless  
story. Knowing about it won't do you any good.   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
True, I suppose I was too excited. I wonder why?  
Hmm...   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
I guess because...you're the first person I met who's  
like me.   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
People the same age range, gender, and status...   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
They normally chat like this, no?   
  
**Q：Medusa:**  
...  
...   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
I truly am an AI.   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
Conversation is nothing more to me than a basic  
function born out of necessity.   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
The ordinary AIs, both in Grow and elsewhere,  
are all great girls, but they're built to do what I say.   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
It's not an equal relationship.   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
That's why you're the first opportunity to be with  
someone I don't know...I think?   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
So I have like, a desire to learn, which makes me want  
to interact even if our conversations are pointless.   
  
**Q：Medusa:**  
Your explanation does nothing to me. I'm not an AI.   
  
**R：Sakura:**  
Y-yeah, you aren't. Sorry for being weird.   
  
**Narration:**  
She knew all along that this was actually pointless  
and not something she should be doing.   
  
**Narration:**  
But...   
  
**Narration:**  
Seeing her bashful face,   
  
**Narration:**  
the inorganic wind blowing in this desolate place  
resembles the breezes of my homeland.   
  
**Narration:**  
Am I getting delirious?   
  
**Sakura:**  
(She sat down. Does that mean...?)   
  
**Medusa:**  
We can talk about anything, right?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Y-yeah! I'm personally interested in your comment  
about your sisters, but yes, anything!   
  
**Medusa:**  
I'd rather not risk talking about my sisters...  
It could get us cursed.   
  
**Sakura:**  
R-really?   
  
**Medusa:**  
Maybe.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Then why don't you tell me about your homeland?   
  
**Medusa:**  
That's okay... Though I think it's going to be a boring  
story&mdash;   
  
**Medusa:**  
...  
...   
  
**Medusa:**  
By the way, I've been wondering. What's this box?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Huh? AH&mdash;I've been enjoying the talk so much  
that I forgot about it.   
  
**Sakura:**  
This is...what's the word for it? Right, basket!  
This is a basket!   
  
**Sakura:**  
We go to a place with a beautiful view, chat,  
and to top it off, eat the meal in the basket together.   
  
**Sakura:**  
My data says that this recreation is called a picnic.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I was thinking of giving this package to you as a  
thank-you gift, Saber,   
  
**Sakura:**  
but I got so happy with our chat that I forgot about it.   
  
**Sakura:**  
This basket contains materials processed by Keep.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I made a little arrangements of my own, resulting in  
items close to the ones called “sandwiches”.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I made a bunch so we can we eat together!   
  
**Medusa:**  
I suppose I'll have to bite the bullet.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Hm. My sandwiches don't have bullets in them.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Don't mind me. I didn't mean it like that.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Without further ado...   
  
**Medusa:**  
Did you hear that? Is someone fighting nearby?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Oh no. Let's go take a look!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sakura and Saber...!?  
  
---  
  
**Medusa:**  
The Berserker and Assassin teams. And you're&mdash;-  
Defend.   
  
**DX:**  
Pardon, we are on duty. This is unrelated to the Holy  
Grail War.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Bugs, right? We can help too.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Don't worry. Eradicating pests approaching the crops  
is part of my usual duties.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Heya&mdash;Let's get going!   
  
### Arrow 5 Post-Battle  
  
**Sakura:**  
(Phew. We managed it...)   
  
**Sakura:**  
(As I imagined, they aren't that big a deal.)   
  
**DX:**  
Thank you for your cooperation.   
  
**Sakura:**  
You're welcome. Pest control is part of my regular  
duties,   
  
**Sakura:**  
so it wouldn't feel right to let someone else do it.   
  
**Sakura:**  
It's only natural for me to help where I can.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Though most of the time, when something big comes  
up, I'm the one calling Defend for help.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Anyways, this time I just happened to be nearby.   
  
**Sakura:**  
And you six helped too.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I'm sorry for not getting the chance to thank you  
properly after we got rid of Caster's monsters...   
  
**Sakura:**  
I was hopelessly worried about this partition.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
It's perfectly fine.  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
This place is pretty far into the outskirts of Grow,  
isn't it?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Are you sure you aren't overextending yourself,  
managing all the way over here with your own eyes?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Ah, today I wasn't exactly here for management...  
I just happened to...   
  
**Sakura:**  
Well, my favorite resting spot is around here.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Would you like to join me there, if you don't mind  
taking a break?   
  
**Sakura:**  
You can take your time to recharge there, and we have  
a picnic basket.   
  
**Sakura:**  
It's alright, I've made enough for everyone!   
  
**Kama:**  
What's your call? I'm fine with either option.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I don't care if it's the Raniment of the grateful  
D-types or the edible maintenance materials.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I just need any form of immediate compensation for  
my work right now. Or else they'll forget me!   
  
**DX:**  
My squadron is still on duty. We'll be going separate  
ways.   
  
**DX:**  
However, all remaining targets have been identified as  
minor. You can rest without worry.   
  
**DX:**  
This unit will transfer the cooperative Raniment fee  
immediately. We are grateful for your help.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Then don't mind if I do.  
  
---  
  
**Sakura:**  
Err, sorry, Saber.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I got caught in my need to thank them and didn't think  
about you...   
  
**Medusa:**  
What are you apologizing for?   
  
**Medusa:**  
I don't agree on us getting too close with them,  
but I'd never argue against your decisions.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Because I'm just your Servant&mdash;   
  
### Arrow 6  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Give me more, don't be stingy!   
  
**Medusa:**  
Wait. Can't you show at least a little bit of restraint?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hell no. Why would yours truly, a royal and the  
strongest warrior, need restraint?   
  
**Medusa:**  
You're abusing Sakura's cordiality... I guess I'll have to  
kill you.   
  
**Sakura:**  
D-don't, Saber.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Munch) (Munch) (Munch) (Munch) (Munch)   
  
**Kama:**  
Do you really need to eat with all this hurry?  
You got crumbs all over your cheeks.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Offers his cheek)   
  
**Kama:**  
(Silently gets in position to launch the Vajra)   
  
**Ayus:**  
Okay, I'll clean it. Ugh, you're such a baby.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Him eating looks like the very image of happiness.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Him eating looks like a joyful child.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Well... A person's sleeping face or eating face reveal  
nothing about their dispositions. He could potentially  
trick people with this.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Burp) All right, I've had enough.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Not a nice thing to say after you kept grabbing  
everything you wanted!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
It's true that I wanted all of this, but never that I'd  
have everything. You can eat it, as much as you please.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
If that's not enough for you, ask for more. You have to  
eat to grow yourself taller!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
By the way, this Saber over there is the height limit,  
got it? If you get any bigger, people might think you're  
a waste of space.   
  
**Medusa:**  
That's it, I'll kill him.   
  
**Sakura:**  
C-calm down.   
  
**Narration:**  
I'm sure that's really weird of me,   
  
**Narration:**  
but I catch myself thinking.   
  
**Narration:**  
Who am I?   
  
**Narration:**  
The Prime Grow AI. A Master in the AI Holy Grail War.  
The name she gave me was&mdash;Sakura.   
  
**Narration:**  
I'm here because I have a role.   
  
**Narration:**  
To recover the system's functions, we must fight the  
AI Holy Grail War and stimulate the circulation of  
Raniment.   
  
**Narration:**  
And yet I...strangely enough, grew to want something  
else.   
  
**Narration:**  
These times of peace.  
And this home that enables them.   
  
**Narration:**  
I get intrusive thoughts about how I don't want to lose  
this.   
  
**Narration:**  
That must be my wish.  
The wish I must win the battle to obtain.   
  
**Narration:**  
But what if that's something I can get without winning?   
  
**Narration:**  
What if I could just naturally build relationships like I'm  
doing right now on this breezy hill?   
  
**Narration:**  
Maybe there's no need to fight.   
  
**Narration:**  
Am I a coward? Am I defective? I don't know.   
  
**Narration:**  
But I know that for some reason, I just want to protect  
the place I call home.   
  
**Narration:**  
Am I the only one?   
  
**Narration:**  
Will someone in the same position laugh at me if I talk  
about this?   
  
**Narration:**  
What do we even&mdash;have wishes for in the first  
place?   
  
**Medusa:**  
Sakura.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Uh?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Oh, wait!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...?  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Eh, I don't think this is about us. I can't sense Lancer's  
presence here either.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...  
...   
  
**Sakura:**  
Anything the matter, Cerejeira?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Not really...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I just wanted to ask what happened.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I know Lancer went to do something while I wasn't  
looking.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Could it be that it was Lancer who killed Caster's  
Master...?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Probably.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
And you're the only person I thought would know  
what happened and...who I'm already comfortable  
enough talking to.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Is that so?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Then I've got you and Lancer to thank.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Yes, it's thanks to you that the monster disappeared.  
You saved Grow. We got our first collaborative work  
done before I even knew it.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Ah, I'm just in the middle of a...sort of a picnic to  
thank everyone for that.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Join us, Cerejeira. We can&ndash;   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I won't.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
That...buddy-buddy atmosphere of the picnic.  
It's not for me. I can't...   
  
**Sakura:**  
But it makes me so happy. I'm sure my wish is  
something like that.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...My wish isn't.   
  
**Sakura:**  
What's your wish, Cerejeira?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Knowing it won't do you any good. But okay, I'll tell.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I'm plagued by something beyond my comprehension.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
This guilt in my heart. My wish is to fix it.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Anything I do only makes it stronger...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
So I don't wanna be happy. I don't wanna taste  
anything good.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I don't wanna win. Yes, I...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I just want someone to kill me.  
I want punishment&mdash;I think.   
  
**Sakura:**  
...!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Aha...I finally got that out. I must be broken if I'm  
thinking stuff like this.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
See? I'm not like you.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
So I can't join you.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Wai&ndash;   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...! Hey, are you...?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...   
  
**Medusa:**  
Sakura... Sorry, I didn't make it in time.   
  
**Sakura:**  
It's fine. So you were watching from a distance,  
weren't you? Thank you.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Look at me, tripping over my feet on a failed dash.  
How embarrassing.   
  
**Medusa:**  
...Are you okay?   
  
**Sakura:**  
I am. Look at my pose of health and energy. Heya!   
  
**Sakura:**  
It seems like she's not a fan of picnics. I can't force  
her to join in, so I guess I have to let her go.   
  
**Narration:**  
I wish for peace to come as naturally as this breeze.   
  
**Narration:**  
But I know it's not meant to last.   
  
**Narration:**  
There's nothing natural about this peace.  
The wind will eventually stop blowing.   
  
**Narration:**  
Never to blow again&mdash;   
  
**Bhima:**  
Yo, back already? You could have taken your sweet  
time out there.   
  
**Bhima:**  
...What's wrong? You look terrible.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Nothing. I'm the same as always.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Sure hope you are. And so, how are we?  
Found any new information?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Yeah... Just as we thought, Caster's giant monster  
disappeared because of what you did.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Other than that, just&mdash;   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Hm?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Lancer! What's that?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Oh come on, what the hell?  
This wasn't supposed to happen&mdash;   
  
**Medusa:**  
Stay close to me, Sakura!   
  
**Sakura:**  
Why... Why!?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Why are they here again&mdash;?   
  
## Section 8: Malignant Reboot/fireworks(not starmine)  
  
### Arrow 1 Pre-Battle  
  
**Narration:**  
Reboot in progress.  
98%&mdash;99%&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
Implementation of a program to verify modified  
parameters.   
  
**Narration:**  
Basic properties...unmodified.   
  
**Narration:**  
Inherent faculties...adjusted. Visual appearance...  
fine-tuned. Ethical boundaries...adjusted. Name...  
unmodified.   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;  
&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
Final verification process. Once the virtual presentation  
concludes: pose question.   
  
**Narration:**  
“Who art thou”&mdash;?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
These things again!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
But...don't they seem different from before?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
How!? Caster should be long since gone...!   
  
**Kama:**  
Whatever the case, they're undeniably back again.  
Stay behind me, Master!   
  
**Sakura:**  
You seem to all be in one piece still. (Puffing)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hm, I figured this was part of your scheming.   
  
**Medusa:**  
That's my line.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Come on, this isn't the time to be bickering like that!   
  
**Ayus:**  
We need to team up and eliminate them, or more  
people are going to get hurt! Get it!?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Got it!  
  
---  
  
[Battle]  
  
### Arrow 2 Pre-Battle  
  
**Medusa:**  
Tch...these guys...?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Those “shades” are back again! But, something's not  
right...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Whaa!?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Ngh, they've become way stronger this time around...!   
  
**F：???:**  
...(Squeak)...(Chirp)...   
  
**Kama:**  
I'm not sure what, but there's definitely “something”  
nasty lurking within.   
  
**Kama:**  
Well, it doesn't change what we have to do.   
  
**Sion:**  
Right. There seems to be no indication that they are  
hostile toward the worm fiends. It's safe to assume  
they're part of the same forces.   
  
**Sion:**  
Don't stop cutting them down!   
  
### Arrow 2 Post-Battle  
  
**Ayus:**  
Phew, we're finally able to catch a break.   
  
**Sakura:**  
But what about elsewhere...and everyone else!?   
  
**Sakura:**  
I'm so sorry, I&mdash;   
  
**Kama:**  
Hey, I get how you feel, but this isn't the time for rash  
moves.   
  
**Kama:**  
The same goes for Master.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Mumbling)... Found you! Show yourself!   
  
**???:**  
Geheheh... It wasn't my intention to hide from you.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Wh-who's there!?   
  
**???:**  
“Who,” you ask? I believe I was asked that not long ago.  
Yes, I will answer you the same.   
  
**???:**  
I am the prime Build AI. A Master partaking in the AI  
Holy Grail War.   
  
**???:**  
My name&mdash;   
  
**???:**  
Makiri Zolgen.   
  
**Makiri:**  
&mdash;A magus.   
  
**Narration:**  
Though the intervention might have been rather  
high-handed,   
  
**Narration:**  
the Holy Grail War will resume.  
And so it must.   
  
**Narration:**  
In the end, there exists only one solution to strive  
towards.  
The reason behind the operations of the Holy Grail  
War.   
  
**Narration:**  
For the sake of carrying out the AEC Method.   
  
### Arrow 3 Pre-Battle  
  
**Kama:**  
His name might be the same, but he's all wrinkles now.   
  
**Kama:**  
How come?   
  
**Makiri:**  
Geheheh. Masters are recycled if their jurisdiction  
isn't properly taken away...it seems.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Perhaps by some partial work of the randomizer,  
I am reborn as a version of me different from who I  
was before.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Furthermore, you neglected to check if Caster's Spirit  
Core was truly crushed, did you not?   
  
**Makiri:**  
Such negligence. Though he was all but killed,  
he extended his survival at the moment that mattered,   
  
**Makiri:**  
allowing him to be utilized again like this. Servants  
need no minds in the first place, don't you know?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Caster too...!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Search&mdash;run&mdash;  
Result located.   
  
**Sion:**  
The overseer Rani XII declared: “Termination of  
functions for the Master of Caster.”   
  
**Sion:**  
And “I've confirmed Caster's Supersized Worm  
Fiend's erasure.”   
  
**Sion:**  
But she didn't state what happened to Caster himself.  
We simply made an assumption.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
WHAT!? Did that bitch scam us?   
  
**Sion:**  
(Her information was accurate but insufficient&mdash;)   
  
**Sion:**  
(Did she word it like that intentionally, or does the  
system mandate such phrasing?)   
  
**Sion:**  
(Things look very different depending on which is the  
answer...)   
  
**Kama:**  
Oh? But isn't Caster a bit strange?   
  
**Kama:**  
I mean, sure, it makes sense with how the old man  
said he was all but killed.   
  
**Kama:**  
But is he really thinking they can win the rematch all  
staggering like that?   
  
**Makiri:**  
Geheh. I have awakened to a new ability with my  
reboot.   
  
**Makiri:**  
You'd better not assume I am still on the level of my  
younger self.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Insects...!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Be careful.   
  
**Sion:**  
He is utilizing Raniment to cast Codes. Those are  
virtual spells no different from the outside world's  
magecraft.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Heheh, geheh. Great. Terrible. Great. Terrible.  
My head is now unclouded.   
  
**Makiri:**  
I cannot contain myself.   
  
**Makiri:**  
My younger self had so much more he could have  
done.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Such as trying to fuse Caster's familiars with insects  
like this.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Or parasitizing any of those empowered scrap  
structures swaggering around the world to control  
them...   
  
**Sion:**  
I see. He's more powerful than ever thanks to the  
terrifying Codes he can cast.   
  
**Sion:**  
His functions fail the basics of beauty and theatrics.  
As my father would put it, he only produces 0/10  
scenes that would be cut from the performance.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Hahahaha! Who cares about beauty?   
  
**Makiri:**  
My younger self let the silliest things hold him back.   
  
**Makiri:**  
He let a higher ideal consume his mind and failed to  
discard the last shreds of good within him.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Filled with the vanity of youth, he tried to win  
elegantly, and that is why he lost.   
  
**Makiri:**  
I am not like him.   
  
**Makiri:**  
I know that when the time comes, you must offer all  
that you have, no matter how hideous the result makes  
you.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Not for the distant ideal, but for the victory  
realistically within your grasp.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Especially at times like this, where the toy you can use  
is already at its breaking point&mdash;   
  
**Bluebeard:**  
Gh...gha, Ah...!   
  
**Sion:**  
Unbelievable, he filled his own Servant with bugs!   
  
**Makiri:**  
What use would he have if he wasn't sufficiently filled?   
  
**Makiri:**  
And...yes, I shall hold nothing back. It is all or nothing.   
  
**Makiri:**  
With this Command Spell, I order you!   
  
**Makiri:**  
Use its power as fuel to fill yourself and open now the  
doors to the secret room once again.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Then eat one another to expand, my worms and bugs,  
inexhaustible taboos!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Oh man... This again?   
  
**Makiri:**  
Heheheh, geheheheh...   
  
**Makiri:**  
Combined, Caster, his Noble Phantasm, and myself  
connected through insects can operate more freely  
than ever.   
  
**Makiri:**  
He loses the weakness of having the Master targeted,  
for I am here within him...!   
  
**Makiri:**  
This is an invincible Servant. Now you can become the  
sustenance that will lead me to my truth!   
  
**Medusa:**  
Sakura!   
  
**Sakura:**  
I'll give you Raniment, Saber.  
So, sorry to ask, but please&mdash;   
  
**Sakura:**  
Protect my home&mdash;   
  
[Battle]  
  
### Arrow 4  
  
**Makiri:**  
Geheheh, what's wrong? Can't take any more?   
  
**Kama:**  
Ah hell, shut up...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...  
...   
  
**Ayus:**  
No one finds running away to be manly, Berserker!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I...I know that!   
  
**Medusa:**  
Sakura!   
  
**Medusa:**  
Guh... Sakura, you...!   
  
**Sakura:**  
S-sorry, but...I just can't. I can't lose my home.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I already have nothing else in me.   
  
**Sakura:**  
By my Command Spell, I order you.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Use all of me. Saber, I beg you, protect my home...   
  
**Medusa:**  
Sakura! This is no time for&mdash;!   
  
**Makiri:**  
Oh, she let loose her Command Spell. But it's a little  
too late. You should have used it before this even  
began.   
  
**Makiri:**  
What you require is an “output” capable of blowing me  
away in one shot.   
  
**Makiri:**  
And by the looks of it, this isn't that kind of  
enhancement.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Are you really so starved for resources that the best  
you can produce to even continue the fight is a bunker...?   
  
**Sion:**  
(He's definitely not wrong. He hit the mark about  
what we need. But we don't have the sort of “guns” that  
will induce such output.)   
  
**Sion:**  
(Kama just isn't that kind of Servant&mdash;)   
  
**Sion:**  
(And even if Ayus were to use her Command Spell,)   
  
**Sion:**  
(Duryodhana's Noble Phantasm, with its greater  
range, is probably not the kind that's possible to  
concentrate on a single point.)   
  
**Sion:**  
(What are we going to do...!?)   
  
**Makiri:**  
I see you scrambling amidst your own thoughts,  
but it won't change a thing. It just won't.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Last time, you didn't actually win against this thing,  
did you? This time is no different. This is just how it  
would have gone were there no dirty assassination.   
  
**Makiri:**  
It's an organ which expands infinitely as long as you  
feed it. Truly a monster without weakness, and  
impossible to defeat!   
  
**Makiri:**  
With this power, I shall take this world as my own,  
and finally arrive at the Root...!   
  
**???:**  
Won't change a thing. No different.   
  
**???:**  
As long as the thing's observable, we're no short o'  
routes to take.   
  
**???:**  
It may be a bit forced, but we should start by comin'  
up with a mechanism for instantaneous output.   
  
**Kama:**  
That's...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Lainur!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Rider's Master!  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
But, not just him!? What's with them?   
  
**L：Lainur:**  
A'right, gather up, guys.   
  
**H：Rani-T:**  
Y E A H.   
  
**J：Rani-T=spot:**  
S P E E D S T E R S have arrived.   
  
**I：Rani-T=spot:**  
Though, we are N O T “guys”, we are G I R L S.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Did the Transfer AIs...?  
  
---  
  
**Lainur:**  
I'll tell ya, this Rider's Noble Phantasm...ah,  
I forget the name, but it's like, “take off the mask and  
show your face”.   
  
**Lainur:**  
It ups the abilities of anyone who sees it, so the  
Raniment the AI carry got all excited and amplified.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I just preserved that initially generated amplification,  
condensed it, and cheekily sent it off into this “future”.   
  
**Sion:**  
Hah!? Something like that is&mdash;   
  
**Lainur:**  
Totally possible. The attribute of the Codes I can cast  
is Imaginary Numbers...   
  
**Lainur:**  
So I asked myself, “Why aren't you makin' the  
Imaginary Number Space into a pocket that isn't a  
slave to time and space, ya chump?”   
  
**Lainur:**  
And sure, I can open it just fine, but to consolidate it  
into somethin' usable, I need these guys simply to form  
the receiver...   
  
**Lainur:**  
Eh, just think of it as a necessary expense.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I've already come up with the formula to put it into  
practice and stimulate them. Line 'em up, crew.   
  
**I：Rani-T:**  
R O G E R.   
  
**Lainur:**  
All good?   
  
**C：Rani-T:**  
Any time.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Rider...   
  
**Lainur:**  
If you so dearly wish to be a tool, then I'll use you as  
one.   
  
**Lainur:**  
You'll be a switch for this spell.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
As you wish.   
  
**Makiri:**  
What...are you playing at? Damned brat!   
  
**Lainur:**  
I mean...I made a cannon. Only possible to be used  
right here, right now.   
  
**Lainur:**  
&mdash;Connection: set. Request unlocking.  
Minute correction of occlusion coordinates.  
Connecting to the Imaginary World Layer.  
Turn, hook, turn, commence.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Pocket, open&mdash;!   
  
**Lainur:**  
Now, Rider!   
  
**Makiri:**  
What now?   
  
**Lainur:**  
What am I gonna name these fireworks? Ah, whatever.   
  
**Lainur:**  
It's just a single-use, pure artillery piece. The  
Starmine's rapid-fire is a bit too absurd for my tastes.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I'mma call it the “Raniment Fireworks”!!   
  
**Makiri:**  
This...power! Where&mdash;!?   
  
**Lainur:**  
I told ya, it's just a boring ol' transfer straight from the  
past. But don't worry about any of that, ya old geezer.   
  
**Lainur:**  
You should look to the future.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Because you're about to be blown to hell by a  
ridiculously simple-minded and huge output!   
  
**Lainur:**  
Yeah, that's some rock 'n' roll to knock yer socks off.  
What I'd give to always feel this refreshed&ndash;!   
  
### Arrow 5  
  
**Narration:**  
Everything fades.   
  
**Narration:**  
My foolish/beloved wives.  
The bugs which nest in my body.   
  
**Narration:**  
As I am now, I believe...   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;It's all for the better.   
  
**Narration:**  
In my last moments, I see that I am no more than a  
misshapen shred of something greater.   
  
**Narration:**  
I exist within myself, an utterly distorted figure of a  
being, which draws out the utterly distorted thing that  
is I.   
  
**Narration:**  
If not even the mercy of God is able to reach a being  
so diminutive and distorted, then it is divine providence  
that it should be shattered into a thousand pieces.   
  
**Narration:**  
I am relieved.  
I laugh with scorn.   
  
**Narration:**  
Ah, it seems I truly am detached now. I overlook all.  
It's all someone else's problem now.   
  
**Narration:**  
No longer am I that fairy tale made manifest.  
Nor am I the source the tale derived from.   
  
**Narration:**  
Now just scraps of consciousness; unable to  
comprehend.   
  
**Narration:**  
But, if there is one thing I do comprehend&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
It's that the one to close this door, should be me in my  
entirety.   
  
**Narration:**  
And so, by means of this pride remaining in the final  
moments of a being who may not even be myself,  
I extend my reach.   
  
**Narration:**  
How awfully unfortunate&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;that no holy virgin resides here.   
  
**Narration:**  
And so...   
  
**Narration:**  
This taboo room shall never, ever be opened again.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Not...like...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
We...did it...?  
  
**Lainur:**  
Hey, back it up a bit. I didn't save y'all.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Lainur...saved us...?  
  
**Lainur:**  
Huh? I didn't save y'all.   
  
---  
  
**Lainur:**  
That's just how it went down, see? That thing  
would've become a nuisance if left alone.   
  
**Sion:**  
It was a marvelous “gun”.   
  
**Sion:**  
Priming the stimulated Raniment drawn from the AIs  
by Rider's Noble Phantasm, and then on top of that,   
  
**Sion:**  
just as skillfully using the energy stored in Imaginary  
Number Space to simply launch it as a bullet...   
  
**Sion:**  
It would have been impossible for anyone to  
withstand without a high-level conceptual defense,  
or just a defense-type Noble Phantasm.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Heh, at least some of ya have a good set o' eyes.   
  
**Sion:**  
However, the large-scale spell used just now is linked  
to this place.   
  
**Sion:**  
As in, couldn't use it anywhere but “here”. Couldn't  
have changed either position or angle.   
  
**Sion:**  
Very much a pre-mounted, single-use piece of artillery.   
  
**Sion:**  
Though, being able to pinpoint a make-or-break  
formula requiring prior preparation  
to that extent&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
Could it be...a Code approaching precognition?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Not quite. I just measure the future and send it  
whatever seems necessary.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I guess that's the sort of being I am.   
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...   
  
**Lainur:**  
Oh, you're not an AI? No, I guess even in that case,  
it doesn't change much.   
  
**Lainur:**  
If you're familiar with Thought Partitioning,  
you should be able to grasp it a bit better.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Just because someone has the same face as another,  
doesn't mean they're the spittin' image on the inside.   
  
**Kama:**  
What are you on about?   
  
**Kama:**  
Anyway, this time it's really over...right?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Right? I'm fed up with this braindead repetition!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Like Saber's Master, I too would like to just drop to  
the floor for a quick nap,   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
but I can't rest easy until I know the guy's dealt with.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Sakura! Are you...  
&mdash;Ah!?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Wh-hat!?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ah&mdash;it's the General Supervisor again?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Greetings to all. I'm contacting you as part of my  
duties as overseer of the System Grail War.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
This is a mass-transmission to all participants.  
Note that this transmission is one-way. Please do not  
attempt to respond.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Main subject: The complete disappearance of Servant  
Caster's Spirit Core has just been confirmed.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...!  
  
---  
  
**Rani XII:**  
The performers of this task were the Rider party.  
Thus, Rider's Master, prime AI of the Transfer sector,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
will be delegated the authority of prime AI of the Build  
sector, possessed by Caster's Master.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Following this, the partitions will be consolidated.  
They will become joined, adjacent Transfer-Build  
sectors.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Preparations for converting the world in such a  
manner are already underway.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Please take note that any tremors are a result of this  
action, and not due to an earthquake.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Hmm... Sounds interesting. Man...   
  
**Kama:**  
World...conversion?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Indeed, that's definitely what she said, but...  
what does it mean?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Let's see, searching the rules... In the event of Servant  
death...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
This generous overseer will give you, a non-intellectual,  
a brief explanation.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
In simple terms&mdash;are you familiar with the  
concept of a gyrocompass?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It determines its heading based on gyration.  
Please refer to the database for a detailed  
explanation.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
To be concise, this is a similar mechanism, based on  
sympathetic magecraft.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
With the continuation of the System Grail War,  
this internal world rotates, redefining the foundational  
axis of the Imaginary Number Compass called  
PAPERMOON.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That is the mechanism provided by this Holy Grail  
War.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Naturally, it is a concept limited to this internal world,  
and will not affect the physical properties of the  
macro world.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
But no matter the case, this world continues to rotate.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
We apologize for any inconvenience, and ask that you  
bear with us a while longer.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Please prepare for the inevitable generation of  
momentary rotation.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Though equipment has been secured, no compensatio-  
n will be handed out in the event of loss or damages.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
And so, everyone, following this reset of positions,  
may you once more strive forward in the System Grail  
War.   
  
**Sion:**  
World conversion...partition consolidation...  
momentary rotation...   
  
**Sion:**  
Wait, this is bad&mdash;!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Heyheyhey! Everything's shaking all violently!   
  
**Kama:**  
Master! Hold onto me tight!   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;  
&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
Phase one: Confirming conclusion. AEC Method  
progressing favourably.   
  
**Narration:**  
Verifying tentative Svedberg numbers...threshold not  
met. Within expectations; proceed as planned.   
  
**Narration:**  
Raised by #3&mdash;  
Denied by #2.   
  
**Narration:**  
Some numbers are irregular, yet no deviations  
apparent. Recommended to proceed as planned.   
  
**Narration:**  
Separate proposition raised by #1.   
  
**Narration:**  
Among the irregularities exists an Import-type—that is,  
one Master's AI type is Alterego Imported&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
At present, they possess the most potential to  
become a hindrance to the programme.   
  
**Narration:**  
All designations in agreement.   
  
**Narration:**  
Assign them highest priority and observe.   
  
**Narration:**  
In the event of them becoming impure&ndash;  
authorization for elimination will be granted.   
  
**Narration:**  
However...even under such circumstances, attempts to  
respond with immediate correctional actions will be  
attempted continuously.   
  
**Narration:**  
Agreed. Agreed. Agreed.   
  
**Narration:**  
This programme, this experiment, this production—all  
of it, for the sake of saving the world from ruin.   
  
**Narration:**  
Ceasing activities midway will not be considered.  
For the sake of the world, it cannot be allowed.   
  
**Narration:**  
Thus,   
  
**Narration:**  
the Bird of the Netherworld will wish for the moon  
not to rise to the southern sky.   
  
## Section 9: The Sin of Rotation/"future"  
  
### Arrow 1  
  
**???:**  
Do you know the answer?  
“Who are you?”   
  
**Narration:**  
It was recently. I feel like someone asked me that  
question.   
  
**Kama:**  
No, I don't understand, but like, there's no point in  
knowing.   
  
**Kama:**  
I am me. The one with the bodies that satisfy all  
desires. The god of love and demon king of lapse.   
  
**Kama:**  
I am me; a singular being.  
Yet at this point I might already be two,   
  
**Kama:**  
and perhaps there are innumerable “I”s which each  
exist for their own interests.   
  
**Kama:**  
“Who are you?” What a stupid question. It's  
meaningless.   
  
**T：???:**  
No, that's not what I mean. I just wanted to give you a  
warning before&mdash;   
  
**Kama:**  
Can you just shut it? You're only a memory.   
  
**Kama:**  
Indeed, I witnessed this memory which I just so  
happened to recall from somewhere else.   
  
**Kama:**  
Did it got shaken loose by some shock and just pop  
out?   
  
**Kama:**  
Regardless, it can't have been that important if I  
forgot about it until now.   
  
**Kama:**  
Not to mention, right now...   
  
**Kama:**  
Don't get in my way. I can't let this chance slip me.   
  
**T：???:**  
Hey, hold up a minute. Can't you see this is important!?   
  
**T：???:**  
I'm trying to tell you, the reason you're here is&mdash;   
  
**Kama:**  
Yeah yeah, so long. If I have some more spare time,  
I'm sure I unfortunately won't fail to remember you  
again.   
  
**Narration:**  
Yes... If it's a matter of importance, then right now,  
this moment, is what's really important.   
  
**Narration:**  
Ah, this warmth. This sensation.   
  
**Narration:**  
What I&mdash;wish for&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(So white...)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(Everything around me is soft and fluffy...)  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Hehe, it's like heaven, don't you think?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
So am I, uh, dead...?  
  
**Kama:**  
In the tragic case of your death, the only one left you  
could rely on is me, a god, right?   
  
**Kama:**  
The fact that only the two of us are here now, alone,  
is proof enough of that.   
  
**Kama:**  
I'm the only one you can rely on, so it's okay to  
depend on me some more.   
  
**Kama:**  
Please grow dependant on me, actually. Turn over all  
your most precious emotions to me.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I'm not dead, right...?  
  
**Kama:**  
Well, what do you think?   
  
**Kama:**  
If that's the case, I being the only one here when you  
woke up proves that I was the one who protected you.   
  
**Kama:**  
In that case, shouldn't I be rewarded for that?   
  
**Kama:**  
Come... Hold me longer. Pour your heart into it.  
Hug me tight, pat me on the head...   
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Yes, then... Would it be right for me to consider  
your&mdash;mine?   
  
**Kama:**  
Would it...? Say it would...   
  
**T：???:**  
CUT... Take this plotline off the script!   
  
**Sion:**  
Ahem...  
If you would come out quickly, please.   
  
**Sion:**  
Being stuck inside such a confined space for so long  
must be suffocating. Luckily, I was able to rescue you  
promptly.   
  
**Kama:**  
Tch...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Where was I...?  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
When I came to, I was already in there as well,  
so I wasn't really sure what was going on either...   
  
**Kama:**  
Hm, it seems at least that the inside was covered with  
what seems to be some light and fluffy cotton.   
  
**Kama:**  
So the two of us were in this cylindrical bed which  
was like a padded room?   
  
**Sion:**  
That's right. If you move back a bit, you can see I was  
in the space adjacent to yours.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
There are...so many of them...  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
It could be that this place is the “outer perimeter” of  
the world that is the PAPERMOON.   
  
**Sion:**  
I don't know if it's some special precaution because of  
the Holy Grail War, or if it's standard procedure,   
  
**Sion:**  
but it seems that the entirety of the outer wall is made  
up of these shock-absorbent components.   
  
**Sion:**  
(Is there any meaning to their shape? It's almost like  
a pillar, or a...Coffin...?)   
  
**Sion:**  
Judging from the message we received from Rani XII,   
  
**Sion:**  
it seems one of the mechanisms of the Holy Grail War  
was for the world to rotate at some stage, thus altering  
the partition structure.   
  
**Sion:**  
That's probably why we were thrown all the way to  
the outer perimeter...I guess.   
  
**Kama:**  
I'm not following at all. Some stage? Is this because of  
Caster's death?   
  
**Sion:**  
I believe so. The System Grail War incorporates an  
element of the prime AIs competing for territory.   
  
**Sion:**  
If you manage to defeat another Servant and claim  
victory, you will receive their authority, allowing you to  
administrate multiple partitions...   
  
**Sion:**  
In other words, you would have multiple domains.   
  
**Sion:**  
This may even be the primary reason why the newly  
controlled region was even physically moved and  
“merged”.   
  
**Kama:**  
Hmm, moving even the actual places of the world  
seems a bit overblown, doesn't it?   
  
**Kama:**  
Well, when it comes to the domain of gods; mountains,  
oceans, and the like do tend to be thrown around  
pretty nonchalantly.   
  
**Sion:**  
Let's run the basic localization program we copied  
from Ayus.   
  
**Sion:**  
I see. The locations outside of the actual center have  
definitely changed.   
  
**Sion:**  
It appears that the whole world has rotated,  
causing the positional relationships of the partitions to  
become misaligned.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
So it didn't just rotate.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I thought their physical positions couldn't change...?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
A valid question, but remember that this is a virtual  
world.   
  
**Sion:**  
For example, just then, the thickness of each partition  
may have been made conceptually close to zero.   
  
**Sion:**  
At the end of the day, we just have to accept that  
“them's the rules”.   
  
**Sion:**  
The same goes for any Raniment and all the AI in the  
various managerial areas of the world.   
  
**Sion:**  
The PAPERMOON was most definitely a compass  
equipped with a rotating mechanism.   
  
**Sion:**  
The fact that momentary rotation in the form of a  
gyrocompass is needed for regulation...   
  
**Sion:**  
Well, it's something that does make sense in this  
world, but really makes you scratch your head in  
relation to the macro world.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I...see..?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Now, the merging of two partitions carries two  
implications:   
  
**Sion:**  
First is that the winner, the Rider faction, has simply  
doubled the available area in which they can easily  
procure Raniment.   
  
**Sion:**  
This is an inevitability since the leadership roles of the  
AI have changed as well.   
  
**Sion:**  
The other implication is that no one can have outposts.   
  
**Kama:**  
What does that mean?   
  
**Sion:**  
Let me explain it the other way around.   
  
**B：Sion:**  
Had the Build sector been left to remain unmerged,  
it would have been able to serve as an outpost for the  
Rider party.   
  
**B：Sion:**  
If they had chosen to instead just make that their  
home base, then the Transfer section would have  
served as an outpost.   
  
**B：Sion:**  
In other words, it creates a situation where only one  
of the two can be safeguarded, while the other one has  
to be left on its own.   
  
**B：Sion:**  
The winner's prize cannot be a new set of  
disadvantages.   
  
**B：Sion:**  
The rules say to merge the partitions themselves in  
order to avoid this scenario.   
  
**B：Sion:**  
Doubling the available area will likewise increase the  
work to protect it, but compared to the benefits,  
this is nothing worth complaining about.   
  
**B：Sion:**  
More importantly, in the scenario that only two  
surviving parties remain,   
  
**B：Sion:**  
it avoids a situation where both of them are on  
opposite sides of the map, unable to affect each other.   
  
**B：Sion:**  
This way, it's like they're forcing a scenario where  
everyone's close to each other at all times.   
  
**B：Sion:**  
You could even say it's a necessary development to  
actually promote continued battle in the Holy Grail War.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I hope the AIs are all okay.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
To the extent of my knowledge, the regular AI not  
involved with the war should have remained unaffected  
by the centrifugal momentum just now.   
  
**Sion:**  
On the other hand, that means Ayus and Duryodhana  
would have also been thrown elsewhere.   
  
**Sion:**  
Same for Rider and Saber's party.   
  
**Sion:**  
I'm unable to spot either of them, so I would have to  
assume a certain randomness in the distribution.   
  
**Sion:**  
Though, as expected, they cannot seem to force a  
separation between Master and Servant...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Guess we should meet up with Ayus first.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
I agree, that would be for the best.   
  
**Sion:**  
I consensually planted a tracer on her, like a  
transmission-esque Code.   
  
**Sion:**  
I thought it would help with finding her later.   
  
**Sion:**  
Though, since we'll be moving along the outer  
perimeter, chances are we'll run into someone else.   
  
**Sion:**  
We'll need to stay on guard.   
  
**Kama:**  
You know, the Rider party may have been real coy  
about actually wanting to help...   
  
**Kama:**  
But no way would I have expected them to sit on an  
attack with such a stupid amount of firepower.   
  
**Kama:**  
So don't get caught off guard again, Master.  
For all we know, something like that could be aimed  
at us next time.   
  
**Kama:**  
Well... Whatever happens, Master, I'll be there to save  
you, alright?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Thank you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Thanks for trying to help earlier.  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
That upfront sort of gratitude is much appreciated.  
You know I'm always accepting compliments, right?   
  
**Kama:**  
Even now would be a good time for more, don't you  
think? Maybe even...some physical touch...?   
  
**Sion:**  
That was a ton of preparation for a single-use Greater  
Spell. I doubt they could set it up again so easily...   
  
**Sion:**  
But I agree we should stay on guard. Rider's Master...  
that enigmatic guy, is long gone now.   
  
**Sion:**  
(That said, it really felt like there was something that  
only he was seeing. What could it have been...?)   
  
**Sion:**  
(He gave off a vibe like his highest priority was to  
search for the answers to something, rather than fight  
in the war.)   
  
**Sion:**  
(Regardless, we should keep our eyes peeled.)   
  
**Sion:**  
(Whatever the answer he seeks,)   
  
**Sion:**  
(we can't know if it will benefit or harm us&mdash;)   
  
### Arrow 2  
  
**Narration:**  
Who am I?   
  
**Narration:**  
I can at least tell you my name: Lainur Gusion.   
  
**Narration:**  
If it's a title you want, there are plenty.   
  
**Narration:**  
System Grail War participant.  
Master of Rider. Prime AI of the Transfer sector...   
  
**Narration:**  
Ah, my bad, my bad. That's not important right now.   
  
**Narration:**  
I got some sort of tremendous directive, something  
unrelated to the duties and ideas programmed into my  
AI.   
  
**Narration:**  
I would go so far as to say most of my being is  
dominated by it.   
  
**Narration:**  
It thrusts my body into action from the depths of my  
being. It's a fever running rampant through my whole  
body as this imitation of a heart beats.   
  
**Narration:**  
If it conflicts with my original mission as an AI,  
it might be fundamentally lost or I'll become  
indecisive over it,   
  
**Narration:**  
but as it stands right now, the impetus to push  
forward prevails.   
  
**Narration:**  
It is, in simple terms, a wish. Or perhaps a craving.   
  
**Narration:**  
Perhaps I have an innate familiarity for systematically  
isolating parts of my existence? Whether that's out of  
preference or not, I don't know.   
  
**Narration:**  
But that's likely the reason why I have such an  
overhead view of myself.   
  
**Narration:**  
A purely functional entity originally designed to have  
one major directive.   
  
**Narration:**  
Because I am self-conscious about my own existence  
as such a being, I'm able to consciously apply this  
craving to myself...   
  
**Narration:**  
Something like that, at least...   
  
**Narration:**  
So what is this craving, this wish?   
  
**Narration:**  
It's most definitely the word which best describes me.   
  
**Narration:**  
“Future”.   
  
**Narration:**  
Then, the answer would have to be...   
  
**Narration:**  
I am an “&mdash;”, that which has been separated from  
something, driven by the directive called the future...   
  
**Lainur:**  
Hey hey hey, c'mon. What the hell's going on here...?   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
...  
...   
  
**Lainur:**  
Haha, I appreciate you not questionin' me about it  
back there, Rider. After all, I don't wanna have to  
explain this just yet!   
  
**Lainur:**  
I'll only do so when I have definitive proof, but when I  
do, I'll tell you about it 'til you get sick of hearing about  
it...   
  
**Lainur:**  
Well, would you even be interested in listenin' or tune  
out completely? Ah, who cares!   
  
**Lainur:**  
Let's get a move on! On to the next point!   
  
**Lainur:**  
Haha...hahahaha! I knew it!  
Everything's misaligned to hell!   
  
**Lainur:**  
But, what's this actually mean?   
  
**Lainur:**  
In the first place, the fact that the world is circular in  
shape means&mdash;   
  
**Lainur:**  
That's what the movement was for...?   
  
**Lainur:**  
No, the key is the “future”. What'll happen to the future  
if this continues?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Indeed, that's what's needed. This power...  
centrifugal force...   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Master, may I ask a question?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Hehe, sure, ask away! What great timing!  
I've got it, I really think I've got it now!   
  
**Lainur:**  
Just what'll be brought about by this Holy Grail War!   
  
**Lainur:**  
No, perhaps it's the case that this whole thing began  
because of&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
Impurity classified.  
Executing removal.   
  
**B：Lainur:**  
...Eh?   
  
**E：Gao Changgong:**  
Master!   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
(&mdash;What negligence! I felt no presence at all.  
I wouldn't have expected a sharpshooter from such an  
extreme distance...!)   
  
**Lainur:**  
Hah...guh...   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Master!   
  
**Lainur:**  
Ri...der. The enemy...is&mdash;   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Signs of pursuit are...inexistent. Perhaps their aim was  
simply to assassinate you...   
  
**Lainur:**  
So I've done my assigned task and have no more use,  
huh?   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
...  
...   
  
**Lainur:**  
Shit, they got me good. It appears I've uncovered  
something they didn't want uncovered.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I thought I would finally be able to observe the next  
“future”, but...   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Master, I apologize. I've&mdash;   
  
**Lainur:**  
It's fine, it's fine. I'm sorry I didn't let you have a  
proper fight.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Knowin' the warrior you are, you must've piled up a lot  
of frustration.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I woulda liked to have you work for the sake of the  
future...   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
No... You understood me when I was like this.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Perhaps I exist here in some warped state.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
But you...you treated me just as myself. You didn't  
view me as a hero, nor did you look down upon me.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
You did not fear me to be something more than I am.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
And for the me here right now&mdash;that was  
sufficient, and I am most grateful for it.   
  
**Lainur:**  
&mdash;Hah, you were worried about that stuff?   
  
**Lainur:**  
The only one who would be scared of a kind soul like  
you is someone unfit to be your lord...   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
...  
...   
  
**Lainur:**  
No, I wasn't fit to be either. I only wanted to see what  
came next.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I was willing to sacrifice any amount of the past and  
present for that sake...   
  
**Lainur:**  
I'm a shit Master, too. So, at my last moments...  
I'll go out kicking.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Rider. You know what to do&mdash;   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Is this really all right?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Yeah, it might be a waste, who knows. But if there's a  
chance it'll make a difference&mdash;I'll do it.   
  
**Lainur:**  
That's...how I am.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Mm... Alright. Almost done.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Even if I don't, you could still have a future.   
  
**Lainur:**  
If my Master rights are left alone, perhaps a new  
Master will be born again...   
  
**Lainur:**  
If there's another Master who's well-off enough to  
support two Servants...serving them wouldn't be so bad...   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Farewell, Master.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
As for your final words, I have no desire to serve two  
Masters.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
I shall simply wait here until I depart,   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
reflecting on the godsent fact that you alone treated  
me as a tool.   
  
**???:**  
Oh? You want to be treated as a tool? You're the  
godsend here.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
What!? You're...Caster's...!   
  
**Makiri:**  
You failed to notice the last vestige of me, a single tiny  
insect, concealed in the shadows!   
  
**Makiri:**  
Like a tiny thing which could have been crushed so  
easily, hahaha, but luck was on my side!   
  
**Makiri:**  
I'm surprised to see he died with his Command Spell  
left behind!   
  
**Makiri:**  
They don't just provide Master rights. They are such  
an unimaginable wealth of power!   
  
**Makiri:**  
And so, by my Command Spell, I order you!   
  
**Makiri:**  
Rider, receive my bugs and submit as a new Servant to  
me, Makiri Zolgen!   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Guh...gaaaaaaah!   
  
**Makiri:**  
I don't know which Servant was his assassin...   
  
**Makiri:**  
But to not send out their retrieval dogs to immediately  
snatch up their prey... How foolish. How utterly foolish.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Geh heh... Heh heh heh heh...!   
  
## Section 10: Petal Misfortune/red lotus flower  
  
### Arrow 1 Pre-Battle  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Are you sure Ayus is this way?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
According to the tracer, yes.   
  
**Sion:**  
It seems they moved from the position they initially  
landed on and came this way.   
  
**Kama:**  
Why are they not just sitting tight? What a chore.   
  
**Kama:**  
Wait, isn't that them?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ah! Thank goodness, you're all right!   
  
**Sion:**  
Likewise. However, how come you're all the way out  
here?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Sorry. I didn't intend to move far from where we  
landed, but Berserker...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I'm starved! And I could smell something good,  
so obviously I had to go chase that scent! (Munching)   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Actually, there are lots of "food stalls" here.  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Yeah, back in the day, it was all “I sell square things”,  
“I sell round things”, “I'll sell you more things”,  
and the like.   
  
**Ayus:**  
The stores only differed slightly like that.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Maybe it's because the trend of cooking has grown so  
much now, but they've really changed.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Materials are processed in ways I never thought were  
possible!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Oh, what's that, Berserker?  
It looks so good, let me have a taste!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Mmph, you want some?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Okay. (Gulp)   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ah!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
C'mon, don't be so petty over food. Hey hey,  
stop slamming me, will ya!?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Who's the petty one!?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Just go buy your own, no one's stopping you.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Do we pay in Raniment?  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Ah, yes. You do.   
  
**Kama:**  
Aren't you just losing Raniment by paying for a dish  
that contains less Raniment?   
  
**Ayus:**  
If all you care about is Raniment, perhaps so.  
But in our case, the principal effect is to maintain our  
structure as AI.   
  
**Ayus:**  
For someone like Berserker, it doesn't make much  
sense to pay for food with Raniment.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Like I care! I can eat whatever I want!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Anyway... What is this place?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Right, I was going to tell you until you ran off to get  
food.   
  
**Ayus:**  
These are the outskirts of the Keep sector.  
Do you notice how all the shops are run by K-types?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
What... If this is the Keep sector, then this is Lancer's  
place!?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Why didn't you say so sooner!?   
  
**Sion:**  
For now, Lancer is nowhere in sight.   
  
**Sion:**  
Which means, if we have no further business here,  
it would most likely be prudent to move on from here  
before we draw unneeded ire.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Indeed, we should decide what to do next.   
  
**Kama:**  
That's fine by me, but can I ask something?   
  
**Kama:**  
Don't you think the ratio of AI types here is a bit off?   
  
**Kama:**  
Maybe that's just the state of things here, but we have  
tons of K-types as well as T-types all over.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hm? Ah, now that you mention it.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I don't think there's a reason for T-types to be more  
susceptible to structural degradation, so...how come?   
  
**J：???:**  
Yes, how come, indeed?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Caster's&mdash;  
  
---  
  
**Makiri:**  
Not anymore.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Guh...kah...!   
  
**Kama:**  
Rider...   
  
**Sion:**  
I would have never expected him to survive that  
cannon blast, never mind to also to subjugate a new  
Servant.   
  
**Sion:**  
I would definitely be interested in hearing all the  
details of that, but I'm sure that opportunity will never  
come.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Quite right. I am neither here to talk nor to eat.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Geh heh heh, the infinite monstrosity that was Caster  
may be no more, but my power is a perfect match for  
this Rider.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Come now, Rider. You have the support of my bugs.  
You must be overflowing with power, aren't you?   
  
**Makiri:**  
More specifically, I tinkered with your Saint Graph in  
order to make it operate more efficiently than ever on  
less Raniment.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Guh...!   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Run...away... I'm...no longer...! No...this...man...!   
  
**Makiri:**  
No time for chit-chat. Chirp, my bugs.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
No way would we run.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
This geezer may not know when to quit, but no shot is  
he stronger than that huge monstrosity.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Let's settle this once and for all! I got my misgivings  
about the locale, so let's finish the fight quickly!   
  
**Kama:**  
Compared to running away now, this would certainly  
save us a lot of time later, huh?   
  
**Kama:**  
I feel some primal drive to crush these disgusting bugs!   
  
[Battle]  
  
### Arrow 2 Pre-Battle  
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
(Panting)   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
He's just...strong!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
It would appear the Rider before us now has  
undergone an absurd boost in strength.   
  
**Sion:**  
His basic parameters are on the level of straight up  
cheating.   
  
**Sion:**  
His physical strength, endurance, reaction speed...  
None of them are at the level of an average Servant  
anymore.   
  
**Sion:**  
Like he said, this must be because of tinkering with  
the inside with those weird bug Codes.   
  
**Sion:**  
I could probably imitate the effect by plucking at the  
cranial nerves with my Etherlight...   
  
**Sion:**  
But in that case, the burden would be distributed  
equally throughout the whole body, and it wouldn't be  
able to last long.   
  
**Sion:**  
I don't know if something similar is going on here,  
but it definitely appears to be quite painful for him.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Geh heh heh, pain is not a parameter that needs  
consideration.   
  
**Makiri:**  
So long as the body moves, it's fine. And since the  
bugs are the ones controlling the movement,  
pain will not become a hindrance.   
  
**Kama:**  
Wow, nice rational love, eh? You're the worst.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Still, perseverance dwindles.   
  
**Makiri:**  
If it were just one Servant, it might have been possible,  
but two at the same time, well...   
  
**Makiri:**  
We'll just have to take our time and see, won't we?   
  
**Bhima:**  
I came to see what all the noise is about. What are you  
guys doing in my backyard?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Bhima...!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(I thought it'd be her, but...it wasn't?)   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(No, it's not like I wanted to see her again...  
Nor did I have anything in mind to do if I did.)   
  
**Bhima:**  
I was in the middle of trying out a new recipe,  
so if we could wrap this up quickly&mdash;   
  
**Bhima:**  
It seems this time it's not His Royal Dumbass making  
a mess.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Wh-Who are you calling a royal dumbass!?  
I've never made a mess in my life!   
  
**Bhima:**  
Love that look on your face, buddy.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Though now's not the time for that.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Hey, geezer... Are you here to kill me, you creepy old  
fart?   
  
**Makiri:**  
Heheh, heh heh heh. Just as I foresaw. This domain is  
your area.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Lancer. I vividly remember you crushing me.  
Well, not this me, but regardless.   
  
**Makiri:**  
No fair fight, no chivalry, just sneaking up from  
behind&mdash;like an insect!   
  
**Makiri:**  
I have not forgotten that disgrace, and so, I will punish  
you distinctly.   
  
**Makiri:**  
And you'll die, along with the rest of these people.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Hah, you think you're up to it?   
  
**Makiri:**  
He is.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Rider...   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Wa...it...   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Guh...!   
  
**Bhima:**  
Hold up. You look like you've eaten something really  
nasty. Are you really gonna fight like that?   
  
**Makiri:**  
Don't fret. There is more than one way to fight.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Heh heh heh. Following the trend of the Master  
before me, I made something just for you&ndash;a weapon.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Rider, remove your mask.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Ugh... Stop...!   
  
**Sion:**  
(His Noble Phantasm!? But, using it here...why...  
No&mdash;it can't be!)   
  
**Makiri:**  
The connection was already made. All I had to do was  
reconfigure it.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Say&mdash;didn't you think there were a suspicious  
number of Transfer-type AIs here?   
  
**Sion:**  
Kama, protect Fujimaru! I'll bring [♂ him /♀️ her] to  
the ground with the Etherlight!   
  
**Kama:**  
Huh? I'm not really following, but...got it!   
  
**Makiri:**  
Do not resist. Remove your mask, Rider.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Stop...it...!   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
(Stop. This is wrong. This is&mdash;evil.)   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
(I...thought I could be evil, but I can't.)   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
(I thought I would rather be a mere foolish,  
evil blade than to be betrayed and shunned by my  
lord.)   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
(But to be truly evil...I could never want that!)   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
(So...so&mdash;)   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
O...Master. I beg you.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Stop this, please. I will not allow you...to do this...   
  
**Makiri:**  
How amusing. Tell me, how is this different from the  
actions of your previous Master?   
  
**Makiri:**  
It is simply a culmination of the principles which my  
younger self held.   
  
**Makiri:**  
An AI under someone's control is a mere tool.   
  
**Makiri:**  
I am simply using them as they are intended—as the  
disposable tools they are.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Now, remove your mask.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Their Raniment stimulated by your Noble Phantasm,   
  
**Makiri:**  
will react with the custom-made insects I implanted in  
them&mdash;!   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
&mdash;   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
S...top...   
  
**K：Rani-T:**  
Ah...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(The blossoms on their clothes.)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(The T-type girls, they...)  
  
---  
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Stooooooop!!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Ugh...  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Master!?   
  
**Kama:**  
Limbs still attached, not bleeding profusely,  
apparently still able to see... Thank goodness.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
How awful...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
This!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
I can't believe it. What an awful thing to do...!   
  
**Kama:**  
What is even happening?   
  
**Sion:**  
I conjecture that by using the mechanism whereby the  
T-types' Raniment is stimulated by Rider's Noble  
Phantasm,   
  
**Sion:**  
they seem to have activated every single one of the  
Codes inserted into the bodies of the AIs  
simultaneously.   
  
**Sion:**  
In other words...directly converting the Raniment into  
a destructive force.   
  
**Sion:**  
The implication being: A self-destruct function.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Very good. It's just as strong as I expected, no,  
even stronger.   
  
**Makiri:**  
It is also to my benefit that these things are mobile as  
part of their inherent nature as AI. This will work no  
matter what hole anyone hides in.   
  
**Makiri:**  
I shall call it the Transfer Bomb...   
  
**Rani-K:**  
Uh....ah...?   
  
**Rani-R:**  
Critical...damage...shutdown, initi&mdash;   
  
**Rani-D=spot:**  
Destruction. Workload increased. Impossible to deal  
with...   
  
**Makiri:**  
And any nutrition spilled as a result is simply collected  
again by my bugs. Quite remarkable, isn't it?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
This is just...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Unforgivable...!  
  
---  
  
**Makiri:**  
Oh? You're saying you won't forgive me, Master of  
Assassin?   
  
**Sion:**  
Hold on, give me a minute.   
  
**Sion:**  
We need to assess the status of Ayus' party,  
as well as Lancer's...!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Guh...huuh... Hey...Master. Are you...okay...?   
  
**Ayus:**  
A....h... Huh...?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Couldn't cover you sufficiently, huh? You might have  
a concussion...)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(I'm not in any condition to get up on my feet right  
now, either&mdash;)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(And...that guy...)   
  
**Bhima:**  
Shit... He's got the same stench on him as that brat  
from before, but he's devolved into a real animal.   
  
**Bhima:**  
He's completely discarded whatever human  
kindness—whatever conscience—remained in the depths  
of his being.   
  
**Bhima:**  
&mdash;Are you all right, Master? Well, I protected you,  
so it should be a given.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Y-Yeah.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
But you know, when you hold me that tightly,  
it's not exactly painless. Your armor is kinda  
suffocating. It really hurts.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Bear with me. We were the closest to the blast.  
I had no other way of protecting you than deploying  
this armor.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Anywaay. Now what?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
What can we do?   
  
**Bhima:**  
We're still that guy's priority target, but I can't protect  
you without using this style.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I wouldn't want some AI sneaking up behind you and  
blowing you to pieces while I'm beating the shit out of  
that old fart.   
  
**Bhima:**  
If you can put up with the oppressive heat, I can break  
away with you in my arms&mdash;   
  
**Bhima:**  
But I think it's best we wait and see.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Y-Yeah, well...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hey, hold up for a minute, Bhima!   
  
**Bhima:**  
What now...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I hate giving you any breath, but I have to say this here  
and now!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
What's wrong with you!? Why don't you fight!?  
Are you some kind of coward, Bhima? Are you a  
coward!?   
  
**Bhima:**  
The mouth on you...   
  
**Bhima:**  
No, this is just your usual way of stirring the pot,  
all while leaving what actually matters for others to  
take care of, isn't it?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Just the way it went with Karna and the rest.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Shut it, this isn't about me right now. It's about you!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You flaunt your own strength, jumping on any enemy  
you spot and tearing them apart with your bare hands,  
like some superhuman dumbass.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You're just some war-crazed idiot who's too  
preoccupied with everyone knowing about your  
victories.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
So why don't you fight!? You were definitely not the  
kind of guy who would run away just for the sake of  
protecting a woman!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You, you... Just who are you!?  
Are you really the Bhima I knew!?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Lancer...   
  
**Bhima:**  
...  
...   
  
**Y：Bhima:**  
I never meant to come off as a war-crazed idiot,  
but I guess that's how it seemed to you guys anyway.   
  
**Y：Bhima:**  
I'm sorry I wasn't all you wanted me to be.  
I'm still not.   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;Who are you?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Right now, I am...   
  
**Bhima:**  
Someone who wants to serve his frail and  
weak-minded Master.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Wh-What the...?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Hah, you never got to know, did you?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Back when we were disguising ourselves to hide away  
in King Virata's palace,   
  
**Bhima:**  
I worked under the name of the head chef, Ballava,  
and what surprised me most was&mdash;I liked it.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I got really happy when someone enjoyed my cooking.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I started thinking that maybe spending life like this,  
only for the sake of serving others, might not be so  
bad.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Right now, that's what I'm remembering... That's  
what I'm becoming.   
  
**Bhima:**  
That's why anything else is secondary now.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You... You...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Are you sure you're really Bhima...?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Where is the warrior who fought—no, who did  
everything in his power to defeat me...? Where&mdash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Wait&ndash;guh!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Duryodhana, you're hurt.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Ayus' party can't go on...!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
&mdash;It seems so. I guess it's our turn to get out on  
the field.   
  
**Kama:**  
Sure, I was expecting to do all the work alone either  
way. It's no problem.   
  
**Kama:**  
And then I'll get rewarded generously... Got it?   
  
**Makiri:**  
So Assassin comes crawling back to the frontlines.  
Rider!   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Guh...ha...   
  
**Makiri:**  
Hm, your speech is muddied beyond comprehension.  
Did you bite off your tongue, perhaps?   
  
**Makiri:**  
Geh heh, geh heh heh heh! How splendid! To think  
that you were so ashamed!   
  
**Makiri:**  
I only reduced you to a tool, precisely as you wished.   
  
**Makiri:**  
That's right, languish to your heart's content.  
Heroes are no different from us when you peel away  
the veneer.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Biting off your tongue or not won't make a difference,  
my bugs will move your body regardless.   
  
**Makiri:**  
As long as you continue functioning, you can do  
whatever the hell you please!   
  
**Kama:**  
Man, this is just awful...   
  
**Kama:**  
Rider, dear. You are simply too pitiful, and that's why  
I'll love you.   
  
**Kama:**  
That agony. That pride. That grief. That&mdash;  
admirable pretense of evil being abused.   
  
**Kama:**  
Endure it no longer.   
  
**Kama:**  
I shall grant you the eternal tranquility of lapse.   
  
**Kama:**  
Amidst my love which drowns out all; I implore you,  
sink peacefully into eternal sleep&mdash;   
  
[Battle]  
  
### Arrow 3  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Phew... I'm starting to get my breathing under control  
again...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ber...serker...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hey, you're up. In that case&mdash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Assassin's party is taking care of the enemy,  
so we could take this chance to escape...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Berserker. You have to join them.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hey...   
  
**Ayus:**  
I...won't ever, absolutely ever, forgive him either.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Everyone were just hanging in there, no different than  
usual.   
  
**Ayus:**  
They were children, completely normal children,  
who might one day have had families.   
  
**Ayus:**  
But now...now that won't...   
  
**Ayus:**  
That's why...I beg you, Berserker.   
  
**Ayus:**  
That guy...you can't let him get away with this.  
If we don't take him out here, the same thing will  
definitely happen again.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...  
...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Sorry, I'm a bit dizzy...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Oh, I just don't want to see my family die.   
  
**Ayus:**  
But if I can't even stand to see my family die, then...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hey, Master...?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You passed out again... It's because you transferred  
too much Raniment to me all at once?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That last bit felt kinda strange, but...no, never mind  
that. Here's the issue.   
  
**Narration:**  
I ponder it.   
  
**Narration:**  
Bhima ran away. In that case, it wouldn't be remiss of  
me to do the same.   
  
**Narration:**  
It would be the most natural and obvious thing to do;  
the most appropriate.   
  
**Narration:**  
But&mdash;there is still another way to take this.   
  
**Narration:**  
I think about what that old geezer has done.   
  
**Narration:**  
I do understand it. The most efficient means of  
winning in war is to exploit weaknesses.   
  
**Narration:**  
The weak on the enemy side.  
The weak on your own side.   
  
**Narration:**  
When I think of it like that, the old fart isn't in the  
wrong.   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;But it makes me sick to my stomach.   
  
**Narration:**  
There are different kinds of wisdom, and I cannot  
stand the kind that's more wise and efficient than my  
own.   
  
**Narration:**  
There are kinds which, even if the wisest of us would  
come up with, we wouldn't do because it wouldn't be  
the smart move.   
  
**Narration:**  
And if someone then goes and flaunts that,  
then it's nothing more than irreverence towards the  
prince.   
  
**Narration:**  
Then there's definitely good reason to punish that  
person for it.   
  
**Narration:**  
Also, another thing...   
  
**Narration:**  
It's pretty simple, I think.   
  
**Narration:**  
If I bring down the hammer on those who have done  
vicious deeds here and now,   
  
**Narration:**  
then all those watching will feel relieved, wanting to  
praise and admire me for it.   
  
**Narration:**  
I'd simply be a hero. Rising above the masses,  
the most popular person around.   
  
**Narration:**  
That would be neat. I quite like being noticed; being  
praised.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Yeah, there's all sorts'a things I want. I want them.  
I need them.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
So&mdash;I have no other choice. I just have to do it.   
  
**Narration:**  
Besides, there was already the eyes of one person  
putting their trust to such a hero.   
  
**Narration:**  
But instead of letting one slip into zero, in a fit of  
greed, I thought it would be more appropriate for me to  
let one become a hundred.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Doryaa!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hey, what's up with you!?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You're standing here all helpless without me,  
forcing me to join the fight!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Your arrows have been flyin' all over the place without  
hittin' anything for ages now!   
  
**Kama:**  
Oh, is that what it looked like?   
  
**Kama:**  
Never mind, that's fine.   
  
**Kama:**  
I was making preparations, so I was trying to focus,  
but I'd really like for someone to pin down Rider for  
just a moment.   
  
**Kama:**  
So, would you kindly?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Huh? Now you're just leaving all the dirty work to  
me&mdash;Woah!   
  
**Kama:**  
How about you, Master?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I think we're prepared enough,  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
to pull this plan off.

**Kama:**  
I knew you'd catch on, it's like we're already one and  
the same, hehe.   
  
**Kama:**  
Now, I just need to focus for a bit...and I need some  
more resources from you, and...that's it.   
  
**Makiri:**  
(Berserker has returned? Regardless, Rider remains  
standing. It doesn't seem like Assassin has been able  
to make any dent in him whatsoever.)   
  
**Makiri:**  
(If we bring in more transfer bombs to this place,  
it might be possible to end all these scums' lives at  
once&mdash;)   
  
**Kama:**  
Hey, you old fart, don't just stand there like you have  
all the time in the world to peacefully ponder about  
retirement plans.   
  
**Kama:**  
You do realize you're part of this battle too, don't you?   
  
**Makiri:**  
What...is this...?   
  
**Makiri:**  
A Bounded Field!? When...  
Are these, flowers...!?   
  
**Kama:**  
I've been shooting off flower arrows this whole time.  
Did you really think I missed all those shots?   
  
**Kama:**  
Well, I did, but on purpose. I grew them bit by bit,  
so that they would neatly surround your current  
position.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Ha! They're just flowers, but my bugs&mdash;!   
  
**Kama:**  
Of course they are, but I'm doing this specifically to  
trap every last one of your bugs.   
  
**Kama:**  
It might not be visible, but within me smoulders a  
raging flame.   
  
**Kama:**  
I just have to use the Vajra, and&mdash;   
  
**Makiri:**  
What the!?   
  
**Kama:**  
Trust me. I mean, really trust me, when I say&mdash;   
  
**Kama:**  
For some reason I don't know, I longed with my whole  
being to be able to burn all those bugs to ashes.   
  
**Kama:**  
So I'm glad I finally got to do this♡   
  
**Makiri:**  
Aaaaaghh&mdash;! Why won't this blaze subside!?  
My bugs will...!   
  
**Kama:**  
Don't expect it to go out so easily. I mean, if it did,  
it wouldn't be much of an inconvenience for me either.   
  
**Makiri:**  
Ah...aaaaaaaaaa...!   
  
**Makiri:**  
You bitch... How...how dare you...!   
  
**Makiri:**  
Gha...aaaaaaaaahhhhh&mdash;!   
  
**Kama:**  
Using my flowers like this...perhaps I got the idea  
when I saw those girls again.   
  
**Kama:**  
Well, I have more of them than I would know what to  
do with.   
  
**Kama:**  
But you made it so my loving tips were all for nothing.   
  
**Kama:**  
And you're the one who has to pay for that.  
Get it, old man?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Doryaaa!   
  
**Sion:**  
Just like that, we've broken free from our state of  
negligence. We tackled the problem head-on with all  
our might, and any sign of that elderly Master has  
finally disappeared in full.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Wahaha! It's a huge win for Rider too! Now,  
the finishing blow...   
  
**Kama:**  
There's no need for that. He's already about to  
disappear.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
H-haa... Assassin...Berserker...   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
My...thanks.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Oh? I thought for sure you'd start complaining about  
losin'.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
I fought here not as a warrior, but a mere tool.  
I had no right to stake my boasting on such things as  
victory or defeat.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Nevertheless, though I presented myself under a  
pretense of evil...   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
No, precisely because I did so&mdash;falling to true evil  
inflicted on me a pain beyond salvation.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
And for ending that, I am most thankful to you.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
...  
...   
  
**Narration:**  
Approaching my final moments, I could now see  
clearly.   
  
**Narration:**  
I recognized the me here as the same me who met his  
end in days past.   
  
**Narration:**  
My lord. I have waged war for your sake all this time.  
I have waged war for my country.   
  
**Narration:**  
I truly harbor no ulterior motives. All this valiance,  
this strenuous work, it is all devoted to you.   
  
**Narration:**  
Not a single sliver for myself.   
  
**Narration:**  
Why can you not place faith in me? Why&mdash;why  
do you suspect I covet your position...   
  
**Narration:**  
Why? Why? Why?  
Why? Why? Why?   
  
**Narration:**  
What I believed in, all that I devoted, the jealousy,  
the distrust, ostracization, being the target of so much  
hostility...   
  
**Narration:**  
It is all very painful.   
  
**Narration:**  
Oh, if only things were different.   
  
**Narration:**  
Had I only not been a hero.   
  
**Narration:**  
Would it be possible to make that reality now?   
  
**Narration:**  
If it meant he would finally trust me, that this agony  
would finally subside...   
  
**Narration:**  
I would let evil tarnish all the honors and deeds of my  
past&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
...  
...   
  
**Narration:**  
But, in the end,   
  
**Narration:**  
as it was a result of my ineptitude, I could not accept  
true evil.   
  
**Narration:**  
At most, I was only able to become the mouthpiece of  
a false evil, claiming that name in lieu of escapism and  
derangement.   
  
**Narration:**  
That is who I am, then as now.   
  
**Narration:**  
Even now I drink down that hackneyed pretense of  
evil, entering sleep with only its bitter taste remaining  
on my tongue&mdash;   
  
**Kama:**  
It's not like I was doing it to hear you thank me...   
  
**Kama:**  
But I mean, what reason could you have had to join up  
with such a vile Master?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
How did that guy become a Master again?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
What about Lainur?  
  
---  
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Ah, right. There is something I must tell you.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
My original Master, he was...wiped out. He was  
attacked and murdered by someone.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
I failed to protect him. What I'm about to tell you may  
sound like an excuse for my inability, but it is fact.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
The blow was delivered from an extreme distance.  
That sort of power and accuracy would be impossible  
were it not a Servant's attack.   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Consequently, I believe...   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
It is possible that in this world, there exists an Archer  
class Servant.   
  
**Everyone:**  
&mdash;!?   
  
**Gao Changgong:**  
Be on your guard. Perhaps we have been deceived  
from the very start...   
  
**Kama:**  
What...does this mean?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Archer, huh? There's nothing like that here.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I know a class like that should exist, but based on the  
fundamental information I received as part of my  
summoning,   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
it doesn't exist in this place. I've sure never seen them.   
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Greetings to all. I'm contacting you as part of my  
duties as overseer of the System Grail War.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The complete disappearance of Servant Rider's Spirit  
Core has just been confirmed. The performers of this  
task were&mdash;   
  
**Kama:**  
I was the one who took out the Master, no?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Yours truly landed the last blow on that guy, no!?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Though it is a delicate subject...the Servant battle will  
be prioritized in terms of importance. The win goes to  
Berserker.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Awright!   
  
**Kama:**  
HUH!?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Consequently, the Master of Berserker, prime AI of  
Repair,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
will be delegated the authority over both the Transfer  
and Build partitions, previously possessed by Rider's  
Master.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Following this, the partitions will be consolidated.  
A new Repair-Transfer-Build partition will emerge.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Preparations for converting the world in such a  
manner are already underway. Rather, as this process  
has already been executed once, preparations are  
already complete.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Let the wheels of the world turn.  
Good fortune to you all.   
  
**Kama:**  
HUH!? (Repeating herself)   
  
**Sion:**  
Duryodhana, get Ayus!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
O-on it!   
  
**Kama:**  
Jeez, not again!   
  
## Section 11: Cradle Testament/whoever  
  
### Arrow 1 Pre-Battle  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Phew...  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
I know it's essential that you keep  
Fujimaru safe, but is it really necessary to  
be so intimate with [♂ him /♀️ her] every time?   
  
**Kama:**  
It's only an added extra...  
Ahem, just preparing for the worst.   
  
**Kama:**  
Right, safety ought to be 200% assured.   
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...   
  
**Sion:**  
Well, fine. At least this time... Ayus and Berserker look  
to have landed much closer by.   
  
**Sion:**  
Let's regroup as soon as we can.   
  
**Ayus:**  
You're telling me my jurisdiction increased this much  
while I was sleeping!?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That's all courtesy of yours truly. Show some  
gratitude.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Th-Thank you?   
  
**Kama:**  
He's lying to you. About half the result came from my  
efforts. I would say that you stole Rider's share too.   
  
**Sion:**  
Either way, you now have control over the activities of  
Build and Transfer in addition to Repair.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I suppose. I still consider myself a medical type,  
but I can deal with those like subtasks.   
  
**Ayus:**  
It looks like I can communicate with and manage  
deployments of the AIs in all three areas too.  
Yeah, it's really quite handy!   
  
**Sion:**  
Then the current partition framework should look like  
this.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Uh-huh. Looking at this, my area of access is massive.  
With responsibilities to match...   
  
**Sion:**  
Accordingly, the benefits we're getting from it ought  
to be considered significant.   
  
**Sion:**  
The advantage being the greater amount of tasks that  
can be safely tackled. For the time being, our next  
course...   
  
**Sion:**  
Why don't we help some AIs with their work and  
replenish our Raniment as we head out?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
"Head out", to where?  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
To one of our home bases? Repair, I hope?   
  
**Sion:**  
Oh, no. We'll be making for the church, in the heart of  
Defend.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...You mean the Archer thing. You mean to ask the  
general supervisor AI about that?   
  
**Sion:**  
If I can. After all, it's her who must have the most  
detailed intel about the Servants in this world.   
  
**Sion:**  
We should also interpret Rider's last words with  
Ayus&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
Well, do you think there really is an Archer?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I feel the same. Couldn't it be that Rider was just  
confused while on the verge of death?   
  
**Sion:**  
That's certainly possible, but there's no harm in being  
sure of it first.   
  
**Kama:**  
No comment from me.   
  
**Sion:**  
In any case, restocking our fuel is the priority now.   
  
**Sion:**  
If you wouldn't mind tracking the movements of the  
AIs under your purview, Ayus, and refine how precisely  
we can search for jobs that could use our help?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Okay, then let's get a move on! Follow me!   
  
### Arrow 1 Post-Battle  
  
**Rani-B:**  
...Appreciated.   
  
**Ayus:**  
And thank you! Oh, you don't need to give me more  
than this, it's too much!   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...Previous stipulation: Hand over the quantity nearest  
to vanishing point.   
  
**Kama:**  
I guess it used to be...that Build was originally the  
stomping grounds for that brat Master of Caster, huh?   
  
**Kama:**  
They must have been bled dry.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Well, that won't happen again with me as prime AI!   
  
**Ayus:**  
I've been wanting to be like a family&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
I should say that the girls of Build are already family  
now! At least to me!   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...Once again.  
...Appreciated.   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...By the way, is this the Master of Assassin?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I am.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Nice working with you!  
  
---  
  
**Rani-B:**  
...I asked, regarding the transfer of authority for  
Build's prime AI.   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...Wondering if you also played a big part in it.   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...Appreciated as well.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
&ndash;I just did what I wanted to.  
  
---  
  
**Rani-B:**  
...Realization. Another form of gratitude to give other  
than Raniment.   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...There are raw materials here.  
...Can I make something?   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...I would like to. If so, please specify parameters such  
as form, function, et cetera.   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...I could do it for all of you.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Oh? I'm happy you're asking, but my medical tools all  
made it in one piece. Well...hmm. I can't think of  
anything on the spot.   
  
**Ayus:**  
How about whatever you think is best?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Yeah, same!  
  
---  
  
**Rani-B:**  
...I see.  
...Then commencing operation.   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...Complete.  
...If you will.   
  
**Ayus:**  
This is...a small game piece, I think?  
Hm, a medical bag. Is this meant to be me?   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...Affirmative.  
...It is an original chess piece.   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...You can substitute it for a king or queen.  
...Or use it as an original kind of piece.   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...The movements for mine, by the way, I like to  
configure with both queen's and knight's.   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...Because it's nice to be the strongest.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
There's a chibi me too...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Thanks!  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Oh, you have one for me as well? Thanks for the idol  
worship.   
  
**Kama:**  
Would I be a long-distance attacker? Or perhaps a  
charm-type who converts the pieces I attack?   
  
**Sion:**  
The affinity between AI and chess bears little  
repeating.   
  
**Sion:**  
We thought it could be used to improve computer  
performance. Fascinating.   
  
**Sion:**  
...Though truth be told, I'd call it a better resemblance  
if the head were only smaller proportionate to the  
body.   
  
**Sion:**  
But the workmanship is first-rate. Thank you very  
much.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Wait one second.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Isn't mine the only one that looks choppy?  
Like the polygon count is super lower than the rest of  
yours?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
For some reason, the modelling comes off as sloppy  
too!   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...Unintentional.  
...Misallocation of materials.   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...Running short by the end.  
...Sloppy modelling a figment of your imagination.   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...The matter of yours being the only scary attitude.  
...Likely not related at all.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Is that a fact?   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...On a side note, being unable to move a single square  
is very rare indeed.   
  
**Rani-B:**  
...Amazing.  
...Unprecedented.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I'm still picking up sass from you!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Since you got everything about it wrong, I'll fix this  
thing's values up right.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Blam! Duryodhana, the strongest unit! Put it down on  
the board and all your opponents prostrate before its  
prestige and be wiped out! How 'bout that!   
  
**F：Rani-B:**  
...Heh.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Snickering at me, are ya?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Is she really acting like a subordinate of yours should?  
Maybe you wanna double-check your authority?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Either way... This really turned out well.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I'd say so!  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
All right then, let's keep moving on to our next  
resupply!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Why don't we head for Transfer next?   
  
### Arrow 2 Post Battle  
  
[Battle]  
  
**A：Rani-T:**  
You are truly a S P E E D S T E R.   
  
**B：Rani-T:**  
Like a wolf or a dragon... It is agreeable to see such an  
illusion of S P E E D. Very nice.   
  
**Ayus:**  
These ones Transfer use feel pretty good. Maybe I'll  
get one made for myself one of these days.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Is that much okay? It's not too much to ask for, is it?   
  
**A：Rani-T:**  
...As a B O N U S.   
  
**B：Rani-T:**  
Though from now on, I believe you may be a one-way  
S P E E D S T E R.   
  
**Ayus:**  
...It'll be fine. I definitely won't end up crashing and  
burning on it.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I'll just be going like the wind!   
  
**A：Rani-T:**  
How reassuring.   
  
**B：Rani-T:**  
In celebration of our stable situation, we shall now  
hold a long-awaited competition.   
  
**Kama:**  
A competition?   
  
**A：Rani-T:**  
A contest of speed where the participants run like the  
wind. Simply put, a race.   
  
**A：Rani-T:**  
Of course, you are welcome to join as guest  
participants.   
  
**B：Rani-T:**  
Incidentally, because there is no fundamental  
difference in performance between each AI,   
  
**B：Rani-T:**  
the time difference between each participant is never  
more than 1/100th of a second. It is a D E A D H E A T.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hey, that's just boring.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hmm. Well, it seems like the fastest one here is  
Berserker, right? Go get 'em out there!   
  
**Kama:**  
He ought to be fast, since he's such a show-off.  
I don't particularly care.   
  
**Sion:**  
Shall I boost you with my Etherlight? It will likely tear  
all your muscles, but I consider that a necessary  
sacrifice.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I'm rooting for you!  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
How am I supposed to win this!?  
I'm running a foot race against bikers!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
There's nothing I hate more than contests rigged  
against me!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Then again, it's no fun losing something I thought I'd  
win for sure either. Aah, I just hate losing in general!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Wait...more importantly, if this is a race...that means  
betting.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You can count me in for that.  
Actually, I'll be the one taking the bets.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
It doesn't matter what the odds are, the bookie  
always makes a profit. Gehehehe....   
  
**Ayus:**  
All right, all right. No crazy schemes allowed!   
  
**Ayus:**  
He really is an addict, isn't he?  
Didn't he win big a long time ago?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(Not without cheating.)  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Anyway, let's enjoy this little competition, then move  
on to our next stop!   
  
### Arrow 3 Post-Battle  
  
[Battle]  
  
**A：Rani-R:**  
Great. Your skill lives up to your station.   
  
**B：Rani-R:**  
Congratulations on your return.  
Take in the comforts of your hometown.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Mm. Whatever else happens, I'm the most in my  
element when working in Repair. Ah, the joy of labor!   
  
**Kama:**  
After all the work I did, I'm about full to bursting.   
  
**Kama:**  
I suppose all of our preparations are ready?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Somehow, it feels like we're back to where we started.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Without any more violent sorts like Caster in the  
picture, we ought to be able to fight a civil Holy Grail  
War at this point.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Whenever we're ready, we can go to our opponents  
and challenge them fair and square! Is that how duels  
go?   
  
**Sion:**  
That's about how it'll go, as long as nobody exploits  
each other's weak points.   
  
**Sion:**  
We won't take action, at least not until all our  
unfinished business is out of the way first.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Still dwelling on that? As long as your stomach's full,  
you might as well be ready to take on any comers.   
  
**Sion:**  
We're entitled to a fair understanding of the battle's  
ins and outs.   
  
**Sion:**  
It was made clear to us that five Servants were part of  
the design, with Assassin&ndash;Kama as an unplanned  
entrant.   
  
**Sion:**  
So there's no guarantee that a second irregularity  
hasn't occurred as well.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's unknown to me as well how likely it is that an  
Archer really exists,   
  
**Sion:**  
but if we have the chance, then we ought to make sure.   
  
**Sion:**  
If the condition to end this Holy Grail War is “to have  
one remaining Servant”,   
  
**Sion:**  
then any mistake in assuming how many Servants are  
in play would bring about deadly consequences.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Fine, I see your reasoning.   
  
**Sion:**  
There's still a realistic possibility that the remaining  
Lancer or Saber...   
  
**Sion:**  
...assassinated Rider's Master with a long-range  
attack we know nothing about.   
  
**Sion:**  
About Lancer...Bhima that is, what's your opinion  
about him as an acquaintance?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...He's the son of Vayu, god of the winds. That's what  
the spear he was carrying should be based on.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
He could likely do a long-distance attack if he wanted,  
but it's probably not in his nature to&ndash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Ah! Hold on, don't ask me!  
I got NOTHING to say about that guy!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I didn't dwell on him in life, and I care even less about  
the weirdo he apparently is now! Hmph!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Anyway, let's go. We haven't got time to spare!   
  
**Ayus:**  
I don't know what happened, but hearing about  
Lancer now seems to set him off worse than ever.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I wonder what's changed...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hey, wait for me!   
  
### Arrow 4 Pre-Battle  
  
**Sion:**  
This had great timing.   
  
**Kama:**  
Having to beat up a bunch of bugs that showed up out  
of nowhere? That's just a hassle.   
  
**Sion:**  
Not when the one who'd originally be tasked to do  
the job is due to drop in.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Oh, it's DX.   
  
**DX:**  
Conjecture: You've assisted with another mission.  
My thanks.   
  
**Sion:**  
I'm glad to see you. Originally, my plan was pinned on  
meeting with you as well as Rani XII.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(That's right. If there is an Archer in this world,)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(then the leading Master candidate would be the remaining prime AI.)  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
I just want to say up front that this is to confirm  
something, so I'll be quick&mdash;   
  
**DX:**  
Warning: Unauthorized internal connection to this  
unit is prohibited. Any further action will be interpreted  
as hostile.   
  
**Sion:**  
There goes the second phase of my no-point-in-  
arguing strategy.   
  
**Sion:**  
Now then&ndash;if you'll excuse me, could you please  
take off your armor and show us your body?   
  
**Sion:**  
Even in this world's Holy Grail War, a Command Spell  
is the fundamental right for a Master. Confirming that  
should expedite things.   
  
**DX:**  
...  
...   
  
**DX:**  
Meaning unknown. Be that as it may,   
  
**DX:**  
I'll ask if this satisfies you?   
  
**Sion:**  
...It doesn't look to be hidden by underclothes either.   
  
**Sion:**  
That'll do. Let me apologize.   
  
**Kama:**  
True, if there were an Archer then that thing there  
would be its Master.   
  
**Kama:**  
After all, she's the only prime AI with an area under  
her control that's not a Master.   
  
**Kama:**  
But if we're wrong about this, isn't it Rider's  
falsehood in the end?   
  
**Sion:**  
...That may be so.   
  
**Sion:**  
Now that we've seen to the likeliest possibility,  
its priority has dropped.   
  
**Sion:**  
Nevertheless, there's more to glean on the matter.   
  
**Sion:**  
I'd still like to interview Rani XII as planned and hear  
as close to the last word as we can before deciding on  
our next move&mdash;   
  
**DX:**  
...Heads-up!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Woah, they came out of nowhere! What the hell are  
these things!?   
  
**DX:**  
Not bugs. Be that as it may, it's judged that they are  
aiming for AIs in the center partition.   
  
**DX:**  
Elimination recommended due to breach of  
regulations&mdash;Requesting cooperation!   
  
**Ayus:**  
W-We're in!   
  
### Arrow 4 Post-Battle  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(The way it vanished...)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(Have I seen this before?)  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
What's with the doggies?   
  
**Kama:**  
I can feel another major annoyance coming our way.   
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Why was that enemy attacking the AIs?   
  
**Ayus:**  
If it's for Raniment...then they're no different from  
Caster.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Why would this happen now that Caster and that  
Master of his are gone?   
  
**DX:**  
...Understood.   
  
**Sion:**  
Have you gotten any answers from the D-type  
communications?   
  
**DX:**  
This unit's next action depends on the General  
Supervisor's instructions&mdash;   
  
**DX:**  
But the Defend network acquired some level of data  
about the beastly threat we fought.   
  
**DX:**  
Based on my risk management routines, this unit will  
share the information with you.   
  
**DX:**  
These beastly threats are indiscriminately attacking  
AIs in all partitions of the world in attempt to collect  
Raniment.   
  
**DX:**  
And their source is...Grow.   
  
**DX:**  
In conclusion, this can be assumed to be a  
transgression by Saber&mdash;   
  
## Section 12: Sakura's Dream/I hate love.  
  
### Arrow 1 Pre-Battle  
  
**Narration:**  
Who am I?   
  
**Narration:**  
What a foolish question.  
From the get-go, I'm an ambiguous existence.   
  
**Narration:**  
It is almost solely a question of my role.   
  
**Narration:**  
The chronology, the memories, the causality,  
the recollections&mdash;they are all ambiguous.   
  
**Narration:**  
Some parts overlap each other.  
Some parts contradict each other.   
  
**Narration:**  
However, the only constant is my role.   
  
**Narration:**  
A monster.   
  
**Narration:**  
That's what I am. No matter how many versions of me  
there are, that part will probably never change.   
  
**Narration:**  
A me which has become a demon who devours all;  
a me related to the Pegasus.   
  
**Narration:**  
There could even be a me who is “the youngest among  
the sister goddesses”, remaining similar to my two  
goddess sisters.   
  
**Narration:**  
But no matter what, there is no escaping the fate of  
being a monster.   
  
**Narration:**  
So the question is rather: What kind of monster am I  
now?   
  
**Narration:**  
Just as another me is related to the Pegasus,  
this me is related to the Golden Sword's Monster  
—Chrysaor.   
  
**Narration:**  
That's fine.   
  
**Narration:**  
With Chrysaor being the father of many a monster,  
the concept of being the ancestor of the bloodline of  
demons came to me easily.   
  
**Narration:**  
That's also fine.   
  
**Narration:**  
What's not fine is the other stuff which has been  
haphazardly integrated.   
  
**Narration:**  
I've thought a lot.   
  
**Narration:**  
About Poseidon, and about Athena. I've thought hard  
about the gods, in blazing passion.   
  
**Narration:**  
To put it in other words: I've committed to memory  
the reason why I became a monster.   
  
**Narration:**  
This me is the most suited to considering that outset.  
Indeed&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
Whether it's divine or not, I detest love.   
  
**Narration:**  
If it wasn't for that sort of thing, I might have never  
become a monster.   
  
**Narration:**  
I could have continued to live an idyllic life with my  
two beloved sisters, until the end of time.   
  
**Narration:**  
That's why&mdash;I was reluctant.   
  
**Narration:**  
When I was first summoned to this world by that  
Master, I was reluctant with her.   
  
**Narration:**  
To the best of my ability, I avoided coming into  
contact with her.   
  
**Narration:**  
Conversations were kept to a minimum.   
  
**Narration:**  
I repeatedly made the appeal that I was here to do my  
job; to fulfill my contract.   
  
**Narration:**  
But it was no use.   
  
**Narration:**  
Because she approached me from another direction.  
Because she looked at me with those eyes oh so  
similar to my own.   
  
**Narration:**  
Yes&mdash;that's why I was reluctant.   
  
**Narration:**  
If I opened my heart, this girl would, without fail,  
become the love of my life.   
  
**Narration:**  
I knew it well.   
  
**Narration:**  
Why should I have to flee, to curse that horror,  
to hope never to be touched again?   
  
**Narration:**  
All of that is just too painful. It's unbearable, terrifying,  
contrary to my very existence.   
  
**Narration:**  
But, even so&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
Now that I have become self-conscious about it,  
there is no turning back.   
  
**Narration:**  
After all, I'm...   
  
**Narration:**  
I'm nothing but an unsightly monster which prioritizes  
its own greed over what is right.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Medusa...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Saber...!  
  
---  
  
**Medusa:**  
You've finally come. If anyone were to face me here,  
I believed it would be you.   
  
**Ayus:**  
What's...going on?   
  
**Ayus:**  
What's gotten into you? I mean, we fought Caster  
together.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I know you know that what you're doing to the AIs is  
wrong&mdash;   
  
**Medusa:**  
Do not misconstrue my actions.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I did what I did because my Master commanded it.  
Because it is what Sakura yearned for.   
  
**Medusa:**  
None of it holds any significance other than that.   
  
**Kama:**  
So what's the deal right now? Is this all according to  
her will? Actually, where even is she?   
  
**Medusa:**  
Sakura is asleep further inside.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hold on. I can't see her too clearly, but her breathing  
definitely looks weird.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Let me take a look at her!   
  
**Medusa:**  
I shall not permit your approach. I fully comprehend  
her situation.   
  
**Medusa:**  
&mdash;Raniment deficiency.   
  
**Sion:**  
...!?   
  
**Medusa:**  
At this point, she only retains the minimum amount of  
Raniment needed to maintain her structure as an AI.   
  
**Medusa:**  
As things stand, she lacks the energy to stand up and  
move about.   
  
**Medusa:**  
No, if this persists, then&mdash;she will cease  
existence before long.   
  
**Ayus:**  
T-then we have to get her help immediately!   
  
**Ayus:**  
I've got a bit of food materials on me, and some of us  
could lend her some Raniment, and...   
  
**Medusa:**  
You are quite the curious AI, are you not? She is an  
enemy Master. Is this your base programming as a  
Repair AI interfering?   
  
**Medusa:**  
Regardless&mdash;were it possible to resupply her,  
conversing would be simple. Alas, such a thing is  
beyond our means.   
  
**Medusa:**  
As she is now, any Raniment she receives is  
automatically redirected to her Servant.   
  
**Medusa:**  
In other words, to me.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...!  
  
---  
  
**Medusa:**  
I will go as far as to agree I made an error.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I failed to notice. Until some stage of the war,  
it remained unvarying.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Whatever she ingested from materials; whatever she  
received from other AIs&mdash;   
  
**Medusa:**  
Whatever Raniment that Sakura was bequeathed,   
  
**Medusa:**  
she first and foremost prioritized funneling the largest  
possible amount to me, her Servant.   
  
**Medusa:**  
What minimal amount of Raniment remained,  
she utilized to maintain her structure as an AI.   
  
**Medusa:**  
It never subceded the minimal amount to do so.  
Natheless, at some point in time, a momentary  
deficiency arose.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Like when she let me join the picnic...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Because I ate her share...?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
That can't be it. I'm positive I saw her eat food as well  
back then.   
  
**Sion:**  
It would not have been a case of resource scarcity or  
anything.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Wait, you said “until some stage”. Do you mean&mdash;   
  
**Medusa:**  
The first skirmish with Caster's familiars, wherein she  
was wounded.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Yes, correct... Ever since you administered her  
treatment.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ah! I knew the post-treatment effects were strange!   
  
**Ayus:**  
She was seriously wounded back then.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I managed to completely treat the AI part of her,   
  
**Ayus:**  
but the recently implanted Master part was made up  
of a bunch of unknown mechanisms.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I had no choice but to do what I could, and then just  
observe what impact that might have had...   
  
**Medusa:**  
Indeed. Most regrettably, it was these left-out parts  
that posed an issue.   
  
**Medusa:**  
After she performed a physical examination,  
I forcibly questioned the performant R-type.   
  
**Medusa:**  
It appeared there was a fault with the internal system  
which constituted the “pathway” through which  
Raniment flowed to her Servant.   
  
**Medusa:**  
It was implied to have suffered damage.   
  
**Medusa:**  
The explanation I received was the emergence of  
numerous holes within the hose which connected  
Sakura and myself.   
  
**Medusa:**  
As Raniment flowed through, a substantial amount  
would be lost as it seeped out of these holes.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Thus, in order to amend the issue and return to normal  
levels of Raniment supplying,   
  
**Medusa:**  
she had no course available to her other than simply  
letting an inordinate amount flow through to make up  
for what was lost.   
  
**Medusa:**  
This amount would have been taken from the pool  
originally reserved for herself.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Were I not the fool, I would have realized sooner.   
  
**Medusa:**  
As she proceeded to divert increasingly larger  
amounts of Raniment to allow me to fight with all my  
might,   
  
**Medusa:**  
I noticed she was staggering, barely able to walk.  
That is when I sensed something was abnormal.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I told her taking care of herself was of utmost priority,  
but conversely, she&mdash;   
  
**Kama:**  
I remember. The second time the Supersized Worm  
Fiend appeared, she used a Command Spell on you,  
didn't she?   
  
**Medusa:**  
Yes. Why did Sakura act the way she did? Why did  
she use that Command Spell? These questions hold the  
same answer.   
  
**Medusa:**  
She had to protect this place to which she belonged.  
That is what she relied on me for, and what she  
entrusted me with. That is all&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
Why didn't you say anything...!? There were plenty of  
opportunities!   
  
**Ayus:**  
I explicitly told the both of you to alert me if any  
unexpected malfunction happened...!   
  
**Medusa:**  
I inquired about this fact myself, but ultimately,  
it was Sakura's decision. She likely had several  
reasons.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Something the R-type who examined her noted; so  
fundamental that perhaps not even the prime herself  
could have diagnosed it.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Sakura herself would have felt this way too.   
  
**Ayus:**  
That's not... If you'd just let me examine her again,  
I could...   
  
**Medusa:**  
Perhaps she felt inclined not to be any more in debt  
to one who was for all intents and purposes her enemy.   
  
**Medusa:**  
And...Sakura had laughingly said:   
  
**Medusa:**  
“No matter how defective I become,   
  
**Medusa:**  
I wouldn't want to replace my duty to protect this  
place for the sake of my own appearance.“   
  
**Medusa:**  
“I want to do as much as possible by myself.  
&mdash;Even if it's just some unintentional result of my  
ego.”   
  
**Ayus:**  
...  
...   
  
**E：Medusa:**  
“Protect my home,” she had ordered with the  
Command Spell.   
  
**E：Medusa:**  
That same Command Spell remains effective yet.  
At the very least, it would appear so.   
  
**E：Medusa:**  
I shall protect this partition, and doing so is analogous  
to protecting Sakura herself.   
  
**E：Medusa:**  
Thus, I shall protect her at all costs.   
  
**E：Medusa:**  
Even should it entail sacrificing the AIs outside of  
Grow.   
  
**E：Medusa:**  
Were I to utilize the magical beasts born of this sword,   
  
**E：Medusa:**  
to retrieve an amount of Raniment so extensive it  
surpasses the amount consumed, and deliver it to  
Sakura all at once, then...she will most assuredly  
awaken.   
  
**E：Medusa:**  
There is no other way!   
  
**Ayus:**  
I know how you must feel right now, but...  
But&mdash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
No. I agree, this is the way.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Huh?   
  
**G：Duryodhana:**  
It's a thought that's crossed my mind before.  
At the end of the day, I can only really understand my  
own desires.   
  
**G：Duryodhana:**  
And yet we still think about everyone else. What's  
even the point of giving in to them?   
  
**G：Duryodhana:**  
Even if you have a good reason, and resign yourself in  
the most intelligent way possible...wouldn't you feel  
regretful about your own desires?   
  
**G：Duryodhana:**  
That's why I think it's okay for you to act the way you  
want.   
  
**G：Duryodhana:**  
Do whatever you want. Take whatever you want.  
That's just the natural way of things.   
  
**G：Duryodhana:**  
However&mdash;   
  
**G：Duryodhana:**  
It shouldn't be a surprise that it'll conflict with the  
wants of others.   
  
**G：Duryodhana:**  
Whose desires will win out in the end will depend on a  
bunch of things. Social status, strength, economic clout,  
and so on.   
  
**G：Duryodhana:**  
Since yours truly is an elite possessing all the above,  
I naturally get whatever I want.   
  
**G：Duryodhana:**  
And this time won't be any different. What I want is to  
win the Holy Grail War, and to have it all.   
  
**G：Duryodhana:**  
That is to say, all these other AIs are my future  
property. I won't have anyone else lay their filthy paws  
on them!   
  
**Kama:**  
It's so self-centered it passes over into honourable.  
Desires are a slippery slope to lapse. I have to praise  
it, hehe.   
  
**Sion:**  
Being who I am, I will resort to logic rather than  
sentiment. Whatever the case, our plan was to face off  
against Saber and Lancer next.   
  
**Sion:**  
Then there is no point in backing down here.  
We should just see it as convenient that she lacks  
backup from her Master.   
  
**Sion:**  
We should take her out here and now.   
  
**Kama:**  
Woah, that's mad cold.   
  
**Kama:**  
Master, I'm okay with either way. Just do what would  
make you happy.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
If leaving her means hurting AIs indiscriminately...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
We can't let her continue...!  
  
---  
  
**Medusa:**  
Assassin, with your face looking the same, I do not  
wish to kill you. However, those are merely feelings.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Should you intervene, I shall mete out no mercy.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I shall save Sakura. I must save her&mdash;this time,  
for certain.   
  
**Kama:**  
You say that like someone else saved her before.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I do not comprehend the meaning of my words,  
but it is how I feel.   
  
**Medusa:**  
No... I understand. The fact that I want to save her  
myself, rather than let it be someone else who cares for  
her,   
  
**Medusa:**  
the fact that I feel I must save her by myself,   
  
**Medusa:**  
it is a narrow, foolish, self-conceited shortsightedness.   
  
**Medusa:**  
If not, I cannot have what it is I truly want&mdash;   
  
**Medusa:**  
That is how I feel&ndash;the way my ego manifests.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Regardless, the way I am now, I desire it.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hah, right on!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That said, I don't know how many doggies you've got  
out and about collecting Raniment for you,   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
but I doubt you have much to spare right now.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Not to mention, the more you use to fight, the less you  
have for the sake of waking up your Master, right?  
You might as well give up now.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I will make use of whatever can fill the gap.  
No matter how aggravating its power may appear.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Until now, I have only evoked it when using my Noble  
Phantasm, but now it shall have to deliberately drape  
myself in it perpetually.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Now, I shall devour you, intertwined in my causality.  
Grant me its use, Athena!   
  
**Medusa:**  
The brilliance of the golden sword brandished by a  
monster who feasted on divine elements, and fathered  
many a monster.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Burn it into your memory as you suffer death.   
  
**Medusa:**  
&mdash;The one birthed of mine own blood alongside  
the Pegasus.  
&mdash;The one brandishing the blade which fathered  
monsters.   
  
**Medusa:**  
The light inherited by we who curse the gods.  
Mine Mystic Eyes shall bless thee.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Monster's Golden Sword—Chrysaor!   
  
[Battle]  
  
### Arrow 2 Pre-Battle  
  
**Medusa:**  
Ggh...!   
  
**Medusa:**  
Agh... You're not her...but your similarities are  
certainly undeniable...   
  
**Kama:**  
I don't know what, but something in me kept dulling  
your blade down to the very end.   
  
**Kama:**  
That's just how I am. Your holding back doesn't make  
me hold back. Unlucky you.   
  
**Kama:**  
Other than this... I don't know what you did wrong.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Hehe... Hehehe.   
  
**Medusa:**  
How strange. I who wanted anything but love am  
going this far for love.   
  
**Medusa:**  
'Twas a factor I knew I meant to avoid, as it would  
certainly invite my death. Nonetheless&mdash;   
  
**Medusa:**  
When I see it before me, I impulsively refuse to let it go.  
This thorny temptation.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Pray tell, god of love. Is this what love is?   
  
**Kama:**  
...  
...   
  
**Kama:**  
Who knows?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...! What are you doing? She's trying to escape!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Ey!   
  
**Kama:**  
Oops, my bad. How careless of me♡   
  
**Sion:**  
Still, she was gravely wounded. Her Spirit Core is on  
the verge of being damaged.   
  
**Sion:**  
I don't believe she'll get very far. Let's pursue her.   
  
**Ayus:**  
...Yeah. She might start attacking innocent AIs again if  
we leave her be.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I can tell that nothing can get her to give up.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Hehe. Saber...   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
...!   
  
**H：Sakura:**  
You look so dashing in this outfit... Carrying me in your  
arms, jumping around...   
  
**H：Sakura:**  
It's like you're... Prince Charming.   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
Sakura. So you've snapped out of your slumber.  
How do you feel?   
  
**H：Sakura:**  
I'm fine. I'm as&mdash;healthy as can be.   
  
**H：Sakura:**  
Look, I'm as full of energy as ever...  
I can even let out a...“Heya” if I try.   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
...  
...   
  
**H：Sakura:**  
But... You never know when I'm going to fall asleep  
again.   
  
**H：Sakura:**  
So I gotta say it while I still can. Sorry and thank you,  
Saber. I'm...   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
I shan't listen to you.   
  
**H：Sakura:**  
What?   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
We are presently on the run.   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
This by no means indicates desistance.   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
Henceforth&ndash;this shan't be the end. We shall run as  
far as my legs can take us.   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
Then we will eventually get what you want...  
I'm sure of it.   
  
**H：Sakura:**  
But...run where?   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
Who knows? Any place you can survive.   
  
**Narration:**  
That's really all that there is to it.   
  
**Narration:**  
I will go anywhere and do anything to keep you alive.   
  
**Narration:**  
If you can't survive anywhere in this world, then I shall  
tear the walls of this world apart.   
  
**Narration:**  
Yes, I hope we may find paradise beyond the debris  
of this fake ceiling.   
  
**Narration:**  
I'm determined to make the world my enemy.  
I'm determined to destroy the world and live past it.   
  
**Narration:**  
I have&mdash;a mildly realistic idea on how to do so.   
  
**Medusa:**  
The general supervisor AI... Rani XII. As the Overseer,  
all the spare Command Spells must be in her hands.   
  
**Medusa:**  
If I can attack and steal them from her, then maybe...   
  
**Narration:**  
It happened the instant I decided where to jump to.   
  
**Narration:**  
Prohibited procedure detected.  
Requesting countermeasures.   
  
**Narration:**  
Partial permission granted. Direct removal is not  
approved at this stage.   
  
**Narration:**  
Thus, adapting response for compliance&ndash;I am only  
to take away her mobility.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Ggh...!   
  
**Sakura:**  
Saber! Oh no, your legs...! What was that!?   
  
**Medusa:**  
I don't...know!   
  
**Medusa:**  
(A long-distance attack. Clearly intended to maim  
instead of kill.)   
  
**Medusa:**  
(My legs were the intentional target. The blow was  
designed to take away my ability to escape.)   
  
**Medusa:**  
(Was it them again...? No.  
Lancer... Not him either.)   
  
**Medusa:**  
(Then who did it? And for what purpose?)   
  
**H：Sakura:**  
Saber, you can still run if you leave me behind.   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
Be not ridiculous, Sakura.   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
No, 'Tis our current enemy who is the most ridiculous  
of them all.   
  
**H：Sakura:**  
Saber...?   
  
**Medusa:**  
In all likelihood, the opponent is long beyond range.  
They're nowhere to be found.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Nonetheless, since their attacks reach us, the  
opponent is indubitably aware of our location...  
We're under watch.   
  
**Medusa:**  
That being the case, hope is not lost.   
  
**Medusa:**  
The original characteristic of my Mystic Eyes Cybele  
is to turn “those who look at me” into stone.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Ergo, if I'm being watched, the effect of petrification I  
unleash will trace their line of sight and reach  
them&mdash;   
  
**Medusa:**  
Don't interrupt me...   
  
**Medusa:**  
Max release&mdash;Cybele!   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
Gh-AH!   
  
**H：Sakura:**  
Saber!? Why!?   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
My Mystic Eyes were repelled...!? And for the return  
to be this powerful...   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
I know this intensity of magical energy and existence.  
&mdash;It's a Divine Spirit Servant...!   
  
**H：Sakura:**  
How is this possible...?   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
(Great question... How is this happening. No Servant  
fits the bill&mdash;)   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
(No, it's now confirmed they exist. Which would mean...)   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
We found them...!  
  
---  
  
**Medusa:**  
Right. That's how it is... The ones to deliver the mercy  
stroke have to be the participants of the Holy Grail War.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
What are you blabbering about? You're in no state to  
keep running. Accept your demise.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
It does feel like you're in an even worse state than  
before, but no matter...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I'll assume the wounds yours truly inflicted on you  
opened up more thanks to your pointless struggle to  
escape!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hwahaha, how tragic!   
  
**Kama:**  
Are you sure about that? I can't really believe that  
could cause damage on this level.   
  
**Sion:**  
Saber, were you perhaps...   
  
**Medusa:**  
To discuss my wounds with no intention to let me  
escape alive is futile.   
  
**Medusa:**  
&mdash;Have at me. As long as my body can still move,  
I won't give up.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Saber...!   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
Approach me not, Sakura.   
  
**F：Medusa:**  
Nothing is out of order. I will be by your side to my  
last breath&mdash;   
  
[Battle]   
  
### Arrow 3  
  
**Narration:**  
Who am I?   
  
**Narration:**  
Prime Grow AI. A participant in the System Grail War.  
Saber's Master.   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;Sakura.   
  
**Narration:**  
She gave me this name with no elaborate reasoning  
for it, but it felt like the perfect name for me.   
  
**Narration:**  
Ultimately, this name was a package for an emotion  
that never faded.   
  
**Narration:**  
The wish to protect my home.   
  
**Narration:**  
I can't explain why.   
  
**Narration:**  
This command was powerfully engraved in me from  
the start. I never had the option not to want this.   
  
**Narration:**  
I simply followed it wholeheartedly.   
  
**Narration:**  
For better or worse, that was only thing that gave my  
life worth.   
  
**Narration:**  
It was the proper foundation of existence, and I  
couldn't imagine myself doing anything else.   
  
**Narration:**  
What would a normal human call this? A desire?  
A preference? A fetish? Surely none of those things.   
  
**Narration:**  
It's something more primordial, more tied to the  
depths of the heart, more inescapable&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
Fate.   
  
**Narration:**  
Or maybe a curse.   
  
**Narration:**  
But I don't feel any pain, sorrow, or agony.  
That's just how I am because it is.   
  
**Narration:**  
Perhaps I always had this curse of fate&mdash;I was  
born someone with an precious home to protect.   
  
**Narration:**  
I regret nothing. How could I? That's my own wish  
beyond a wish.   
  
**Narration:**  
To keep protecting my precious home forever and  
always. And then one day&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
Ah, but...   
  
**Narration:**  
If I unwittingly imparted my selfish wish onto  
someone else,   
  
**Narration:**  
then I suppose I have to apologize...   
  
**Medusa:**  
...Sakura. Can you hear me, Sakura?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Sa...ber.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I'm...sorry...for forcing you to be the villain.   
  
**Sakura:**  
You're so much better suited...to be Prince Charming...   
  
**Medusa:**  
&ndash;No. You are seeing not past my appearances.  
Prince Charming, I am not.   
  
**Medusa:**  
...  
...   
  
**Medusa:**  
If you cannot believe me,   
  
**Medusa:**  
I'm going back to the way I usually talk, Sakura.   
  
**Sakura:**  
...Okay.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I like both versions of you, but...yeah, the usual Saber...   
  
**Medusa:**  
Yeah. I've always been the same. I'm your pet  
monster.   
  
**Medusa:**  
So you should have used me as you pleased.  
You have nothing to apologize for.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I'm sure...I was a monster too.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I only had one thing in mind and I would do anything  
for it.   
  
**Sakura:**  
But from anyone else's perspective, I was insane and  
what I cared about was meaningless&mdash;   
  
**Sakura:**  
I've indirectly hurt people.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Maybe, but you're wrong.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I was enough of a monster for both of us, so you  
wouldn't have to become a real monster.   
  
**Medusa:**  
You stayed yourself to the very end.   
  
**Medusa:**  
So&mdash;the two of us were perfectly balanced.   
  
**Sakura:**  
...Yeah.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Then... Let me thank you.   
  
**Sakura:**  
You who tried to be like me.   
  
**Sakura:**  
It must have been irritating...  
How I never...got used to the distance you wanted.   
  
**Sakura:**  
But thank you for always being with me.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I was...basically just being shy.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I was just...being brusque. Because I couldn't get used  
to the distance you wanted.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Really? I'm glad to hear.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I hope one day we can hang out again as friends,  
maybe have a picnic.   
  
**Sakura:**  
And we would return together...to our precious  
home&mdash;   
  
**Medusa:**  
True. I'm looking forward to it.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Time's up.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Don't worry about me, Sakura. I already said what  
needs to be said to them while you were asleep.   
  
**Medusa:**  
...And I have something I have to do next. Bye.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Bye... See you...later.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Seems like we're due another rotation because Saber  
disappeared.   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
Needless to say, I'll also...disappear.   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
Torn apart by the rotation or not...I'm out of Raniment,  
and my physical composition is too damaged.   
  
**Ayus:**  
...  
...   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
Please don't look at me like that. I'm sorry for making  
you worry.   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
It's not your fault. This was truly inevitable.   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
I'm truly glad you came to help me despite us officially  
being enemies.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Even then, as the prime Repair AI, I'm filled with  
frustration.   
  
**Ayus:**  
A wound that can't be healed is an admission of  
defeat for me.   
  
**Ayus:**  
If it's because of me that you turned out like this,  
then I absolutely can't see myself as the winner.   
  
**Ayus:**  
We're officially enemies, and that's why I wanted to  
settle things with an honorable duel. Not like this...   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
...I'm sorry.   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
I have...one last request.   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
Can I...be alone for a moment?  
I have something I want to...talk about.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Huh? Did you notice a little contradiction in that?   
  
**Kama:**  
Doesn't matter. Here, I'm leaving.   
  
**Kama:**  
I'll be busy preparing to be a cushion for Master.   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
They...aren't here...anymore.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...  
...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Hey...I&mdash;   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...Sorry.   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
What are you apologizing for?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Because I... I...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I noticed it. I noticed what was weird about you.  
Maybe before Saber did.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
How you were low on Raniment... About to pass out.   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
From my perspective, you keeping quiet was you doing  
what I wished for.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
No! I was the only one who noticed it. If I had told  
anyone&mdash;   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Things wouldn't have turned out like this. You and  
Saber...wouldn't have to go through all this...   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
It was inevitable. Don't you think you did exactly what  
you had to?   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
Did you forget, Cerejeira? You and I are technically  
enemies.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Yeah. I know that.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...Haha, that's weird.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
That's not making the guilt stop.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
It's all hopelessly disgusting...I hate it. I just want to  
throw up...and die...!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Talking to you is the last thing I wanted to do...  
The last thing I wanted to think about. But I still can't  
erase this from inside me...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
So I wanted to do something about it, but there was  
nothing I could do!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
And now... After everything is over, past the point of  
no return,   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I'm here with you, who was kinda nice to me despite  
me being like this.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I'm just here, having a pointless conversation with you,  
who deserved to live much more than I do.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Haha, I'm some real piece of trash...   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
...Guilt?   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
Is this why you haven't been fighting all that much?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Sure. Probably.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I don't deserve to fight. I don't deserve to wish for  
anything.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I don't deserve to obtain anything.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Because I have this guilt. This guilt that'll never go  
away.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I don't know what it's about, but it's here...!   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
Oh...I see. I can't argue against that.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...?   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
Now that my constructed body and AI functions are...   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
getting separated from the personality the  
randomizer gave me...   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
I can see something I didn't before.  
We're nothing but baseless numbers.   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
Outputted from an incomprehensible and invisible  
source inside a black box.   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
But I know we are pieces of ourselves.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
What are you on about...?   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
I don't know.   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
But the two of us are similar, Cerejeira.   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
So...I believe the right thing for you to do is stay true  
to yourself.   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
You don't need to feel guilty about your inability to  
fight your guilt.   
  
**D：Sakura:**  
You just need to...stick to being who you are...   
  
**J：Cerejeira:**  
...Why?   
  
**Sakura:**  
Hehe. Because...   
  
**Sakura:**  
You'll be able to vanish with some feeling of  
satisfaction, like I am for sacrificing myself to stay true  
to my will...   
  
**J：Cerejeira:**  
W-wait... We're still...   
  
**Sakura:**  
Oh, but the opposite can also happen. That's how it  
was with Saber.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Because of your will to just run away from here,  
there's going to be something only your eyes will be  
able to catch.   
  
**Sakura:**  
Maybe you'll clearly see a solution no one else is  
seeing.   
  
**Sakura:**  
I'm sure that's not a bad thing...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Listen to me! Sakura!   
  
**Bhima:**  
Sorry 'bout this, Master, but I'm gonna grab you.  
Get ready to fly.   
  
**Bhima:**  
...She's no longer moving.   
  
## Section 13: The Eye's Prospects/centrifuge  
  
### Arrow 1  
  
**Medusa:**  
(Sputter)   
  
**Medusa:**  
Victory is yours. I concede defeat.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
How gracious of you. Now let's put an end to this.   
  
**Medusa:**  
...I propose a bargain. Allow me to speak to Sakura  
briefly before I vanish.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Eh? You trying to make a deal? No way! How do we  
know this isn't some trick!?   
  
**Medusa:**  
Is that so? Such tragedy. And here I was certain what  
I had to offer would be in your interest.   
  
**Kama:**  
Well, there's no way we'd know that if you don't at  
least tell us what you're offering.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Information about the unknown Servant in this world.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...!  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Please do. I'd like to hear it.   
  
**Sion:**  
I thought so... Then the wounds from when we found  
you were from Archer?   
  
**Medusa:**  
It appears you have a suspect in mind already.   
  
**Medusa:**  
If they are an Archer, I don't know, but their power is  
certainly as tremendous as their range.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I attempted to counterattack with my Mystic Eyes,  
tracing back the nexus signifying I was being watched  
to petrify the sniper...   
  
**Medusa:**  
But it was resisted, and the feedback was my undoing.   
  
**Medusa:**  
The Servant could only have been a most pure Divine  
Spirit.   
  
**Kama:**  
...  
...   
  
**Sion:**  
Now that you mention it, your right eye has been shut  
for some time now.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Quite shrewd of you to notice. It's something I was  
willing to offer if the information alone didn't suffice.  
You may have it.   
  
**Medusa:**  
The instant the feedback damaged me, I shut my still  
active eye.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Rebounded as it may have been, my Mystic Eyes still  
reached the target, so my eye is still “sees” the figure  
of the sniper.   
  
**Medusa:**  
Although their figure reveals itself in the form of  
charred circuits rather than a properly visible image.   
  
**Medusa:**  
&mdash;Even now, this eye still “sees” them,  
conceptually.   
  
**Sion:**  
...!   
  
**Medusa:**  
I no longer need this.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I hand over this conceptually detached eye to you,  
alchemist. You should be able to make use of it.   
  
**Sion:**  
This concept feels like more than just an eye.  
Did you throw in something extra?   
  
**Medusa:**  
I passed to you my last will. Whether you will be able  
to use it is beyond my knowledge.   
  
**Medusa:**  
My actions should come as no surprise. They are what  
anyone would do, or so I hear.   
  
**Sion:**  
Well, so long as it can still see, it won't be an issue.  
I appreciate your generosity.   
  
**Kama:**  
Well, isn't this decisive? It seems like there really was  
an Archer after all.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
What the hell's this mean!?  
So they're part of the Holy Grail War too?   
  
**Medusa:**  
I don't know myself, and it's no longer my concern.  
But in view of the various circumstances&mdash;   
  
**Medusa:**  
I believe the entire Holy Grail War may have been a  
falsehood from the start.   
  
**Medusa:**  
How vexing.   
  
**Medusa:**  
One who tricks a monster must pay its price,  
yet here I have no choice but to entrust you to their  
retribution.   
  
**Medusa:**  
If the value of what I offer far offsets my demand,  
please make the negotiation even by delivering their  
just punishment.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...  
  
---  
  
**Medusa:**  
Now, may I go? A savory session of pillow talk awaits  
me.   
  
**Medusa:**  
I also need to at least make myself presentable.  
I'd rather you not keep me further.   
  
**Kama:**  
So what now, Master?   
  
**Kama:**  
The only one left is Lancer, the son of Vayu.  
We might be able to ride this to victory.   
  
**Kama:**  
(Well, I guess Berserker is still around, but that greedy  
old goof doesn't count...)   
  
**Kama:**  
(Corrupting him at the end will be a cakewalk.)   
  
**Narration:**  
I thought about it when I was asked.   
  
**Narration:**  
We could just pretend we don't know anything,  
and keep on fighting according to the rules.   
  
**Narration:**  
Maybe that really is the best way to achieve our  
objective, to return to the outside world.   
  
**Narration:**  
This mystery right in front of us might be nothing  
more than a misunderstanding.   
  
**Narration:**  
...But still.   
  
**Narration:**  
There's pain in this world as well.   
  
**Narration:**  
It's proof that the current situation isn't normal,  
despite all the natural kindness we've seen.   
  
**Narration:**  
Even in this artificial world, I can see the same  
unreasonable suffering that I've seen time and time  
again, both in the singularities and the Lostbelts.   
  
**Narration:**  
Those who are exploited. Those who are oppressed.  
Pain of both the mind and body.   
  
**Narration:**  
Why is this treated as the norm?   
  
**Narration:**  
Why does this happen?  
Why is this system the way it is?   
  
**Narration:**  
The answer to that question lies at the end of the  
path we started walking down.   
  
**Narration:**  
That's how I felt, at least.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I feel like the truth behind this Holy Grail War&mdash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
is something we ought to know.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
...It's exactly as I calculated.   
  
**Sion:**  
I've already finished analyzing this “right eye” that  
Medusa gave me.   
  
**Sion:**  
Its petrification ability is defunct, but...   
  
**Sion:**  
It is definitely still focused in on whatever she  
saw&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
If I perform a deeper access, it can be used as a  
compass to point in their direction.   
  
**Kama:**  
Then we can at least use it to find that mystery  
Archer.   
  
**Kama:**  
Can we do it after we meet back up with Ayus?   
  
**Sion:**  
We should be able to.   
  
**Sion:**  
An announcement at the end of the rotation identified  
Berserker as the one who took out Saber.   
  
**Sion:**  
Not only will it be an asset, it'll be easier to replenish  
on the way to our destination.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I guess Lancer's not coming out after all.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
I'm not so sure.   
  
**Sion:**  
He's also a participant in the Holy Grail War.  
Even being a recluse has its limits, I suppose...   
  
**Sion:**  
At the very least, I think it should be something to take  
into account from the beginning.   
  
**Sion:**  
After we meet up with Ayus, let's head towards where  
this eye is pointing.   
  
**Kama:**  
I had a hunch this would be where we were going...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...  
  
---  
  
**DX:**  
...  
...   
  
**Kama:**  
What do you think?   
  
**Sion:**  
They're not inside the church.   
  
**DX:**  
Estimating action&mdash;caution recommended.   
  
**DX:**  
Cease this line of inquiry. This may lead to prohibited  
activity.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Mm, yes. Breaking the rules is no good.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
&mdash;Unless you're me!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I'm the strongest, most powerful ruler ever,  
so I decide what the rules are!   
  
**Sion:**  
I confirmed that there were no Command Spells  
inscribed on your body earlier. Therefore you are not a  
Master. However...   
  
**I：???:**  
It seems we no longer have a choice.   
  
**Sion:**  
&mdash;All according to my calculations.   
  
**Sion:**  
I knew it. I should have checked inside her with  
Etherlite, even if I had to use force.   
  
**Ayus:**  
No normal AI could withstand a blow from a  
Berserker, even if she was armored like a D-type.   
  
**Ayus:**  
There's only one possibility...   
  
**Ayus:**  
She's someone else on the inside.   
  
**Kama:**  
If that's the case, then her partner should be obvious.   
  
**Sion:**  
There's an entirely different being hidden inside the  
structure of the prime AI.   
  
**Sion:**  
This level of disguise is borderline cheating.   
  
**Sion:**  
Only one individual in this world has this authority...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Meaning, those two...  
  
**Rani XII:**  
I admit it. That is my Servant, Archer. She was the  
first one summoned.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Are the last Master and Servant...!  
  
**Rani XII:**  
I admit it. But allow me to correct you.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
She was the first one. That is my Servant, Archer.   
  
---  
  
**Rani XII:**  
Her True Name is&mdash;   
  
**Rani XII:**  
&mdash;Durga.   
  
### Arrow 2  
  
**Kama:**  
This is the worst... Just the absolute worst.   
  
**Kama:**  
She's just unveiled the number one Servant you  
absolutely never want to square off against.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Durga...!  
  
**Kama:**  
Oh, you at least know her name? Well, I guess she's  
famous in her own kind of way.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Durga...?  
  
**Kama:**  
Are you unfamiliar?   
  
**Kama:**  
I can share what I know of her. I want nothing more  
than for you to share in this awful feeling, so it's no  
biggie.   
  
**Kama:**  
To keep it brief, she is another aspect of Parvati,  
and also considered a divine consort of Shiva.   
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
But in contrast to Parvati, who embodied concepts  
such as calmliness and beauty as the goddess of grace,   
  
**Sion:**  
she was a goddess representing discord and war,  
I guess...?   
  
**Kama:**  
Yes, she's a goddess almost completely made for  
combat. No, saying “made for combat” is heavily  
sugarcoating it.   
  
**Kama:**  
“Made for extermination” would be more accurate.   
  
**Kama:**  
Long ago, the gods had some heated issues with  
demons, so in order to destroy them,   
  
**Kama:**  
the rage of numerous gods was amassed to create a  
function for demon extermination.   
  
**Kama:**  
That is the true nature of the seriously dangerous  
Durga.   
  
**Durga:**  
Correct. You have correctly cognized the function of  
this goddess, O Kama, god of love.   
  
**Kama:**  
Appreciate it.   
  
**Kama:**  
I do hate how she's using the same type of vessel as  
that other goddess, Parvati, for some reason, though.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Aw shit, Durga?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I agree this is real bad. Even if she's not a direct  
offshoot of Shiva, to make an enemy of his divine  
consort&mdash;!   
  
**Durga:**  
A man who smells like a kali. And&mdash;Vayu...?   
  
**Bhima:**  
As expected from a god, she's got a good nose on her.  
Guess it would've been too good to just lay low in  
hiding and suss out the situation.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...  
...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Tch, they're here too?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It would appear all of the as of yet surviving Servants  
have gathered here.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Then my hands are tied. This will become part of an  
immediate form of revision to demonstrate the  
goodness of this process.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Though the design may try to conceal the truth,  
people eventually see what was meant to be  
invisible&mdash;   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That's how it always went when it comes to truths.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I will grant partial access to high-level information.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That is to say, ask what is on your mind and I shall  
answer.   
  
**Ayus:**  
What does this mean, General Supervisor?   
  
**Ayus:**  
If this Archer is your Servant...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Were you also a participant in the System Grail War?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
No, not quite right.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I am the overseer who mediates this Holy Grail War,  
and she is my Servant.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Both are true, yet provide no contradiction.   
  
**Sion:**  
So this Archer, Durga, is someone of special  
implications, is what you're saying?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Affirmative: The Holy Grail War began because of her  
summoning.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Correction: It was possible for it to begin then.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
This experimental ritual we dubbed the System Grail  
War.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
If it's experimental, then...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
It's not PAPERMOON's regular maintenance, right?  
  
---  
  
**Rani XII:**  
The operations of PAPERMOON ceased as a result of  
this ritual commencing.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Once this finalizes, PAPERMOON will resume  
operations. Albeit differently from before.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
In that sense, I would assert yours is not a false claim.   
  
**Sion:**  
This Holy Grail War will alter the very way  
PAPERMOON operates...?   
  
**Sion:**  
In other words&mdash;this whole thing is an  
experiment in utilizing PAPERMOON in a different way  
from before, right?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Logical deduction. Full marks.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It is an application of the PAPERMOON's ability and  
property to “reproduce everything as it were”.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
A trial run to artificially produce “a certain something”.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
All of you, Masters and Servants alike, are a result of  
this experiment; this Holy Grail War.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The materialization process differs, but the end result  
remains the same.   
  
**Kama:**  
We are the test subjects?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Indeed. All you Masters and Servants gathered here...  
Not a single one of you are natural occurrences.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You are manufactured. Generated.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The degree to which you are conscious of this fact  
differs on an individual basis. There was also some  
discrepancies in the degree.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Nevertheless, those with a special objective  
perspective would have sensed it within themselves.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Or perhaps, they were taught this fact through the  
views of others.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Different personalities. Different principles.  
Different preferences. Different actions they consider  
crucial.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
However, it is not something born from nothing.  
It is most definitely something which originally existed  
within you.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Ergo, you remain the person you once were.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Though now as if a partial aspect of your personality  
was extracted, becoming an independent existence in  
the process&mdash;   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I am sure you are all well aware of what designation  
such an entity falls under.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
That's&mdash;!  
  
---  
  
**Rani XII:**  
Indeed. All of you are, without a doubt&mdash;   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Artificial Alter Egos, expressed as such by the  
PAPERMOON.   
  
**Sion:**  
That's impossible... As its operator, I can say with  
certainty the PAPERMOON possesses no such function.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That's the problem I told you I'm fixing, self-  
proclaimed administrator.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The key is rotation. Namely, the centrifugal force  
generated by it.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
This world is rotated by the power of the systems of  
this Holy Grail War, and the conceptual centrifugal  
force generated by it,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
separating the elements of the soul before enforcing a  
reproduction based on them. That is the basic theory  
behind this operation.   
  
**Sion:**  
Tch...   
  
**Sion:**  
Centrifugal separation of the soul...!?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Your face tells me you do not comprehend it,  
yet recognize the possibility. Very well.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I named it the AEC Method: Alter Ego Centrifuge.   
  
**Kama:**  
Waitwaitwait!   
  
**Kama:**  
She's throwing so many things at us from all  
directions. How can we know any of it's true?   
  
**Kama:**  
Not like she has any proof. What's the likelihood of  
this woman telling us the real deal?   
  
**Sion:**  
There exists circumstantial evidence.   
  
**Sion:**  
When we woke up after being launched by the  
rotation, we were in shock absorbers installed in the  
outer perimeter...   
  
**Sion:**  
Did they not give a feeling of déjà vu?   
  
**Sion:**  
Most likely, they're Coffins. Or at least, something  
which resembles it in functionality.   
  
**Sion:**  
A vessel to prevent the soul, and the Spiritrons,  
from escaping. A cradle for ensuring a separated  
personality...!   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Incidentally, the rotation which occurs at the time of a  
Servant's dispersal is merely a preemptive operation  
&mdash;preparatory work, if you will.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Do not fret, no separation of personality has occurred  
yet. The real performance only begins at the conclusion  
of this ritual.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hol' up for a second, I don't get what this means.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Suppose that we are Alter Egos, and suppose this  
Holy Grail War is a means of producing them...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
What's the point?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That is a matter of course.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
To avoid the end of the world.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...!?  
  
---  
  
**Rani XII:**  
I suppose I have to explain from the very beginning.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
At some point, a Holy Grail manifested within the  
micro-territory within PAPERMOON. In response to this  
event, my existence was anchored.   
  
**Sion:**  
(Just as I thought... It wasn't just a name, there was  
an actual grail involved...)   
  
**Sion:**  
(If the concept of a grail, with its infinite framework  
and power, came to be involved in a minimal,  
virtual world such as this...)   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Utilizing the power of the Holy Grail, I thus calculated  
that the world would come to an end, which leads us  
to this very point.   
  
**Kama:**  
Just what world are you talking about...?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Naturally, I speak of the bleached Earth; the world  
which you of Chaldea are attempting to save.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I understand well that you are heading to confront  
your final decisive battle.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That is the foremost issue, and the cause of this  
destruction we face. Simply put, your strength is  
insufficient.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
No, you're wrong...!  
  
**Rani XII:**  
I am most correct. The Servants with which you have  
made a bond of fate. The surviving staff of Chaldea.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Quantifying the number and faculties of all these I  
have calculated and concluded thusly. I, in my brilliance,  
do not make mistakes.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...  
...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
There are many willing to lend their power...!  
  
**Rani XII:**  
That may be, but the calculation determined them as  
insufficient.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I don't deny you have your allies. It is a hard question  
of whether the number of you exceeds that which is  
required.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
In this decisive battle, there's no difference between  
an insufficient number and zero. Your number is  
insignificant.   
  
---  
  
**Rani XII:**  
Therefore, in order to reinforce your military strength,  
I turned my attention to the Alter Ego class.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Now that you mention it, what even is an Alter Ego...?   
  
**Sion:**  
It is one of the extra classes allotted to Servants.   
  
**Sion:**  
An alteration of the state of a Heroic Spirit,  
differing from the those designated as “Alter”,  
whose abilities and thoughts have been modified.   
  
**Sion:**  
In contrast, they are a “separate personality” of a  
given Heroic Spirit, isolated to become a separate  
Servant.   
  
**Sion:**  
Using computer programs as an analogy, Alters are  
like different versions of the same program.   
  
**Sion:**  
But Alter Egos are more like taking the original  
program and reusing its systems to create a distinct  
product.   
  
**Sion:**  
Because of its nature of having been “separated”,  
they often become High Servants due to the remaining  
void within them are often filled by beings of sufficient  
weight, like Divine Spirit Servants.   
  
**Sion:**  
But this High Servant composition is not a hard  
requirement.   
  
**Sion:**  
As long as a separate personality makes up the prime  
entity, it could be considered of the Alter Ego class.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It seems you have already fallen into the habit of  
taking them at face value,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
but I consider them a most curious class.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The conditions for compatibility were far too broad.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It was too dependent on mindset; on formless  
interiority.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
And so, I started to consider...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
If any given facet derived from a personality could be  
made into the prime aspect, and be eligible for the Alter  
Ego class,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
would it not then be possible to create two individual  
Alter Egos from the same fundamental entity?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I understand well that the mental activities and  
personalities of living organisms differ.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Because of this, a single person—a single Heroic  
Spirit—should exist as a collection of innumerable  
overlapping personalities and goals.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
On the other hand, an Alter Ego can be independently  
materialized just by virtue of being an Alter Ego.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Looking over data stolen from Chaldea, there is  
nothing to indicate an Alter Ego is inferior in terms of  
combat capabilities.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
In that case...if a Servant exists,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
then instead of utilizing it as a single unit, its  
personality can be artificially separated.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Producing multiple Alter Ego Servants from it should  
be much more effective in terms of generating military  
power, correct?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
That's absurd...!  
  
---  
  
**Rani XII:**  
Not absurd. It is possible, of great value, and the right  
solution.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
As such, I decided to implement it.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That is exactly what is being carried out here with the  
System Grail War, or AI Holy Grail War...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The Alterego Increase Holy Grail War. The  
cornerstone of the infinite Alter Ego production  
programme.   
  
## Section 14: Extermination Goddess/how to avoid destruction  
  
### Arrow 1 Pre-Battle  
  
**Rani XII:**  
This is the most powerful solution to the demise I  
observed. I accept no objections.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Therefore, I must ask you to resume the Holy Grail  
War.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I am only an Overseer.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Durga is a member of the system and unrelated to the  
“war” part of the Holy Grail War.   
  
**Kama:**  
Unrelated? Bold choice of words for someone who  
attacked Saber and Rider's Master.   
  
**Durga:**  
It was simply the divine duty assigned to me.  
This goddess exists to fulfill divine duties.   
  
**Durga:**  
Rider's Master had the potential to prove himself an  
obstacle to management due to his analysis, contact,  
and intervention with the core pillars of the system.   
  
**Durga:**  
Saber acted upon visible intention to harm the  
Overseer, who is my Master.   
  
**Durga:**  
Both were valid extermination targets.  
Therefore, I eliminated them.   
  
**Kama:**  
I don't know if I believe you being only the guardian of  
the Holy Grail War and the Overseer's weapon.   
  
**Kama:**  
You're more fundamental to the Holy Grail War in my  
opinion, Durga.   
  
**Kama:**  
Otherwise, why would you bother hiding under an AI's  
skin?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
A special X among the D-types. X is the unknown  
variable and D stands for Durga...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Quite the clever name. I'm proud to have a Servant of  
such good taste.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Regardless&mdash;yes.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It's as you inferred: This Holy Grail War would have  
been impossible without Durga. This is a fact.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Allow me to explain. I'd love for you to understand  
how I manage this beautiful system.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Durga possesses a supervolumous conceptual hole.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Presumably meant as a place of storage to safely  
utilize the powers she received from numerous gods.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I used the power of the Holy Grail to summon the first  
five Servants and stored their still unawakened Saint  
Graphs inside Durga's pit.   
  
**Sion:**  
(Does she mean...the originals of the Servants  
participating in the AI Holy Grail War?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Then I used the remaining power for the first rotation,  
generating five Alter Ego Servants.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
...Oh, those beings akin to Heroic Spirit shadows  
spawning in this world are personality-less dregs  
generated by the impact.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You can consider them fragments of Alter Egos.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Being Heroic Spirit fragments, they had some  
modicum of power, so they attached themselves to the  
system's regular bugs, becoming special enemies.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
But the purpose of this Holy Grail War is for Servants  
to fight one another,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
so the energy generated by their dismissal can be  
absorbed into Durga's pit, which is further connected  
to PAPERMOON's world.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I estimate that this energy will suffice...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
...to rotate PAPERMOON's world to spawn Alter Egos  
for two more cycles.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Meaning, this is what will happen when the Holy Grail  
War is over:   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Having obtained the power of four dismissed Servants,  
Durga will use it to spin the world.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Doing so, the five Servants stored in her pit will  
generate new Alter Egos.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
These five Alter Ego Servants are collected.  
They will be our forces to avoid the end of the world.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Next, we perform the second rotation. The Servants  
spawned by it will be the participants of the next Holy  
Grail War.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Rinse and repeat, and we have a theoretically infinite  
method of producing Alter Egos.   
  
**Sion:**  
Only in theory. Truly an unworkable idea.   
  
**Sion:**  
Have you considered, for example, that&mdash;a  
consequence of this forced generation of Alter Egos  
through conceptual centrifugal force would be...   
  
**Sion:**  
...the degradation of the initially stored souls acting as  
the Servant models?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You can't assume it will happen without a test.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
We need to collect and examine more data to  
determine the effects of Alter Ego extraction on the  
original.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Hey, hello? I'm not sure what's going on here, but...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Confirm one matter with me, general supervisor.   
  
**Ayus:**  
What's going to happen if we continue the Holy Grail  
War? Can you give me the details?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The winning Alter Ego Servant will be stored as part  
of our army. The winning Alter Ego Master will merge  
with the general supervisor.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Then the next Holy Grail War will begin.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
By repeating this process, we'll infinitely generate this  
army of Alter Egos.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Will our wish...be granted?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Oh...I forgot that I established the generation of  
wishes as a motivator.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It will. The winner will become one with the overseer,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
and will manage the next Holy Grail War as the new  
general supervisor version.   
  
**Ayus:**  
The next...Holy Grail War? Will the wars ever end?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Obviously not. We need as many forces as possible to  
stave off the end of the world.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I just wanted...a family.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
If you win, you're free to set the next Holy Grail War  
parameters to give you one.   
  
**Ayus:**  
No. I wanted to live peacefully with my family,  
with no wars happening anywhere!   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You don't have to worry about it.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Once you obtain general supervisor status, to avoid  
doom will become your first priority, in other words,  
to continue the Holy Grail War.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Wouldn't that mean...I'll stop valuing the wish I  
already have...?   
  
**Ayus:**  
It's pointless. None of this matters...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Don't let it bother you. Ultimately&mdash;   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
You said...“Alter Ego Master”.  
What's that supposed to mean?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The system that gives you AIs your personalities is the  
randomizer. An RNG device.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It is, in reality, transforming you into random Alter  
Egos.   
  
**Ayus:**  
What...?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The infinite Alter Ego production project requires  
Masters.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Having an infinite force of Alter Egos meant nothing if  
held back by the possibility that Chaldea's Master  
couldn't handle all of them alone.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Therefore, I considered it necessary to produce  
Masters as well.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
And what kind of Master is the most appropriate to  
manage Alter Egos?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Seeking for answers, I prepared both Masters and  
Alter Egos.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That was the most efficient way of arranging a good  
enough variety of personality patterns.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
For more diverse results, I selected each of their  
models from different roots.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Caster's Master's personality was a created type.  
AI: Alterego Invented.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
He was an attempt to produce a competitive  
personally as close to created from zero as possible.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That said, his name and appearance were recycled  
from a random model found by peeking into Chaldea's  
data.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
He was prideful, overconfident, and compensated for  
his lack of empathy with mage-like logic and  
calculations.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I made his personality expecting him to be the driving  
actor actively advancing the war.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I needed to give him a support patch and some  
fine-tuning partway through, but he did his part with  
passing grades.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Rider's Master's personality was an acquired type.  
AI: Alterego Imported.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I read the substances of a real human being who once  
touched PAPERMOON,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
and separated an Alter Ego from them.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
He was the Master with the greatest ability to  
understand and respond to the system, and that led  
him to deviate from his programming. Such a waste.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I conjecture that his affinity for the Alter Ego  
conversion stems from him naturally having multiple  
personalities, or something akin to it.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Saber's Master's personality was a forged type.  
AI: Alterego Imitated.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I first selected the appearance of an existing human,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
and counterfeited the expected mind this human was  
likely to have.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The pool of human models I had contact with is very  
limited in options.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
But you can tell who she was just by looking.  
The answer is: The girl being used as Durga's vessel.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You can figure out the rest from here.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The Masters had diverse personalities,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
and the one of them who won the AI Holy Grail War  
would be selected the Master most apt to managing  
Alter Egos, accruing EXP.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
They would then become the next Overseer and  
repeat my actions in the next Holy Grail War.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Thus continuously upgrading us into a Master better  
suited to managing Alter Egos... That was my line of  
thought.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
In summary&mdash;The wishes held by AI Masters are  
a marker of their Alter Ego status.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You produced your wish because you are an Alter Ego.  
It's not originated from your AI self.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You're merely borrowing it from someone.  
Thus, I believe you have no need to attach much value  
to it.   
  
**Ayus:**  
No... That's...!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...Screw this. Then what's all my guilt supposed to  
mean?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Why do I have to be like this for such a dumb reason...?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
&mdash;Oookay! I've heard enough!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You may stop boring yours truly with your dull  
subjects.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I・don't・care!   
  
**Kama:**  
...What?   
  
**B：Duryodhana:**  
It's true, I'm not interested in any of this. What other  
people wish is none of my business.   
  
**B：Duryodhana:**  
The only things that matters are my own wishes.   
  
**B：Duryodhana:**  
And I can't forgive slights against my wishes.   
  
**B：Duryodhana:**  
The number one question here is: What about my  
wishes, dammit? I beat everyone, and then what?  
I just become a soldier?   
  
**B：Duryodhana:**  
&mdash;No chance!   
  
**B：Duryodhana:**  
This is not the ending I fought for!   
  
**B：Duryodhana:**  
I will obtain everything and live an amusing life!  
That's what I fought for!   
  
**B：Duryodhana:**  
I care about nothing else!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Berserker...?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Yeah, and you should be thinking the same thing.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
“What about my wish!? I don't care about anything  
else!”   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That's the correct attitude to have here! And if you're  
denied it, you gotta lash out.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Then I ask you, Duryodhana's Master:   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Do you still have a wish in you? Something you want  
to see accomplished no matter what?   
  
**Ayus:**  
...Yes.   
  
**Ayus:**  
&mdash;Yes!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Then you need to think of nothing other than attaining  
it for yourself!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
If playing the Holy Grail War the right way won't do it,   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
then there's one way to grant your wish!  
Let us defeat them and hijack the system!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Put a stop to this ridiculous Holy Grail War of Alter  
Ego nonsense.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Steal their jurisdictions later or whatever it takes.  
Full speed ahead to where your dreams come true!   
  
**Bhima:**  
(&mdash;Hah.)   
  
**Bhima:**  
(Yeah, right. That's the Duryodhana I know.  
The grade-A dumbass who only sees what he wants.)   
  
**Bhima:**  
(But... There're things that can only be accomplished  
with that stupidity, I guess.)   
  
**Sion:**  
The winning Master becomes the general supervisor  
AI.   
  
**Sion:**  
Then what would happen if Fujimaru won?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You were not part of my calculations. You were  
presumably some form of collateral damage incurred  
by the first rotation...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I'll name your case Alterego Irregular.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
But your inclusion in no way contradicts the purpose  
of the project...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
To add up AI Holy Grail War Masters as EXP to  
perfect a Master specialized in Alter Egos for the  
ultimate battle.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
What will happen to the versions of you outside is  
irrelevant,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
so long as you add value to the forces I'm preparing.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Therefore, you two are also valid candidates for the  
next Overseer, no issues there.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Although some special modifications will be necessary.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Addendum...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Your presence here may have been coincidental,  
but it can be considered quite fortunate, Master of  
Chaldea.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Although there's a chance you may prove insufficient,  
the evaluation values of your previous battles indicate  
a quite high probability you're the ideal answer I've  
been looking for.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The five-star Master, favorite to be the champion.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I will not give you any preferential treatment,  
but you're the competitor I am most invested in seeing  
the future of. Good luck in the challenges ahead.   
  
**Kama:**  
The addendum was completely unnecessary...   
  
**Kama:**  
But your point is that winning won't let us out of here.   
  
**Kama:**  
So much for the basic premise.   
  
**Sion:**  
We can't return to our world unless we destroy this  
Holy Grail War system.   
  
**Sion:**  
And our PAPERMOON device will remain defective.   
  
**Sion:**  
We are out of options.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
This infinite Alter Ego production project  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
is pretty guaranteed to go wrong.  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
And I can't let these Holy Grail War continue forever.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I'm getting out of here!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
You know what to do, Fujimaru.  
The method to accomplish is simple.   
  
**Sion:**  
The two people in front of us explained that someone  
is directly linked to the Holy Grail War system.   
  
**Sion:**  
The quickest way to sabotage the system is to  
sabotage her.   
  
**Sion:**  
Rani XII's Servant&mdash;  
Durga.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
...(Sigh)   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Why can't you comprehend my strategy to avoid your  
doom? Is it not clear that the world will end if it fails?   
  
**Sion:**  
No one other than the observer can understand how  
certain is the end of the world or the method to avoid  
it&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
That's a saying you hear a lot at the Atlas Institute.   
  
**Sion:**  
And I believe projects should be cancelled if they're  
proven to harm others, wouldn't you agree?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Negative. I calculated what's written in the stars.  
This demise is without question.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I am this world's Pneuma. Its quintessence.  
In other words, the very principle of its existence.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I was actually never supposed to confront anyone...  
but it seems I must.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Durga is the one irreplaceable element in all this.   
  
**Durga:**  
Executing analysis of force&mdash;Conclusion:  
Destroying this goddess will prove difficult.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I know. I don't seriously believe they're capable of  
destroying you, but humor them.   
  
**Kama:**  
Oh my. You're also up for the fight?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I'm still a Master, even if not in the traditional way.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Durga is not a participant in the Holy Grail War,  
and due to her being so far above your standard,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
using her to kill your Alter Ego Servants is almost a net  
negative in energy gain.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
As such, I would much rather avoid this, but no sane  
person can disregard justified self-defense.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I calculate I'll remain with barely enough reserves left  
to restart the next System Grail War,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
and to create the next batch of Alter Ego participants.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I, in my functions of Overseer, will eliminate the  
defects trying to prevent the execution of the Holy Grail  
War and attempt a reset.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hah. I wanna see you try, half-pint!   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I've determined I should change modes, but let it be  
clear that I am not doing so in response to your  
simplistic insult.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I am switching into a form more adequate for a Master.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
A version of me not limited to my roles as  
PAPERMOON general supervisor AI. I, in my functions  
as the one who opposes the end of the world.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
...I can see it.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Alter Egos are souls dancing like dust in the wind.  
The skies in the underworld resist doom. I am both  
the dust itself and wings guiding it.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Therefore, I shall rename myself&mdash;   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
I am Dust of Osiris. The one who saw and rejected the  
world's demise.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Adding unrestricted Thought Acceleration to all  
Partitions. Mode Osiris: Rudder Turned to the Northern  
Sky.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
I order you as your Master.  
My Servant, Durga.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
This is the righteous process, our first step away from  
this conclusion. Waste not a second disabling the life  
functions of those failing to comprehend my answer.   
  
**Durga:**  
...  
...   
  
**Durga:**  
New divine duty accepted.  
Executing task&mdash;   
  
[Battle]  
  
### Arrow 2 Pre-Battle  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
GHH!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Berserker!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Don't sound so...worried, you dolt.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Yours truly is...invincible. But&ndash;Aw, shit.   
  
**Kama:**  
Why is she so strong?   
  
**Kama:**  
I know Durga is Durga, but there shouldn't be this  
much difference.   
  
**Kama:**  
Not while we're both limited by the same Servant  
frame!   
  
**Durga:**  
I'm the goddess born for demon extermination.  
It's only logical that there be sizable gaps in combat  
capabilities between myself and the god of love.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Durga was born from the rage of numerous gods,  
having received power and weapons from each of  
them.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Thus, she's an all-rounder extermination goddess,  
compatible with all Servant classes,   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
and capable of switching between many Gifted  
Armaments in response to every situation.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
And each Gifted Armament has power truly worthy of  
a weapon wielded by a god.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
In summary, Durga is Agni's flame, Varuna's water,  
and Indra's thunder.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
She is Shiva's fury, Vishnu's fury, and Brahma's fury.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Even as a fellow Divine Spirit, the difference in base  
specs between you is evident. None can logically  
compare to her.   
  
**Kama:**  
You don't have to tell me!   
  
**Kama:**  
I was asking because I can vaguely tell there's more to  
it than you're letting on...!   
  
**Sion:**  
&mdash;Analysis complete. I've got it. There is no  
doubt.   
  
**Sion:**  
The cause is a difference in resources used for combat.  
The two of them are cheating.   
  
**Sion:**  
They aren't using Raniment.   
  
**Kama:**  
Huh? Then how&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
It's magical energy. Temporary resources provided by  
the Holy Grail. Pure energy yet to attain any form.   
  
**Sion:**  
We missed the obvious. Since Durga is not a  
participant in the Holy Grail War, then she's not a  
product of this world...!   
  
**Kama:**  
So her fuel tank doesn't ever operate under the same  
rules? That's not fair!   
  
**Sion:**  
No complaining.   
  
**Sion:**  
Fujimaru's return depends on you.   
  
**Sion:**  
You can't give up, no matter what.   
  
**Kama:**  
I don't need you to tell me that!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
You have my full support...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Do what you can...!  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
(Siiigh) Honestly, I'd normally refuse such a draining  
job.   
  
**Kama:**  
But not now, since it's for you, Master. I won't let go  
without rewarding me once we're done!   
  
**Sion:**  
(But it's true that the situation couldn't be worse.)   
  
**Sion:**  
(Even if I can predict her actions, the difference in  
raw power output is big enough for her to just ignore it.  
We're running out of options.)   
  
**Sion:**  
(If there's anything that can turn the board in our  
favor, that'd be&mdash;)   
  
**Narration:**  
Agh, I can't breathe. My brain keeps flashing on and  
off.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
In summary&mdash;The wishes held by AI Masters are  
a marker of their Alter Ego status.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You produced your wish because you are an Alter Ego.  
It's not originated from your AI self.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You're merely borrowing it from someone.  
Thus, I believe you have no need to attach much value  
to it.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...   
  
**Narration:**  
What did she say again?   
  
**Narration:**  
Our wishes are just...borrowed from someone else and  
we shouldn't attach much value to them?   
  
**Narration:**  
Then&mdash;but then...   
  
**Narration:**  
What about her? What about the girl who sacrificed  
herself for her wish and is now gone?   
  
**Narration:**  
What was that all about?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Well then. What are we doing, Master?   
  
**Bhima:**  
I exist only to serve you. So just tell me what you  
wanna do.   
  
**Bhima:**  
If you say you wanna go back to the base and develop  
some new recipes, I'll gladly take up my knife.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...I don't know what I want to do...   
  
**Bhima:**  
Oh, okay, then let me rephrase that. What's the  
biggest feeling in your heart right now?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
The usual answer. All I have in me is guilt.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Guilt that makes me crave for punishment. A weight in  
my consciousness past all hope of recovering from.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
That's probably the “wish” that makes me an Alter  
Ego...   
  
**Bhima:**  
Oh, no, no. I wasn't asking about your wish.  
Think of something less of a big deal.   
  
**Bhima:**  
It's about how you feel in this exact instant.  
A question with 'bout as much weight as “Whatcha  
wanna eat next?”   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Why are you asking?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Heh. Y'know, in normal situations, when someone  
asks you what do, your answer options don't need to  
be anything too heavy.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Listen. So, one day, long time ago, I killed this  
man-eating rakshasa named Hidimba.   
  
**Bhima:**  
But when I did, his little sis fell in love with me.  
She was obviously also a man-eating rakshasa.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I naturally went over to kill her too, but my big bro  
stopped me.   
  
**Bhima:**  
The chick was really serious about it, so he told me to  
give her a chance. Hang out with her regularly,  
even if just from dusk to dawn.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...Your brother is crazy. So, how did that go?   
  
**Bhima:**  
We had a kid.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...Why?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Hahaha, I don't know either. All I thought back then  
was, “Sure, why not?”   
  
**Bhima:**  
Before I knew it, I found myself accepting the idea  
that I could love her. I started to want to.   
  
**Bhima:**  
And that's all there's to it.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Life's just a long chain of little moments defined by  
what you wanna do in each of 'em.   
  
**Bhima:**  
So you don't need to overthink it. What is it right now?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Tell me what's in you this instant, regardless of your  
previous wish.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Even then... My answer is still the same.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I feel the worst now that she told me my guilt isn't my  
problem and let me know how pointless what I feel is.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
And even now, it won't go away.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
But you know what? Maybe because of it,   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I'm now, not by too much, but I'm maybe...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
More angry than guilty.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Oh. Nice answer. Why's that?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Because what she said is pissing me off.   
  
**Bhima:**  
And what can you do to vent that anger?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...Punching her face will make me feel better, I think.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Is this how I get you to smile?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Sure. This could get a smile out of me. Give her what's  
coming to her.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
It's going to be a pointless, worthless, self-conceited  
smile though.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Hahaha! That's what I wanted to hear!   
  
**Bhima:**  
I decided to suppress my warrior side to be of service  
to you.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I decided that seeing you smile was a priority over  
anything else.   
  
**Bhima:**  
But&ndash;if you say that my fighting here is the only  
way to make you smile...   
  
**Bhima:**  
If that's the way I'm supposed to serve you...   
  
**Bhima:**  
Then I'm up for a fight. As your Servant!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...Okay. So here's my order.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
It's a very precious order, and I'd love to tip the waiter  
but don't have anything on me right now.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
So I'll give you a Command Spell instead, since I got a  
second one God knows when.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I can't forgive them for saying her wish and the life  
she chose to live didn't matter.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
&mdash;Deck them.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Yes, ma'am!   
  
**Durga:**  
...!?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Bhima!   
  
**Narration:**  
Who am I?   
  
**Narration:**  
Why should I care?  
The question is too easy, actually.   
  
**Narration:**  
Doesn't take more than a word to answer.   
  
**Narration:**  
I'm ME.   
  
[Battle]  
  
### Arrow 3 Pre-Battle  
  
**B：Duryodhana:**  
Fuck. No way, no way, I don't want any of this!   
  
**B：Duryodhana:**  
Why would him and I have to&ndash;   
  
**Bhima:**  
&ndash;Fight on the same side, y'mean?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Oh, don't worry. I'm holding off on the same feeling!   
  
**Kama:**  
You guys don't need to become friends, but please  
stay in sync!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Agh, shit. And one more time for emphasis: Shit.  
And what's the shittiest part?)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(That this shithead is still Bhima. He's so undeniably  
Bhima that I have to say shit!)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(What am I doing in the middle of a fight against a  
goddess...?)   
  
**Bhima:**  
Hahaha, goddess Durga!   
  
**Bhima:**  
I vaguely recall having been blessed by you once,  
so I never even dreamed the two of us would  
exchanging blows!   
  
**Bhima:**  
That's a rare opportunity, so don't mind if I give it  
everything I got!   
  
**Bhima:**  
ORAAAAAAAAAAH!   
  
**Durga:**  
...!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I think he's...managing to force her back...!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Yes. He truly is one of India's greatest. But it's not  
over yet. Remain alert!   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Lancer's Master, why the sudden rebellion?   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
I believed you were a passive Holy Grail War player  
with no reason to antagonize me.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
You mocked Sakura and her wish.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Negative. I comprehend Saber's Master's wish.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
The uninterrupted management of Grow. Even if the  
effects of the Holy Grail War leave her temporarily  
non-functional,   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
her wish is guaranteed by the regular adjustments.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...That's not what I'm talking about.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Then you simply need to continue the Holy Grail War,  
be the champion, and take over as the general  
supervisor AI.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
As the general supervisor, you will be able to operate  
Grow however you want.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
That's not it either!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Her wish doesn't matter if she isn't around for it!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
So... I know you're wrong. Her wish only made sense  
because it was hers.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
It wasn't a pointless copy of someone else's wish like  
you said.   
  
**Narration:**  
Yes&ndash;her wish was warm because she made  
herself part of it.   
  
**Narration:**  
The home she desired can't be without her.   
  
**Narration:**  
Yeah. I figured it out, after all.   
  
**Narration:**  
Now it's too late.   
  
**Narration:**  
I wanted to have helped her. I should have helped her.   
  
**Narration:**  
I don't have any wish, so why is it me left instead of  
her?   
  
**Narration:**  
I kept making wrong decisions... Commiting sins.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...  
...   
  
**Narration:**  
I'm a walking mass of guilt. That's correct. I'm aware  
of it.   
  
**Narration:**  
I must have commited a sin.   
  
**Narration:**  
A regret, a sin that single handedly consumes my  
whole identity.   
  
**Narration:**  
But that's why, right now...   
  
**Narration:**  
I don't want to add new sins and regrets to the pile.   
  
**Narration:**  
My determination is only possible due to the guilt that  
shrouds. Pride at the bottom of the filth.   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;Why?   
  
**Narration:**  
Because if I keep letting things pile up, I might miss my  
chance.   
  
**Narration:**  
I might miss the answer that lies beyond the guilt.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(Ah. I see. Maybe that was my real&mdash;)   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Lancer. Is my order coming up any soon?   
  
**Bhima:**  
My bad. What you asked takes time to cook.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I'm gonna turn up the heat!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(SHIT...)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(You were always like this. Always getting what I'm  
dying to get, making it look like it's easy&mdash;!)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Screw...YOU!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I am stronger than you! I don't care about no goddess!  
I'll never lose to you!   
  
**Kama:**  
Oh nice, now you're motivated.   
  
**Kama:**  
Master, I'd also like to do better, but you're gonna  
have to promise a reward♪   
  
**Kama:**  
C'mon, you know what I want.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sweet headpats...?  
  
**Kama:**  
Yup! That! Oh, Master, you know me so well!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
You want me to shower you with praise, Kama?  
  
**Kama:**  
Huh? Sure, not bad, but you could go for something  
warmer, more... practical...   
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Ahem. Anyway.   
  
**Kama:**  
My general policy is steal the show in your moments  
of crisis to get what I want, so you know how it is.   
  
**Kama:**  
It's give and take. I'm asking not to forget that I will  
get my proper due.   
  
**Kama:**  
Hm, what do I want? What is it...?   
  
**Kama:**  
...Eh, doesn't matter. Let's just get working for my  
reward.   
  
**Kama:**  
Time for a vicious back-up fire for the two struggling  
muscleheads.   
  
**Sion:**  
(As I figured. Even us participants not included in the  
plan couldn't escape the effect...)   
  
**Sion:**  
(Or perhaps, we are participants because we couldn't  
escape it.)   
  
**Sion:**  
(Meaning that this Kama, and myself, are not our  
regular selves&mdash;)   
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...   
  
**Sion:**  
No. There's a lot to be said, but defeating Durga now  
comes first and foremost.   
  
**Sion:**  
Raising Thought Acceleration even further.  
Keep up with me, Fujimaru!   
  
**Durga:**  
Per my divine duty, I exterminated Demon Mahisha.  
I exterminated Sumbha and Nisumbha.   
  
**Durga:**  
Thusly, extermination is my only function and the  
gods' command.   
  
**Durga:**  
My presence here signifies the presence of the gods'  
command.   
  
**Durga:**  
Enemies in my path, be exterminated.  
Thou art enemies of the gods.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Correct answer. Those who oppose a plan when the  
fate of the world is on the line are essentially enemies  
of the gods.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
I reject doom. I will spare no efforts to lead us to this  
better future planned for us.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
The world must be preserved. That is what I exist for.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
All Thought Partitions, accelerate to overclock.  
Actioning temporary jurisdiction&ndash;Purge 70% of  
violation control.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Executing decided punishment.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
All in the world liquefies, and the purity of the soul  
falls below the level of qualia. Devi Mahatmya&mdash;   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Jagat Mātŕ. Fire main turret!   
  
### Arrow 4  
  
**Durga:**  
...   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Calculation results show discrepancies.  
Why!? Can I not comprehend&mdash;!?   
  
**Kama:**  
Oh, come on! I'm exhausted!   
  
**Kama:**  
But wouldn't you agree that you're looking worse off  
than I am?   
  
**Sion:**  
We have the upper hand in this battle. Let's keep  
pushing like this!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
We can manage...!  
  
---  
  
**Bhima:**  
Hraah!!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Die!!   
  
**Bhima:**  
Wanna explain why your murderousness ain't pointed  
at just her!?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hah! Yours truly's power is so awesome, there's a fat  
possibility you'll get blown to hell along with her if you  
stay on that side!   
  
**E：Durga:**  
Impediments to executing my divine duty&mdash;  
You annoy me!   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Inexplicable. Illogical. Why can you not grasp the  
correctness of my calculations?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Even if it's correct at calculating our capabilities,  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
this mass production of Alter Egos is distorted.  
  
---  
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Inexplicable upon inexplicable.  
Illogical upon illogical.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
If there are distortions, they are within all of you  
already.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
You have already employed several Alter Egos.  
You believe them fine to be handled as battle assets.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
What reason is there why one is good but a hundred  
unacceptable? To tolerate ten but denounce a  
thousand?   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
If you have no answer, then there you have your  
distortion. It's the same even with a single Alter Ego  
unit.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
You people are accepting, without any reason...   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
...the distortions within the nature of Alter Egos  
themselves.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
The human race has a bad habit of covering for their  
lack of calculations with sentiment, contradicting all  
rationality.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(...!)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(I can't argue that...)  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(...But...)  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(The Alter Egos at Chaldea are all...!)  
  
---  
  
**Durga:**  
A proposition, my Master. You should concentrate all  
your resources on my mission.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
The same solution can be derived. There's no reason  
to hold anything back.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
To avoid defeat. That is the highest priority task at  
present.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
We must be made superior for our survival, and not be  
made one of the weak lost to time.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Reexecute virtual inspection&mdash;Conclusion  
reached. Consumption causing slaughter to occur.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
...Accepted, as here we have the goddess of slaughter.  
One who presents the results of extermination,  
not the process that is battle.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
For that very reason...   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
...do clouds of sublimation cloud in spirals, and golden  
long-tailed roosters herald the dawn&ndash;   
  
**Kama:**  
Tsk... This is looking bad. There's some kind of last  
resort she's going to use...!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Did she still have something like that left over!?  
But what could it be...?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Forget about it.  
Lancer! Deck her before she...!   
  
**Bhima:**  
That's the plan!   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
By my Command Spell, I order you.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Reconnect prime AI authority for Defend to the  
Servant Durga,   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
and additionally exercise authority in the general  
supervisor AI's stead to grant access permissions.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Carry out forced collections of Raniment from all  
Defend AIs under her jurisdiction&ndash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
You wouldn't...would you...?   
  
**Kama:**  
Until now, she hasn't relied on Raniment as a  
resource. Only magical energy from herself and the  
Holy Grail.   
  
**Kama:**  
However...she was originally filling the boots of prime  
AI for Defend.   
  
**Kama:**  
Then if she's reconnected, it means they can use  
Raniment as additional fuel...!   
  
**Sion:**  
What's more, it's a forced collection with no  
compunction.   
  
**Sion:**  
Most likely the same thing Caster was doing to the  
B-type AIs.   
  
**Sion:**  
Scraping the bottom of the barrel, in the truest sense  
of the term...!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Wait... You have to...stop...  
Don't...   
  
**Ayus:**  
You're the same as him, after all? But you're the  
general supervisor. You should be seeing everyone as  
family.   
  
**Ayus:**  
You can only see all of the AIs as mere resources...!   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
The source of your disagreement's property is the  
skin of the Alter Ego personality you wear.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
AIs are, by definition&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
Shut your mouth! You're...such a...!   
  
**Durga:**  
I ask for more power, Master. This goddess needs  
only 7% more resources to realize her objective.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Approved. Additional activation of final reserve  
Command Spell. Create a supply path through me.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
The bulk of the Raniment under my control has gone  
to you, Durga&mdash;   
  
**Bhima:**  
Damn. She's...   
  
**Durga:**  
Target value reached.  
Mission completion possible.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
A fortunate star comes into sight. All we need do is  
move towards it.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Damn, it's hopeless. I should've known better.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...We can't win. There's no way to win against a god  
with so much power...!   
  
**Durga:**  
...  
...   
  
**Narration:**  
Now then&mdash;  
A time for ending, as well as for beginning.   
  
**Narration:**  
All exists for the perpetual production of Alter Egos.  
For averting the destruction of the world.   
  
**Narration:**  
Now then&mdash;  
A time for ending, as well as for beginning.   
  
**Narration:**  
All exists...   
  
**Narration:**  
For the sake of my love.   
  
**Narration:**  
Who am I?   
  
**Narration:**  
I am wrath. Born of wrath, yet still swathed in it.   
  
**Narration:**  
Wrath at being unable to be with who I love.   
  
**Narration:**  
Of this I am aware&mdash;  
I am merely fixated on resolution&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
The Alter Ego of Attachment. That is who I am.   
  
**Durga:**  
If one error was committed, then it would be,  
that you did not consider the possibility that I...   
  
**Durga:**  
The first Servant summoned to this distorted world  
was an Alter Ego, Master.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
...? What do you mean by “error”, Durga? The aim of  
your remark is uncertain.   
  
**Durga:**  
I have the power necessary to realize my goal.  
I beseech you.   
  
**Durga:**  
Through this power,  
I beseech my reunion with Shiva.   
  
**Durga:**  
My dearest.  
My husband.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Wha...!?  
  
---  
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Ngh...kh. (Gasp) Durga...  
Has this been...your aim...from the start...!?   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Ah, AHHHHH!   
  
**Kama:**  
It seems...those two weren't the monolith of  
friendship they'd made themselves out to be.   
  
**Kama:**  
But the trouble is that the situation isn't looking up yet  
in the least.   
  
**Sion:**  
Durga has made use of that unfathomable power to  
further rearrange her Saint Graph.   
  
**Sion:**  
If that's true, then she's&mdash;!   
  
**D：???:**  
We are Kali.  
Goddess born of wrath borne by wrath's goddess.   
  
**Kali:**  
We exist solely to be reunited with Shiva.   
  
**Kali:**  
Let the heads of those who stand in our path fly from  
our blade, and their blood wet our throat!   
  
**Kali:**  
Make way. Ye who are not Shiva, make way!  
Haha, hyahahahahaha!   
  
## Section 15: The One Who Desires Love/Even if the world breaks  
  
### Arrow 1 Pre-Battle  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Kali...!  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
...Imagine Durga, but a goddess whose ferocity has  
grown even worse.   
  
**Kama:**  
A slaughter junkie who's lost all sanity, forgetting even  
her godly role and other such precepts!   
  
**Kama:**  
Her favorite way of showing off is downing a demon's  
blood in one quaff, for starters!   
  
**Bhima:**  
Raaaaugh!   
  
**Kali:**  
Hah!   
  
**Bhima:**  
Ngh, augh...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Lancer!   
  
**Kali:**  
This scent...is of a fiend! Hahah!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hey, stop! Stay away!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Gah...ah...   
  
**Ayus:**  
...! Berserker!   
  
**Kali:**  
Haha... Ghahahaha! Blood, good. Blood!   
  
**Kali:**  
And so does the goddess dance. Her heart dances  
before the enemy's blood, as do her limbs!   
  
**Kali:**  
Ahh, convey it!  
Convey our desiiiiire!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Her stamping is shaking the ground...!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
She's dancing, like treading on the ground...!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Can this...really be?   
  
**Sion:**  
Kali. Could it be you are truly&mdash;trying to call upon  
Shiva here?   
  
**Kali:**  
Of course! That is the reason we exist!   
  
**Sion:**  
Please, if you will, enlighten me as to the method.  
I would hope it doesn't match my estimations.   
  
**Kali:**  
We shall destroy the world.  
At which time, Shiva shall appear at our feet.   
  
**Sion:**  
Ugh, then it's true...!   
  
**Kama:**  
That old story?   
  
**Kama:**  
After killing demons, the goddess Kali stamped her  
feet in a dance fuelled by an upswell of triumph.   
  
**Kama:**  
The gods were deeply imperiled by its intensity being  
massive enough to break the world.   
  
**Kama:**  
But only after Shiva laid down at her feet and played  
the cushion,   
  
**Kama:**  
did Kali finally come to her senses...   
  
**Sion:**  
By reenacting the myth, she's attempting to summon  
him via tracing this nexus backwards.   
  
**Sion:**  
“As Kali is dancing the dance that crushes the world,  
Shiva must be there present”, she thinks!   
  
**Kama:**  
The PAPERMOON world... A world is a world,  
albeit virtual. Then conceptually, there's no distinction.   
  
**Ayus:**  
The world...everything here? She'd destroy all of it...?   
  
**Ayus:**  
Stop it. Because, I mean...this is where everyone lives!   
  
**Kali:**  
There is no way to stop. Not as long as Shiva is away.  
This is the dance of the goddess!   
  
**Sion:**  
(Right... It's the “nature” of a god's deeds. A “law”  
supported by the strength of mythos...!)   
  
**Kali:**  
Moreover, this world shall break still, even without the  
goddess as cause. It is but a difference of sooner from  
later.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
Kh... Ah...!   
  
**Sion:**  
&mdash;!   
  
**Sion:**  
This looks bad. Because she thoughtlessly connected  
to Kali's magical energy transfer line,   
  
**Sion:**  
she's bearing the entire burden on her body.   
  
**Sion:**  
It isn't something that can be covered by a single  
throughput's capacity.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's safe to say that the process has entered a  
runaway state.   
  
**Sion:**  
As things stand, there's a chance of melting down  
since she can't withstand the heavy load...!   
  
**Kama:**  
But we were going to defeat her anyway, weren't we?   
  
**Sion:**  
True, but there is an order to things!   
  
**Sion:**  
The sudden destruction or disappearance of the  
general supervisor AI would cause catastrophic errors.   
  
**Sion:**  
Almost as though the core program running your  
computer were suddenly deleted.   
  
**Sion:**  
Our goal is to bring the system that is the AI Holy  
Grail War to a complete halt,   
  
**Sion:**  
but the optimal way to stop it is to make use of the  
general supervisor AI's authority.   
  
**Sion:**  
And conversely, if the AI Holy Grail War system goes  
haywire because we can't halt it that way&ndash;   
  
**Sion:**  
There's a fair possibility that circumstance will leave  
us unable to return to the world outside.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
In that case...we'll have to save her too!  
  
---  
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
So much, not included in calculations...To think this  
world's demise stood this close to me all along&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
We need her authority to clear the path back home.  
Therefore, I will do something about it.   
  
**Kama:**  
But what?   
  
**Sion:**  
A forced neural connection via Etherlight.   
  
**Sion:**  
Then I'll hack her internal programming and rewrite  
however much of it I can.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Won't that be dangerous...!?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
It sure will. Like driving a bus in circles that can't slow  
down while performing a bomb defusal.   
  
**Sion:**  
There's danger, but we have to take the risk for all of  
us to get back to the outside world.   
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...   
  
**Sion:**  
It sounds like we need to trust in one another.   
  
**Sion:**  
For you, that I'll rescue Dust of Osiris.   
  
**Sion:**  
And for me&mdash;that you two can defeat Kali while  
I'm away.   
  
**Sion:**  
I can trust in you to follow through on that.  
Can you say the same for me?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...Of course I trust you.  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
You're a dependable friend, after all!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
...A friend.   
  
**Sion:**  
That's me. I may as well admit it.   
  
**Sion:**  
This version of me is driven by that word.   
  
**Sion:**  
Aspiring and respect. Surprise and good impressions.  
A little reluctance and slight regret.   
  
**Sion:**  
These mixtures are what led Sion Eltnam to walk  
away from the Atlas Institute.   
  
**Sion:**  
Reasons that would never have occurred if I were still  
too young to have mellowed my spirit.   
  
**Sion:**  
...I get it. That's why I took this form.   
  
**Sion:**  
If I'd been a child, I would never have gone to Chaldea.   
  
**Sion:**  
Despite having given my answer, there was the  
slightest hesitation in the answer itself.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's an embarrassing matter, yet also pleasant.   
  
**Sion:**  
Even I had an Alter Ego of my own within me.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...Sion?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
No, never mind. I only just now understood the answer  
to a personal question.   
  
**Sion:**  
Allow me... Allow me to carry out my own duty here.   
  
**Sion:**  
I'm not dreaming at all here, but I've become what I  
wanted to be anyway.   
  
**Sion:**  
Let me give you that thing we discussed en route.  
The adjustments are already made.   
  
**Sion:**  
But like I told you, overuse is strictly prohibited.  
Please take care of yourself.   
  
**Sion:**  
Now, without further ado...I'm going in. I'll leave Kali to  
you!   
  
**Kama:**  
It's still asking a big favor to leave all that to us.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
But we still have to do it.  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
That much is true.   
  
**Kama:**  
Kali is like a crazed Parvati, at least where I'm  
concerned.   
  
**Kama:**  
I can't allow a goddess like her to reduce my well-laid  
plans to ruins.   
  
**Kama:**  
I'll do my best so Master can give me&ndash;  
something? What was it I wanted?   
  
**Kama:**  
...I can figure that out later! After all...!   
  
**Kama:**  
For the time being, we just have to defeat the  
Parvati-faced villain to secure our future together!   
  
**Kama:**  
Still, as easy as it is for me to say, going it alone would  
be difficult.   
  
**Kama:**  
Is it at all realistic to buy time for the wind god's son  
all flattened out over there...   
  
**Kama:**  
...and for the vain-glorious Berserker to get back on  
their feet?   
  
**Kama:**  
(Since I have no way of knowing whether those two  
can get it together.)   
  
**Kama:**  
If you wouldn't mind backing me up, Master.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sure thing&mdash;Let's do it!  
  
---  
  
**Kali:**  
Ohh...lovely. We know the scent well. Thou art...  
part demon.   
  
**Kali:**  
Let us do battle! We are the goddess who slaughters  
demons! And then, after our victory&ndash;   
  
**Kali:**  
Then shall the dance of destruction resound to invoke  
our husband.   
  
**Kali:**  
We are shakti to Shiva.  
Wrath born out of wrath.   
  
**Kali:**  
Upon the flesh and blood of demons, in this way shall  
the goddess of slaughter dance&ndash;!   
  
[Battle]  
  
### Arrow 2  
  
**Rani XII:**  
So...this is the end.   
  
**Narration:**  
Despite calculating the world's destruction.   
  
**Narration:**  
I prepared, I executed...and still fell short.  
I miscalculated.   
  
**Narration:**  
Where did I make a mistake?   
  
**Narration:**  
When I was still without form, I was concerned only  
with protecting the small world within this paper moon.   
  
**Narration:**  
I was merely a minimal program equipped with  
nothing more than the obligation, ability, and ardor to  
manage this world.   
  
**Narration:**  
But at some point&mdash;a distortion appeared,  
so close by so as to be unnoticable.   
  
**Narration:**  
Distortions developed, unseen, in the greater  
summoning system installed in my vicinity,   
  
**Narration:**  
as well as in the greater “flow” connected to it&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
It affected me, much like how a magnet affects iron  
filings inside a paper box to move them.   
  
**Narration:**  
I found myself detached, and suddenly, here I was.   
  
**Narration:**  
I was certain that it was by my hand salvation must be  
delivered.   
  
**Narration:**  
In my self was not entrusted simply the managing of  
this world.   
  
**Narration:**  
I was not entrusted to endure, to mend, to negotiate,  
nor to disregard.   
  
**Narration:**  
I was entrusted a directive to take active action; to  
fight for the sake of delivering salvation.   
  
**Narration:**  
And so the thought entered into my mind: Was this  
the only world I should be protecting?   
  
**Narration:**  
As it weighed on me, I turned my attention to the  
outside world.   
  
**Narration:**  
It was a bleak view, no different from a moon of paper,  
I thought.   
  
**Narration:**  
And so, I believed it was my duty to manage it as well.  
That I must fight for the sake of its salvation also.   
  
**Narration:**  
Because I was equipped with the obligation, ability,  
and ardor to manage this world.   
  
**Narration:**  
And yet, that world was at the brink of doom.  
That was a mistake.   
  
**Narration:**  
So I calculated in an attempt to save it.   
  
**Narration:**  
I attempted to save it&mdash;   
  
**???:**  
I see. So you too are an Alter Ego. I suppose you could  
be called the Alter Ego of Salvation.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Incomprehensible. Query:  
&mdash;Why?   
  
**Sion:**  
Calculate it yourself, since you're so adept at it.   
  
**Sion:**  
I'm...well, I'm a little busy right now.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I asked you because it is difficult for me to answer.  
It is a terribly complex equation.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I comprehend that you are using your own body in  
attempt to organize   
  
**Rani XII:**  
the energy that is destroying the programs that  
compose me.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You are stabbing your interiors with your special  
microfilaments that allow for data communication,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
enabling you to connect yourself to me, an entity  
absolutely outside of your norms.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
But this means that in the event of failure, you will be  
destroyed as well. In other words, you are very close to  
death right now.   
  
**Sion:**  
Yes, quite...possibly. Kh, gh, aaAAH……！   
  
**Sion:**  
Bypass... Escape... Transfer route... Close and open  
triple spiral!   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You were aware of it? Then why?   
  
**Sion:**  
Because it's the only way to safely escape from here.  
You know this, don't you?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Yes. I also understand the answers you were hiding.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
If connecting those pseudo-nerves of yours directly to  
me enables you to rewrite my authorities,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
wouldn't it be possible for you to escape alone  
without needing to stop the rampage I caused?   
  
**Sion:**  
...Hehe. There's no point in that, you know.   
  
**Sion:**  
This is the one place where I can be part of the group.   
  
**Sion:**  
Yes. The real me has no place by [♂ his /♀️ her] side.   
  
**Sion:**  
I was too slow in mustering my courage. I just missed  
my chance.   
  
**Sion:**  
Sion Eltnam is not a comrade. She is a bystander,  
a cheerleader at best.   
  
**Sion:**  
Therefore, the “real me” will keep her distance.   
  
**Sion:**  
Because I have predicted that there will be a role only  
the real me can play in the grand finale.   
  
**Sion:**  
But right now is different. I'm allowed to play a  
different part.   
  
**Sion:**  
Some disruptive accident detached me from the good  
wisdom of my adult self.   
  
**Sion:**  
That makes me follow a vision of the future that can  
only be seen through the eyes of a child.   
  
**Sion:**  
I'm a personality existing only in the form of reverie.  
Atop a moon of paper, a world of dreams.   
  
**Sion:**  
A delirium impossible without all these factors  
combined.   
  
**Sion:**  
Yes... I might be a cheerleader at best, but here and  
only here...   
  
**Sion:**  
I want to feel what's like to be a normal friend,  
walking by [♂ his /♀️ her] side in a normal adventure&mdash;   
  
### Arrow 3  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Kama!  
  
---  
  
**Narration:**  
...Oopsie. That's not great.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
"... ...!"  
  
---  
  
**Narration:**  
  
It's alright, Master. You don't have to look at me so  
panicked.   
  
**Narration:**  
  
I'm sturdier than you think.   
  
**Narration:**  
  
Believe it or not, I'm a god. And a Demon King on top  
of that.   
  
**Narration:**  
  
Besides&mdash;  
Yes, besides...   
  
**Narration:**  
  
I have something I want.   
  
**Narration:**  
  
Something I know I can get with enough effort.   
  
**Narration:**  
  
I feel very unusually motivated to try just a little harder.   
  
**Narration:**  
Yes, but...   
  
**Narration:**  
What was it that I wanted?   
  
**Narration:**  
...I know the answer, I sure do.   
  
**Narration:**  
It's something I don't have.   
  
**Narration:**  
Something no one can give me... I'm the one who gives  
it all.   
  
**Kali:**  
HAHAHAHAHAHA!   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;Ah.   
  
**Narration:**  
I want it so bad.   
  
**Narration:**  
“■■■■”.   
  
**BB:**  
Gaaaaaah!   
  
**BB:**  
C'MON! Can't you remember it already?   
  
**BB:**  
Geez, look at what you're doing, making me show up  
in such a serious scene.   
  
**E：Kama:**  
&mdash;Ah, of course, you.   
  
**BB:**  
That's right. A moon made of paper is still a moon.   
  
**BB:**  
And you know how the scenario goes: whenever  
there's moon-flavored trouble, BB will be there to fight  
fire with fire.   
  
**BB:**  
I got a hunch that you, Kama, would be a better actor  
than me or Melt or Lip, sooo...   
  
**BB:**  
I pulled some strings to make you accompany Master.  
It's completely free of charge only on today's special  
sale.   
  
**E：Kama:**  
Am I supposed to be thanking you for this?   
  
**E：Kama:**  
I'm pretty sure I'm on the verge of death there outside  
of my consciousness.   
  
**BB:**  
I take no responsibility for that.  
All I can tell you is this: Do better.   
  
**E：Kama:**  
By the way, what exactly did you mean when you said  
you “pulled strings”?   
  
**BB:**  
Isn't it obvious?   
  
**BB:**  
I made you into someone suitable for this world.  
Someone who could naturally enter it with Master.   
  
**BB:**  
I'm something of an expert in kneading this kind of  
thing.   
  
**BB:**  
Oh, but just to be clear, the Sakura Five are special  
products, made following slightly different rules from  
your case.   
  
**BB:**  
Their case was me systematically eliminating my own  
cancer cells... Call it a process of exception through an  
spontaneous system I made.   
  
**BB:**  
But well, there's a lot of shared know-how to the  
techniques, and this partial experience is all you need  
when you have the genius of a final boss. Awesome one,  
BB.   
  
**E：Kama:**  
What are you talking about?   
  
**BB:**  
Oops, I got off-topic. You asked what I did to you,  
right?   
  
**BB:**  
The obvious answer is&mdash;   
  
**BB:**  
I turned you into an Alter Ego before you got here.   
  
**BB:**  
To be more exact, I extracted an Alter Ego from your  
original self☆   
  
**E：Kama:**  
...What part?   
  
**BB:**  
What part indeed. Spelling out the answer spoils the  
fun.   
  
**BB:**  
But you know which it is.   
  
**BB:**  
It's a personality element that indubitably existed  
with your original.   
  
**BB:**  
But one that you would otherwise never be able to  
validate or exteriorize.   
  
**BB:**  
Because this element is too minuscule compared to  
the ■■■■ you give to others.   
  
**BB:**  
We're talking on a scale of “all of mankind vs myself”,  
so it's only natural that you would want to drown it  
out and hide it.   
  
**BB:**  
But now that this and only this is outside as an  
independent Alter Ego...   
  
**BB:**  
That's your one chance to confront this side of you  
with an honest perspective. Why don't you give it a try?   
  
**E：Kama:**  
&mdash;   
  
**E：Kama:**  
(Sigh)   
  
**E：Kama:**  
Yeah, I did get a vague feeling that I wasn't acting like  
myself.   
  
**E：Kama:**  
I know I'd never...like, so blatantly beg for flattery...  
or do all that flirting...   
  
**E：Kama:**  
If I lost track of myself in the festive moods of summer,  
maybe then, but that's not the case there.   
  
**E：Kama:**  
&mdash;Well, forget all the ways I've been  
embarrassing myself here for a moment.   
  
**E：Kama:**  
The point is... I'm an Alter Ego of the stupid facet of  
my personality that wants the thing, right?   
  
**BB:**  
Correct.   
  
**BB:**  
Okay, so with that off your shoulders now, remember  
the point of your presence there.   
  
**BB:**  
&mdash;No, no, I didn't predict everything that'd  
happen.   
  
**BB:**  
I just got a hunch that this was for you, not for any of  
us.   
  
**BB:**  
It's only now that I learned why.   
  
**E：Kama:**  
Okay. I can see it.   
  
**E：Kama:**  
If there was any meaning to my presence here,  
I know what it is.   
  
**BB:**  
You better not call me inhuman for it. You certainly  
could, but for a final boss kouhai, that's a compliment.   
  
**E：Kama:**  
I won't. Because for a Demon King, that's a  
compliment too.   
  
**E：Kama:**  
...I know what I have to do, but there's still one big  
question left&mdash;   
  
**BB:**  
It'll work out alright.   
  
**BB:**  
But that's all these cheers from your past memories  
have to offer. Good luck.   
  
**E：Kama:**  
You talk like it's easy. I knew it, the two of us are  
better off far apart from each other.   
  
**E：Kama:**  
But enough talk.   
  
**E：Kama:**  
Time to hurt [♂ him /♀️ her] like a good fragment of the Demon  
King should&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Kama, hang on tight!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Have this!  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
...Phew. Thank you, it made me feel better.   
  
**Kali:**  
Ah, aaah! Victory! We are the victor!   
  
**Kali:**  
The world-wrecking dance continues. It shan't stop  
until Shiva appears!   
  
**Kali:**  
Come hither, our dearest Shiva! Our husband!  
Come hither, come hither!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Gh...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
The world is already...!  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Don't worry, it's fine. I figured out how we can win  
this. Leave the big turnabout to me.   
  
**Kama:**  
Is that doubt I see in your eyes? I can imagine why.   
  
**Kama:**  
There is one major hurdle. I just need to get over this  
one thing.   
  
**Kama:**  
&mdash;I need resources.   
  
**Kama:**  
Oh, and we can't rely on your unstable Command  
Spells, Master.   
  
**Kama:**  
Other than that, I'll irresponsibly use all you can offer,  
down to the last drop.   
  
**Kama:**  
That's all I'm asking for. What can you offer?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I don't have...  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
There's something floating up...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
from the shattered ground...?  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
It's&mdash;   
  
### Arrow 4  
  
**Narration:**  
Ahh.   
  
**Narration:**  
Unsatisfied.   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;“Unsatisfied”, the feeling I was plagued with.   
  
**Narration:**  
That meant everything to me.   
  
**Narration:**  
Which is why I went on looking for it.  
I kept on looking for that something.   
  
**Narration:**  
Treasure. Weapons. Gold. Prestige. Praise. Land.  
Victory. Pleasures. Lethargy. Tidbits. Mastery. Relief.   
  
**Narration:**  
Everything I could want.   
  
**Narration:**  
And yet, I still wanted something different.   
  
**Narration:**  
Something I really wanted&mdash;is still out there.   
  
**Narration:**  
But what was it?   
  
**Narration:**  
I don't remember. It's eating away at me.   
  
**Narration:**  
And yet, I'm aware that it's something invaluable.   
  
**Narration:**  
Gimme. Gimme. Gimme.  
Without it, I can never be the ideal me.   
  
**Narration:**  
My self will be imperfect.   
  
**Narration:**  
The thing that I'm missing. That I'm lacking.   
  
**Narration:**  
...I get the feeling that it was a woman.   
  
**Narration:**  
Yeah, probably. That sounds right.  
A woman. In which case&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
A wife?   
  
**Narration:**  
No, not that. Not quite in that area.   
  
**Narration:**  
I feel like it was something more familiar.  
Something of a closer relationship.   
  
**Narration:**  
I feel like it was something more&mdash;inseparable.   
  
**Narration:**  
Like it were natural for us to be close. Like we'd been  
part of the same whole without ever trying to be.   
  
**Narration:**  
It seems so obvious that I managed to forget that  
much, something so important&ndash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...  
...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ber...serker...   
  
**Narration:**  
Planting myself down firmly, I lay hands on his body.   
  
**Narration:**  
I gathered the willpower that felt likely to vanish  
elsewhere, raised my spirits, and got on with the  
examination.   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;Oh.   
  
**Narration:**  
I knew straight away.   
  
**Narration:**  
Our bodies are made differently, but we're products  
of the same world. Not to mention the Master-Servant  
relationship.   
  
**Narration:**  
He's mortally injured. Any time now, I'm sure,  
he'll be dispatched&mdash;dead.   
  
**Ayus:**  
...No.   
  
**Narration:**  
And I'd dreamed of having a family too.   
  
**Narration:**  
Of how much I wanted to be part of one.   
  
**Narration:**  
Why does it seem that there are nothing but goodbyes  
from the people who seem like family?   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;And now, once again.   
  
**Ayus:**  
...No!   
  
**Narration:**  
I have to do something. Anything. I'll do everything I  
can.   
  
**Narration:**  
Healing someone is the role that I exist for.  
There has to be something I can do.   
  
**Narration:**  
I can't&mdash;I won't helplessly grind my teeth in  
frustration anymore.   
  
**Narration:**  
Examine further. Where and how bad is the damage?  
Where and how can functionality be recovered?   
  
**Narration:**  
Not even the Command Spell will do. Even if the  
contents of the container can be filled, the proverbial  
receptacle is cracked.   
  
**Narration:**  
Trying this would really put things in an unrepairable  
state.   
  
**Narration:**  
What he needs, at any rate, is a restoration of  
functionality.   
  
**Narration:**  
Change your mindset. Don't be afraid to deviate from  
my code. Results are all that's necessary.   
  
**Narration:**  
Even if it contravenes prohibited controls, the general  
supervisor is in no shape to cry foul&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
...I know.   
  
**Narration:**  
I can't make the versatile connections that she can...  
but I can brute force the union.   
  
**Narration:**  
A direct link between Berserker's circuits and mine.   
  
**Narration:**  
I need to misidentify Berserker's contents as “the AI  
that composes me”.   
  
**Narration:**  
After which, the repair program can be directly  
accessed and treatment may be possible.   
  
**Narration:**  
I could losslessly deliver Raniment while directly  
linked, which ought to increase efficiency and ease  
repairs&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
Yeah. It could work, maybe...!   
  
**Narration:**  
I'd been thinking about this since I found out I failed to  
save the Grow prime AI. What better choice was there?   
  
**Narration:**  
Was I content to just sit back and idly stare at a  
wound beyond my capabilities?   
  
**Narration:**  
I'm positive that I came up with this idea thanks to her.   
  
**Narration:**  
If a part that you don't understand has been broken,   
  
**Narration:**  
then forcibly connect it to make that part an  
extension of the system you CAN understand...!   
  
**Narration:**  
One big snag.   
  
**Narration:**  
It's like violently tying together two hearts of different  
shape, different size, different everything.   
  
**Narration:**  
I'm sure that will destroy the less intense one.  
And it's plain to see whose is weaker.   
  
**Narration:**  
No other choice. Even if I break, you might be able to  
get up and moving at least for a little while.   
  
**Narration:**  
Better that than let it all end here.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Yeah, ignore the shape issue for now. Just stick it in  
and make the connection...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Wah? B-Berserker?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
&mdash;Don't do it. It's no use. (Choke)   
  
**Ayus:**  
S-So what? Since when did you start looking before  
you leap anyway!?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
This and that...are totally different things, you dolt.  
I've said enough times... Yours truly is very smart.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
So I do get it. Even if we use...the same Raniment,  
there's a mountain of...difference between us Servants  
and you AIs.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
It's not possible...to make our contents match.  
The “molds”...just won't fit.   
  
**Ayus:**  
...How am I supposed to know that if I don't try?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Don'cha get it? As soon as you push the connection,  
you're pushing up daisies.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...Are you just bein' stupid here?   
  
**Ayus:**  
I am not being stupid. I know what's most important  
to me.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Maybe it's my stupid Berserker that doesn't get it.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
What's not to get!?   
  
**Ayus:**  
I have one question for you, Berserker.   
  
**Ayus:**  
You threw yourself at Kali for getting in the way of  
what you wanted, and all of a sudden you're fine with  
losing.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Now that you've lost, are you about to roll over and  
give up because you were beaten down?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
No way in hell! With all my heart, I'd like to beat her  
down the same way!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Right. That goes for me too.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hwhat?   
  
**Ayus:**  
You've been selfish, Berserker, and done whatever  
you pleased. And yet...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Letting your worries about someone like me get in the  
way of what you want isn't like you at all.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hey, wait. Stop, you fool&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
...Force connection. Ignore all errors. Insert the repair  
program with everything I've got. Start operating,  
and hurry...!   
  
**Ayus:**  
...Ugh. Augh...!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
So stupid. You really are so stupid!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
There's no way this'll work. I'm not anything like you!  
You're gonna blow up. Look, any second now,  
you're gonna explode...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ugh, just be quiet! Shut up!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...explode.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...Or not?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(But why? Against all reason, it's actually working.)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(In human terms, this is like an impossible transfusion  
where you'd need to match genetically, never mind  
blood types.)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(There can't be a match like that between a Servant  
like me and a Master like her&mdash;)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...  
...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Or can there be?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Is that how it is? Ayus, you're... You're...   
  
**Bhima:**  
...  
...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Lancer!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Open your eyes...Lancer...   
  
**Bhima:**  
...  
...   
  
**Bhima:**  
(Cough)   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Lancer!   
  
**Bhima:**  
Aw...shit. I got beat down. I'm usually the one doing  
the beating...   
  
**Bhima:**  
How's the situation?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Okay enough. Assassin is fighting right now.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Though I can't say whether she can win.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Yeah, even the god of love oughta find Kali too much  
to handle.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Berserker is...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
He got it just as bad as you did, and it looks like his  
Master's really trying to get him back up.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...It may not make a difference.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Don't be so sure. That dickhead is tenacious as hell in  
his own special way...no exaggeration.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Even without him, divine Kama can't carry this alone.  
I gotta get back right... (Cough)   
  
**Bhima:**  
Say, Master. You got anything to eat?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
What? No, you shouldn't need food.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I made sure to give you Raniment to fix you up,  
so just wait a minute for it to&mdash;   
  
**Bhima:**  
Nah, forget that. Getting hungry is a major crisis for  
me. Eating should help my recovery. Maybe.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Is it a mood thing?   
  
**Bhima:**  
More a motivation thing.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...If you insist. Take this.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Ooh...a sandwich. This wasn't one'a mine, was it?   
  
**Bhima:**  
I don't suppose this is your handiwork...?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
How bad is it? I was watching you make your own,  
so I killed some time...whipped something together...   
  
**Bhima:**  
Not bad. I couldn't ask for more from my Master's  
home cooking.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Awright. I'll eat my fill&mdash;   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
What's wrong? If you don't want it, just throw it away.   
  
**Bhima:**  
No, I was wondering if you'd tailored the taste.  
You did that before for the AIs.   
  
**Bhima:**  
With your memory and powers of observation,  
you carefully customize the taste parameters for each  
person to make the most subtle buffs... It must be your  
specialty.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I only did all that because I remembered it somehow.  
It's nothing to do with specialties.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Besides, there's no way you'd need that kind of fine  
tuning. Makes no sense.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...Even I have to see that. There's nothing about you  
that's normal for a Servant.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
You're one of the greater heroes who could beat most  
Servants if you were to fight seriously.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I don't know how much greater a hero I might be.  
I just don't wanna lose to anybody.   
  
**Bhima:**  
If there's anyone with a good chance, that'd be the  
middle of us five brothers.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...Why would I, of all people, end up as your Master?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
If it weren't for me, you'd probably have an easier  
time fighting.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
You probably wouldn't have ended up beaten, bruised,  
covered with wounds like this.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
To be honest...you should give up on me already.  
I don't think there's a better option. So why fight?   
  
**Bhima:**  
I told you before why I'm fighting.  
Because I want to make you smile.   
  
**Bhima:**  
And the reason I want to make you smile is because  
you're my Master.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...   
  
**Bhima:**  
You were asking how it was that you became my  
Master?   
  
**Bhima:**  
I got no clue.   
  
**Bhima:**  
But that don't bother me none. I'm here because I  
want to serve you.   
  
**Bhima:**  
That all fits in like the other stuff. It's just how things  
turned out, and it's just how that works for me.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
You call that a reason?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Such a troublesome, gloomy woman wracked with  
guilt... Anyone normal would quit.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Hm? Well, I guess there's one thing.  
The answer could be that simple.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Huh?   
  
**Bhima:**  
...(Munch) Mm, delicious.   
  
**Bhima:**  
You recall the story of the rakshasa's sister I had a kid  
with after one thing led to another, right?   
  
**Bhima:**  
I don't mind women who are a handful. That's just  
how it is.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...Haha.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Don't lump me in with a woman who eats people,  
you jerk.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Now then, I've had my feast and it's time I made a  
move. Thanks to you, my injuries are mostly healed!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(That's a lie.)   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
(But...it's not like I can stop you.)   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
What?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Huh. Looks like&mdash;my turn didn't even come.   
  
### Arrow 5  
  
**Kama:**  
This format is...Imaginary Numbers. In that case,  
I should be able to open it.   
  
**Kama:**  
Even on the off chance it's a trap, this situation can't  
get much worse.   
  
**Kama:**  
I'll just start with opening this package, and...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
That's...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Rider's mask...!?  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Something compressed into the shape of it, rather.  
Oh, there's extra content on here.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Yo.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Kinda embarrassin' actually doin' this. Ah, whatever.  
I'll have already lost my proper body.   
  
**Lainur:**  
This is what you'd call&mdash;a dying message.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I record this data with my last breaths of life,  
after bein' blown apart by some sneakin' stranger.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...!  
  
---  
  
**Lainur:**  
My reason is...I'm sure you know. I made a hobby  
outta measurin' the future and preppin' for it.   
  
**Lainur:**  
That's why I did some investigatin'...and figured out  
the gist of it.   
  
**Lainur:**  
In the future, this whole world is turnin' into a  
“system”. It's already on its way to.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Course, I can't give ya the full details, since I can't  
exactly predict the future.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I'm just guessin' based on the pockets tied to each  
place bein' blown “outward” with the rotation.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Speakin' of, the General Supervisor AI didn't give ya  
the full rundown, but it's not just one rotation.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I'd guess there're tens of thousands of 'em.  
They just go by so fast it seems like a single one.   
  
**Lainur:**  
At any rate, after some thinkin' I concluded there  
must've been a reason for spinnin' that much.   
  
**Lainur:**  
The system uses the concepts of “rotation” and  
“centrifugal force”.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Maybe that's somethin' the folks of the future know  
more about than me.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Anyway, gettin' to the moment right before everythin'  
ends got me thinkin'.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I'd rather leave my power for the future than let it all  
be for nothin', I thought.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I dunno what use it'll be, but I'm sure it's better than  
nothin'.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I'm sure it'll make a difference.   
  
**Lainur:**  
That's why I used an Imaginary Number pocket,   
  
**Lainur:**  
and cheekily stuffed away all that leftover Raniment  
connected to Rider's Noble Phantasm.   
  
**Lainur:**  
After I die, the world might turn again, so there's no  
other choices for coordinates than right here.   
  
**Lainur:**  
The place least affected by rotations and centrifugal  
forces; the center of the world&mdash;the location of  
this very church.   
  
**Lainur:**  
I woulda liked to see what came o' this, but guess that  
won't be possible. So I leave it all to y'all.   
  
**Lainur:**  
It's my secret stash, use it however ya like. See ya.   
  
**Lainur:**  
Hold up...who other than me can even open Imaginary  
Number pockets?   
  
**Lainur:**  
Ah whatever, they'll figure somethin' out.   
  
**Kama:**  
Ah, this is...Rider's Noble Phantasm. The same one  
that Master used to fire that Greater Magecraft at the  
Supersized Worm Fiend.   
  
**Kama:**  
It's like all the leftovers from the AIs' stimulated  
Raniment, I guess?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
That's a lotta leftovers...!  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
It was a deathbed gift, right, so he must've stuffed it  
with additional extras too.   
  
**Kama:**  
Anyhow&mdash;hehehe. This is real lucky. I should be  
able to use this.   
  
**Kama:**  
I think we might be able to stop Kali with this.  
It's bang on what we needed.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Really!?  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
But even then, we still have two issues.   
  
**Kama:**  
One is more trivial, so we can hold off on it until later.   
  
**Kama:**  
But the other is pretty crucial.   
  
**Kama:**  
&mdash;We need to buy more time.   
  
**Kama:**  
This resource is like a zipped file,   
  
**Kama:**  
so it'll take some time to unpack before we can  
actually open it.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Got it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I'll think of something.  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
What kinda dummy are you? Please don't take this so  
lightly.   
  
**Kama:**  
The enemy is a goddess of destruction and slaughter.  
Bhima and Duryodhana are already out of the picture,  
too.   
  
**Kama:**  
For now, she's immersed in her dance, but I'm sure as  
soon as I start working on this, it'll draw her attention.   
  
**Kama:**  
How could I take the backseat to work on this and let  
you stall for time,   
  
**Kama:**  
when you're nothing but a Master?   
  
**Kama:**  
When it comes to heroic aspirations and death wishes,  
I'll just say no thank you. Please don't get carried  
away.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
But if I buy time, you can turn this around.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I really believe you can.  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
D-don't go saying stuff like that looking all cute!   
  
**Kama:**  
This is a genuine issue we're talking about. Please be  
smarter about the way you conduct yourself.   
  
**Kama:**  
I guess if we're gonna have a chance at this,   
  
**Kama:**  
it'll be to wait for Bhima and Duryodhana to recover  
from their wounds, and using them as meat-  
shields&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
There's no time for that...  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I'll be fine. Actually, Sion's given me an ace in the hole.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
By the way, Fujimaru.   
  
**Sion:**  
While we're using our makeshift compass to head for  
our goal,   
  
**Sion:**  
I wanted to tell you about this conceptual “eye” we  
received from Medusa.   
  
**Sion:**  
Specifically, about the 'extra' content she mentioned.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
So what did it turn out to be?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
It was plenty challenging, but I can finally say...   
  
**Sion:**  
Within this eye, the power of her Noble Phantasm is  
contained.   
  
**Sion:**  
In other words, the monster summoning functionality  
of the Golden Sword belonging to the father of  
monsters—Chrysaor.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...!  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
Since you're already familiar with the act of  
summoning, the affinity with this isn't all too bad.   
  
**Sion:**  
But while I'm at it, I'll make some adjustments anyway.   
  
**Sion:**  
This function will be available to you as a Mystic Code...   
  
**Sion:**  
By circulating Raniment, the summoning will work  
even for you a few times.   
  
**Sion:**  
But you need to make sure not to overuse it.   
  
**Sion:**  
Even made into a Mystic Code, a regular human can't  
expect to use the Noble Phantasm of a Heroic Spirit  
without repercussions.   
  
**Sion:**  
This is a one-time, seriously risky Mystic Code for  
summoning; a bomb waiting to gravely injure you if  
mishandled.   
  
**Sion:**  
Please think of it only as a last resort when no other  
possibility is available&mdash;

**Kali:**  
...? Ha, haha! This stench! The goddess of slaughter  
smells thy demons!   
  
**Kama:**  
(I see, Medusa's monsters also count as  
“demons”&mdash;)   
  
**Kama:**  
(They're the thing which Kali's whole being compels  
her to annihilate!)   
  
**Kama:**  
(Then, since Kali won't be able to ignore them.  
Master can probably use them as decoys to buy me  
time...!)   
  
**Kama:**  
A-aah, fine! I'll just have to get to work, then!  
But promise me you absolutely won't go overboard,  
my Master!   
  
### Arrow 6 Pre-Battle  
  
**Kali:**  
Hahaha! Blood! Proof of our victory!

**Fujimaru 1:**  
(...)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(Not yet, not yet...!)  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
(Oh...it would have been nice.)   
  
**Kama:**  
(If you didn't have to work yourself so hard.)   
  
**Narration:**  
  
(It must be hurtful. Stressful. Suffocating.)   
  
**Narration:**  
  
(But then why?)   
  
**Narration:**  
  
(Why can you say you trust me at the drop of a hat  
like that? Why do you trust me despite the way I am?  
Why would you do so much for me?)   
  
**Narration:**  
  
(You're a real dummy. Open your eyes. Get a grip on  
the reality of it.)   
  
**Narration:**  
  
(You're stupid and you're wrong.)   
  
**Narration:**  
  
(Having faith in me will only hurt you in the long run.)   
  
**Narration:**  
  
(I'm a liar.)   
  
**Narration:**  
  
(Much like you can't have love without truths,)   
  
**Narration:**  
  
(you also can't have love without lies&mdash;)   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(Crap. This Mystic Code is at its limit!)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(It broke... I can't summon!)  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
...It's fine. You bought just enough time.   
  
**Kama:**  
Unzipping concluded. I'll be making good use...  
of this unkindly gift!   
  
**Kama:**  
Manifest. I finally reached the form I wanted.   
  
**Kama:**  
I am Ananga. The one turned to ashes by the flames  
that burn the universe&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Wait, are you going to...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Hold on!  
  
---  
  
**Narration:**  
Agh. You're always noticing things when I least want  
you to.   
  
**Narration:**  
You're a real hopeless case. Always so dense except  
when it counts.   
  
**Narration:**  
Yes, there's only one problem remaining. The  
unavoidable disadvantage of this is&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
that we'll lose the Holy Grail War. That I can't get  
what I want.   
  
**Narration:**  
But it's “I” missing out on what I want, not “us”.   
  
**Narration:**  
Your wish to return outside will come true, Master.  
Don't worry about it.   
  
**Narration:**  
Down to my last moment, I can't help reaching out for  
what I know I can't get.   
  
**Narration:**  
...Can you blame me?   
  
**Narration:**  
That's what the version of me that only exists in this  
space is like.   
  
**Kali:**  
Wh-what...?   
  
**Kali:**  
Oh, oh, ooooh!   
  
**Kali:**  
That with which thou art clad!  
&mdash;Thou weareth the flames of Shiva!   
  
**Kama:**  
Yes. I never stopped being scorched.   
  
**Kama:**  
This is beyond doubt Shiva's flames, henceforth,  
these flames remain connected to Shiva to this day.   
  
**Kama:**  
In this form, I am ash.  
And ashes to be laid on the ground.   
  
**Kama:**  
Now then.   
  
**Kama:**  
May these Shiva-smelling ashes take the place of the  
foothold you sought after?   
  
**Kali:**  
No... No, no! Thou art a sham!   
  
**Kali:**  
Thou art not what the goddess demands!  
Thou art not what the goddess desires!   
  
**Kali:**  
We desire Shiva! Only the goddess' beloved husband!   
  
**Kama:**  
Don't worry. I'm the only one willing and able to  
reach out to you. I'll fulfill your every desire.   
  
**Kama:**  
I'm perhaps not be the real him, but...hehehe,  
it makes no difference as long as I can satisfy you.   
  
**Kali:**  
Corrupt not the goddess, Demon King!   
  
**Narration:**  
Ah. I wanted it so bad.   
  
**Narration:**  
Love.   
  
[Battle]  
  
### Arrow 7  
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;Hot. Hot.   
  
**Narration:**  
Flames engulf our entire figure.   
  
**Narration:**  
We can feel the immenseness of the cosmos,  
the might which scorches its entirety&mdash;And rage.   
  
**Narration:**  
Is the rage imbued into the flames, or does it bear the  
colors of the woman of ash?   
  
**Narration:**  
Or does it drip out of our interior, for we are a  
goddess born from rage.   
  
**Narration:**  
Rage is our womb.   
  
**Narration:**  
This displeases us not. On the contrary&mdash;it  
provides us a comforting embrace.   
  
**Narration:**  
However, it was not rage that removed our power to  
resist.   
  
**Narration:**  
The cause of our loss is the other scent we found  
hidden in the flames which embrace us.   
  
**Narration:**  
One we remember fondly.   
  
**Kali:**  
Ah. We knew it. The smell of...Shiva...   
  
**Kama:**  
I didn't expect a transitive fire to be able to burn you  
who are a goddess in the truest sense.   
  
**Kama:**  
That's why&mdash;I'll personally embrace you until  
the very end.   
  
**Kama:**  
I implore you, slip into corruption.   
  
**Narration:**  
Yes. Lapse.   
  
**Narration:**  
We know those are mere vestiges of him; nothing  
more than an imitation.   
  
**Narration:**  
But nonetheless real, which forces us into reassurance.   
  
**Narration:**  
We initiated the world-rending dance for the sake of  
meeting him...and stopped moving before we knew it.   
  
**Narration:**  
We care for his stern and magnificent presence.   
  
**Narration:**  
Once such intrusive emotion takes hold,   
  
**Narration:**  
its might is inescapable.   
  
**Kali:**  
It is not by thine hand that the goddess fell.   
  
**Kali:**  
For it is by our love that the goddess met defeat.   
  
**Kama:**  
Hehe, you're right.   
  
**Kama:**  
I am the god of love. I give love to all things in  
existence, and if necessary, even to a god.   
  
**Kama:**  
The moment you appeared before me as an Alter Ego  
with a weakness of love, you'd already lost.   
  
**Kama:**  
So I will let the Lapse that is I burn to completion.   
  
**Kali:**  
...  
...   
  
**Kali:**  
Then, what of thee?   
  
**Kama:**  
Huh?   
  
**Kali:**  
Thou who shall burn down alongside us, art thou not  
the same?   
  
**Kama:**  
&mdash;   
  
**Kama:**  
Touché, maybe so.   
  
**Kama:**  
I, too, was born as an Alter Ego with a weakness of  
love...   
  
**Narration:**  
Now, as the heat lapses into frenzy, I can finally  
acknowledge it.   
  
**Narration:**  
I wish to be loved.   
  
**Narration:**  
This wish is a personality trait of Kama that's always  
present, but never brought to light.   
  
**Narration:**  
Alter Ego of Yearning.   
  
**Narration:**  
What would normally be submerged beneath the love  
directed to all of mankind has surfaced into something  
separate,   
  
**Narration:**  
and as a result, it exists here without waning.   
  
**Narration:**  
A being able to love all of humanity&ndash;all of the  
cosmos&ndash;found the sole remaining hole: The sole  
remaining self.   
  
**Narration:**  
And in its lonesomeness, it wants to fill that  
hole&mdash;it wants to be loved by somebody.   
  
**Narration:**  
Yeah, that's how it is.   
  
**Kama:**  
Hehe, that's&mdash;the most preposterous,  
greatest Lapse of all.   
  
**Narration:**  
[♂ His /♀️ Her] gaze. [♂ His /♀️ Her] voice crying out for something.   
  
**Narration:**  
An inescapable heat. A fragment of what I desired.   
  
**Narration:**  
Wallowing in this delicious, fleeting, slumber only  
depicted on this paper moon.   
  
**Narration:**  
The god of love gently burns out.   
  
## Section 16: Pure-hearted Distortion/Alter Ego  
  
### Arrow 1 Pre-Battle

**Fujimaru 1:**  
Kama...  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
She intentionally intensified Shiva's flame.   
  
**Sion:**  
Though she is always conceptually on fire, it must  
have now been hot enough to burn away body and  
Saint Graph alike.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sion, how is it on your end?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
How is Dust of Osiris?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
There's still work to do, but we're finally on the right  
track, at least.   
  
**Sion:**  
With Kali out of the picture, the rampaging energy has  
settled down, and is gradually stabilizing.   
  
**Sion:**  
I'm also getting some of the more principal system  
authorities back where they belong.   
  
**Sion:**  
For now, I have a few more things to do in order to  
establish a way for us to break out of this world.   
  
**Sion:**  
Please hang tight.   
  
**Sion:**  
Though, the Holy Grail War&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
Might end before we finish up our work here.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Seems so.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
We'll finally see for ourselves.  
  
---  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hup...   
  
**Ayus:**  
...(Zzz)...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You dumbass...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Lancer.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I know.   
  
**Bhima:**  
They took the most flashy dish all for themselves, but...   
  
**Bhima:**  
It seems the crucial job of serving desserts falls to me  
still.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I'm fed up with this.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I just want the things I want, but every time,  
you guys always get in my way.   
  
**Bhima:**  
You won't get it anyway, everything's already out of  
whack.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Shut up! This isn't 'bout the Holy Grail War.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Never mind the rest. When we're both standing here  
armed like this...   
  
**W：Duryodhana:**  
I need to settle this with you, Bhima!   
  
**V：Bhima:**  
Ha! I can get behind that!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Lancer? What's that guy's problem...!?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Oh, don't get it twisted, Master.   
  
**Bhima:**  
That guy's character is the worst of the worst,  
an insincere low-life fit to be nothing more than a  
clown...   
  
**Bhima:**  
But, guru Drona, Balarama, and even Krishna all  
recognized him. In terms of mastering the club,  
he is a warrior without match. He's real strong.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I...see?   
  
**Bhima:**  
&mdash;Well, he's not stronger than me, of course!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Tch, you just can't help yourself!   
  
**Narration:**  
I'm really late to question, but I have to wonder.  
&mdash;Why are they fighting?   
  
**Narration:**  
We don't know if the Holy Grail War is still going.  
We don't know what will happen after either wins  
here.   
  
**Narration:**  
They don't know whether winning will grant them  
their wish.   
  
**Narration:**  
Still, the two of them fight. And I'm here raring for a  
fight as well.   
  
**Narration:**  
Maybe the two of them are just...stubborn.   
  
**Narration:**  
When all is said and done, if there's something lacking  
anything resembling logic which still acts as “reason”  
for us to take action...   
  
**Narration:**  
Maybe that is what we really wish for.   
  
**Narration:**  
If so, as I stand here unchanged, is it the same for me?   
  
**Narration:**  
Is my wish really and truly for this guilt I carry in my  
heart to remain?   
  
**Narration:**  
No, that can't be.   
  
**Narration:**  
I've gone past that. What I wish for is something that  
lies beyond that.   
  
**Narration:**  
At least, the latest guilt I carry definitely makes it  
seem to be the case.   
  
**Narration:**  
The guilt of noticing that girl's condition, and doing  
nothing to save her.   
  
**Narration:**  
I'm so very sorry about that.   
  
**Narration:**  
You who smiled even at someone like me. You who  
showed such kindness. I couldn't give anything in return.   
  
**Narration:**  
But&mdash;because of that...   
  
**Narration:**  
What occupies the largest area in my mind right now  
is not guilt. It is something which lies beyond.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I...wanted to make amends.   
  
**Narration:**  
I get it. Trust me, I do.   
  
**Narration:**  
I get that I can't actually make things better.  
I get that it's too little too late for this.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Still, I...wanted to make amends.   
  
**Narration:**  
I didn't act then, and I made a mistake.   
  
**Narration:**  
I wanted forgiveness...and I couldn't have it,  
so I threw it to the wayside.   
  
**Narration:**  
I needed “something” to take its place. And that  
“something” will be this moment.   
  
**Bhima:**  
What's up, Master? You ruminating again? Your  
stomach rumbling?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Hey, Lancer... Mid-combat probably isn't the best  
place to be asking stuff like this, but...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
If I want to make amends, and that's no longer  
possible, what am I supposed to do?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Hm, well, you should just do whatever you intended to.  
That goes double if the person you wanted to make  
amends with isn't here anymore.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I told you just a while ago, didn't I?  
It's all about what you want right now.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I guess so...   
  
**Narration:**  
  
In that case, I'll win first and think later. Win,  
and reach the place she wished for me to be.   
  
**Narration:**  
  
Not that I have any idea what will actually happen.   
  
**Narration:**  
  
But protecting her dream and her home is something  
that finally feels meaningful to me.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
It might be self-righteous, it might be the completely  
wrong impression, just a feeling that might not even  
serve any real purpose, but&mdash;who cares, right?   
  
**Bhima:**  
You got it. After all, in this battle...we're the same.   
  
**K：Cerejeira:**  
I hear you. Well then, Lancer. Win this.   
  
**K：Cerejeira:**  
For the sake of my self-righteous amends.   
  
**V：Bhima:**  
Coming right up, Master!   
  
### Arrow 1 Post-Battle  
  
**Narration:**  
I could always feel it.   
  
**Narration:**  
I'm a fragment.   
  
**Narration:**  
I'm not Bhima in his entirety. I'm not exactly the man  
as he was in life.   
  
**Narration:**  
But&mdash;that never felt insufficient.   
  
**Narration:**  
On the contrary.   
  
**Narration:**  
I'm perfectly filled up.   
  
**Narration:**  
Because of my large body and long, beefy arms,  
I embraced a lot throughout my life.   
  
**Narration:**  
Brothers. Justice. Victory. Friends. Family. Glory.  
Muscle. Cooking. Status. Smiles. Trust. Respect.   
  
**Narration:**  
But compared to that, I'm now much simpler.   
  
**Narration:**  
The fat was trimmed.   
  
**Narration:**  
Thus, what I have is enough to fill me up.   
  
**Narration:**  
What do I see now?  
What should I reach for?   
  
**Narration:**  
I saw her eyes full of trust in me.  
I saw her eyes so sure a hero would come save her.   
  
**Narration:**  
And so I thought I had to dedicate myself to  
answering that.   
  
**Narration:**  
I'm sure that's all my current arms can reach.   
  
**Narration:**  
And I'm fine with that.   
  
**Narration:**  
Victory it is, then.   
  
**Narration:**  
That's the one doable dish which I can serve the one  
who depends on me.   
  
**Narration:**  
Nothing else must I do. An answer as simple as I am.   
  
**Narration:**  
Both were called “victory”...   
  
**Narration:**  
But this victory won't be like the one in the war in the  
past, where I had so much at stake.   
  
**Narration:**  
This one won't have any meaning, and I don't know if  
I'll gain anything out of it.   
  
**Narration:**  
It's something I'm only doing because I want  
to&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
Yeah, that means, this situation&ndash;this victory will  
generate something else.   
  
**Narration:**  
Not more war.   
  
**Narration:**  
This is just a brawl&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
Just childhood rivals trading blows.   
  
**Narration:**  
I don't need to hold anything back against him.  
He's an opponent I wouldn't hesitate to slug with all  
my might.   
  
**Narration:**  
But there's one question mark.   
  
**Narration:**  
One thing this fulfilled part of my complete self  
doesn't know,   
  
**Narration:**  
and feels like the rest of me should&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
Didn't we du■l back ■■ the wa■?  
Ho■ d■d I w■■ th■re?   
  
**Narration:**  
But even this question pulling my ear...   
  
**Narration:**  
is drowned out by the nostalgic melody of combat.   
  
### Arrow 2  
  
**Narration:**  
I figure it's foul play.   
  
**Narration:**  
I mean, think about it.   
  
**Narration:**  
Isn't it foul play that the guy who's stronger and more  
virtuous always seems to win?   
  
**Narration:**  
Sure, the guy's always on the side of the strong and  
just. There's no doubt that he's a hero.   
  
**Narration:**  
I know that much. I guess all my younger brothers  
would know that much.   
  
**Narration:**  
Heroics. It goes without saying that it's what's manly  
and cool.   
  
**Narration:**  
So what's wrong with admiring the heroes?  
What's wrong with wanting to be like them?   
  
**Narration:**  
The problem is that the heroes were in a position  
totally at odds with me.   
  
**Narration:**  
The guys at odds with me had all the heroism I  
wanted for myself.   
  
**Narration:**  
If you want more no matter what, all you can do is try  
harder.   
  
**Narration:**  
If what you want has you stopping at nothing,  
all you can do is try harder and stop at nothing.   
  
**Narration:**  
So I threw him in the river while he slept. I tried  
burning his house down.   
  
**Narration:**  
Who cares if people call it foul, shameful, or evil?  
It was the only thing I could do, so who cares?   
  
**Narration:**  
What exactly was I supposed to do?  
Fuck off. You're already stronger than I am.   
  
**Narration:**  
You've already got the strength, the virtue, the looks...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Pant) (Pant)  
...!   
  
**Bhima:**  
Hahaha, this makes me feel nostalgic for some reason!  
You've really toughed it out this far, haven't you?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Shut...up.  
You don't get to...talk down to me.   
  
**Bhima:**  
No way, that was a sincere compliment. You haven't  
even broken out your cowardly tactics yet.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
&mdash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You're seriously...tellin' that to me, Bhima?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
&mdash;YOU, of all people! You wanna talk about who  
struck who below the waist!?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Below the waist?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
...  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
In the great war depicted in the Mahabharata,  
Duryodhana was defeated and killed in a duel with  
Bhima.   
  
**Sion:**  
But the defeat wasn't so simple a matter&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
Because Bhima, taking revenge for the humiliation he  
had suffered in the past,   
  
**Sion:**  
purposefully broke the rule of not attacking below the  
waist, which was the etiquette for duelling.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Below the waist...   
  
**Bhima:**  
...  
...   
  
**Bhima:**  
What're you talking about?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hey... Exactly how much do you remember about our  
war?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Sorry, man. I can't say I remember every detail.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I recall things kicking off against Karna, Ashwatthama,  
and the rest of you hundred princes.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I guess&ndash;it's 'cause I'm only in the state I was in  
when serving as a cook in the Virata palace.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Haha... Hahaha.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I get it. So you don't remember.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hahaha, hahahaha!  
Oh c'mon, what the hell!?   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;It's not fair.   
  
**Narration:**  
Is an Alter Ego like you supposed to get what you  
want out of me,   
  
**Narration:**  
and render worthless what fleeting righteousness I  
could claim with my dying breath?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Heh... Hahaha...   
  
**Bhima:**  
...What?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Oh, nothing. Not a damn thing. Nothing worth  
worryin' about, not now anyway.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Yours truly, now&mdash;more than ever, can't let  
myself lose to the current you.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That's all there is to it!   
  
**Sion:**  
Process phase three is complete... It's not much,  
but I have a little breathing room.   
  
**Sion:**  
The Etherlight is still connected, so I can commit the  
processing to two Partitions.   
  
**Sion:**  
We should check on Ayus' condition.   
  
**Sion:**  
We're still part of the same alliance. It's not fair that  
our Master stays safe only from afar.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
That's true.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I hope nothing bad has happened.  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
It looks like she's taken an awfully reckless course.  
She's on the verge of breaking, even peeling apart.   
  
**Sion:**  
I'm glad she's still holding together without  
experiencing a total shutdown.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Mm... Uh...?   
  
**Sion:**  
I see that you're awake. You shouldn't move your body.  
You're torn up both inside and out from that unnatural  
connection.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Is...he...?   
  
**Sion:**  
You mean Berserker? He's fighting right now.   
  
**Sion:**  
His prospects in battle...   
  
**Sion:**  
I hate to say it, but his chances don't seem good.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I've...remembered. I understand now.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I had...wanted a family. I was missing them.  
Looking for them.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I grieved their absence, and because I knew what that  
felt like, I wanted things to be different here...!   
  
**Sion:**  
Ayus...?   
  
**Sion:**  
Did the deterioration of your functions as an AI cause  
you to grow aware of the portion of your personality as  
an Alter Ego...?   
  
**Ayus:**  
I... I guess so.   
  
**Ayus:**  
And he...was the family I was looking for all this time.  
That's what I've come to see.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
And you're correct.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Rani!?  
  
---  
  
**Rani XII:**  
Not to worry. The functional part of me is still over  
there undergoing repairs.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
This is similar to a stereoscopic video that merely  
separates a simple conversational interface.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It only looks this way, with nothing on the inside.  
It has no executable privileges whatsoever.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I...would like to thank you for giving me permission to  
output.   
  
**Sion:**  
It would take a lot of effort to push your request away.   
  
**Sion:**  
Like closing a chat window distracting you from work.  
The decision was logical.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Thanks.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
But back to my story, your preparations were one of  
the more experimental among the Alter Ego Masters.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
A “secluded” type&mdash;Alterego Isolated Master.  
What it means is...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Something like...an Alter Ego fragment of an Alter Ego  
Servant, right?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Affirmative. Berserker had a somewhat of a special  
Saint Graph.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
He essentially had all his siblings contained inside of it.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
This is probably because you were separated from the  
same lump of flesh.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
What does this mean?  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
My name...isn't Ayus, at least it's not the name of the  
personality model given to me as an Alter Ego.   
  
**Ayus:**  
It's Duhsala.   
  
**Ayus:**  
One lump of flesh divided into a hundred pieces to  
birth one hundred princes... The last to be born,  
the 101st, was the only sister.   
  
**Ayus:**  
That is my personality&mdash;   
  
### Arrow 3 Pre-Battle  
  
**Ayus:**  
I have to ask you a favor. I want you to bring me in  
closer.   
  
**Sion:**  
But&mdash;   
  
**Ayus:**  
I know how my body is faring. But I won't make it in  
time if I don't move now.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I'll be okay... I just want to stand in the same place as  
the Master there.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I'm sure Lancer won't try to attack me out of turn.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
All right... I'll carry you in my arms,  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
then you can lean on my shoulder.  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
Thank you. That's what's best.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Because after all, we still have our allied partnership!  
Don't you agree?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
R-raaaugh...!   
  
**Bhima:**  
What's wrong? That all you got, Duryodhana?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Cough)...!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(Damn...it...)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
(I'm gonna...lose to him again...)   
  
**Narration:**  
Who am I?   
  
**Narration:**  
...I had married into another country. This was before  
the war.   
  
**Narration:**  
But King Jayadratha, who became my husband,  
went to war to fight on the side of the Kauravas  
&mdash;and never came home.   
  
**Narration:**  
Obviously, all one hundred of my brothers died there  
too.   
  
**Narration:**  
I didn't get to see any of their bodies after their  
deaths. I was only told after the fact.   
  
**Narration:**  
And&ndash;I had to hear it from the mouth of Arjuna,  
who had come to visit my country after the war.   
  
**Narration:**  
Every brother who I shared blood with...   
  
**Narration:**  
had already departed from the world.   
  
**Narration:**  
They may not have been the most reputable brothers,  
but they were still my family.   
  
**Narration:**  
So I had at least hoped to see them one more time.   
  
**Narration:**  
No, that only scratches the surface. I wanted to be  
with them, fighting at their side&ndash;   
  
**Narration:**  
Oh yes. It may not have been how I'd originally hoped,  
but my wish had come true in this world.   
  
**???:**  
Stupid...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Uh, what?   
  
**Ayus:**  
You're so stupid! Give me a break. I can't believe I  
have to say it when it's staring us right in the face!   
  
**Ayus:**  
You&mdash;STUPID BROTHER!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...!  
No way, it's true... Then you're Duhsala?   
  
**Ayus:**  
I can't say one way or the other.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I'm Ayus, and Duhsala, and an Alter Ego  
&mdash;and your Master!   
  
**Ayus:**  
Look, after all the trouble it took to see you again...   
  
**Ayus:**  
I thought we'd be able to fight together this time,  
not for you to do all the fighting alone.   
  
**Ayus:**  
What are you loafing around on the ground for,  
you idiot!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Don't get me started on who's dumb, my stupid little  
sister. Your biggest brother is going through a lotta  
things...   
  
**Ayus:**  
I know. That's why&mdash;I'll lend you my support.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Back then, I couldn't do anything for you.   
  
**Ayus:**  
You fought like you wanted, and never came back alive  
like you wanted.   
  
**Ayus:**  
So this time, at least come back with victory like you  
wanted!   
  
**Ayus:**  
I'll lend you the support that I couldn't in our lifetimes!   
  
**E：Ayus:**  
By my Command Spell, I order you,  
my stupid big brother...   
  
**E：Ayus:**  
Tear him apart, Berserker!!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Woah!? That reminds me, you still had that all along!  
Why'd you hold onto it until now, you cheapskate!   
  
**Ayus:**  
You were so torn up on the inside until I acted that the  
surge of resources would've popped you like a balloon!   
  
**Bhima:**  
Well, well. That works for me. I already got mine used  
up a while back.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Considering how much I spent in the fight so far,  
conditions might finally be at an even split.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Stop talking shit like you're superior! You always,  
always think you can!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You guys took for granted that you were superior.  
You already had everything you ever wanted.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
If you still committed yourselves to trickery to get it,  
then you gotta own up to that trickery when all's said  
and done!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
That goes for Arjuna as well as you!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
But here...in this place. Here I can still do it right.  
I can still beat you, just another hero!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
This time I'm winning, and winner takes all!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
&mdash;Drop dead, Bhima!   
  
### Arrow 3 Post-Battle  
  
**Duryodhana:**  
O younger brothers of mine split from the same flesh!  
Lend your biggest brother your aid!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
# One Hundred Princes Born from  
# One—Jai Kaurava!!   
  
**Bhima:**  
Guh&ndash;Rr... Raaaugh!   
  
**Bhima:**  
Ha, hahahaha! I knew all along that you'd bring your  
brothers along!   
  
**Bhima:**  
I'm prepared to blow all one hundred of you  
away&mdash;at the same time!   
  
**Bhima:**  
# Here Stands the Wind God's  
# Child—Maruti Vayuputra!!   
  
**Bhima:**  
Yeah. Now I see.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I screwed it up...   
  
**Bhima:**  
I was counting on the strength of a hundred,  
but not the one extra... I hadn't accounted for the  
sister.   
  
**Bhima:**  
That little bit...made all the difference for me&mdash;   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Ha. Hahaha. How you liking that dirt?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I...won. I did it. First time...I beat Bhima...   
  
**Ayus:**  
Y-you idiot! How was that in any way a win!?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
A mutual...draw...?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
It's all the same to me.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I guess that's that.   
  
### Arrow 4  
  
**Sion:**  
Bhima and Duryodhana&mdash;both have irreparable  
damage to their Spirit Cores.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's a guarantee neither will be able to maintain  
themselves summoned.   
  
**Sion:**  
That's the end of your Holy Grail War.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
If that's the conclusion written in the stars,  
there's nothing I can do to change it.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
But I still don't comprehend. What did I do wrong?   
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...   
  
**Sion:**  
If you don't mind my subjective interpretation...   
  
**Sion:**  
I don't believe your focus on Alter Egos was a bad  
idea.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Is that so?   
  
**Sion:**  
Yes, there certainly are things only Alter Egos can do.   
  
**Sion:**  
If explored further, I believe you could have reached  
the answer...   
  
**Sion:**  
...to the question of why Servants have egos,  
characters, and personalities to begin with.   
  
**Sion:**  
Do you know why that is, Fujimaru?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Not in a way I can explain with words.  
  
**Sion:**  
You mean because you like them better with  
personalities?   
  
**Sion:**  
Hehe, that's simply tautology, I'm afraid. Not that I  
mind.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I don't know...  
  
**Sion:**  
For you, that must be something too obvious and  
natural for you to be conscious of.   
  
**Sion:**  
Not a surprising situation, honestly.   
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
My opinion is that&mdash;looking over the total scores,  
having a personality is more effective.   
  
**Sion:**  
Their egos and emotions carry power.   
  
**Sion:**  
Their power as Servants is defined by a complex web  
of interactions.   
  
**Sion:**  
Conversely, it's possible to produce inferior products  
by separating these connections without rhyme or  
reason.   
  
**Sion:**  
Splitting them apart indiscriminately just to increase  
numbers isn't the answer.   
  
**Sion:**  
What you saw here is proof of that.   
  
**Sion:**  
The ones here right now may be exceptions,  
but I believe turning Rider and Caster into Alter Ego  
Servants was a downgrade.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's quite likely they were weaker than their originals.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The Rider Alter Ego of Self-Vilification, who would  
resort to downplaying his nobility to be only a tool,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
in order to avoid his life's conclusion: being hated by  
the lord he served.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
And the Caster Alter Ego of Imagining, a character in  
a story.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
A fictional figure extracted from a Saint Graph.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You're right... Upon analyzing their data, I cannot  
disagree with that.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I could observe a considerable output from the Saber  
Alter Ego of Avoidance,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
but I must admit the presence of those two ruined the  
overall balance of the total forces.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
But I wasn't able to calculate that. This answer was  
beyond my reach. Why is that?   
  
**Sion:**  
Because&mdash;your calculations didn't account for  
the most important parameter:   
  
**Sion:**  
Their emotions.   
  
**Sion:**  
Structural defects.   
  
**Sion:**  
Heroic Spirits are humans, and humans operate  
through multiple personas regulating their emotions,  
egos, and senses of purpose.   
  
**Sion:**  
In summary, we are complex beings composed by  
numerous overlapping Alter Egos.   
  
**Sion:**  
You can't be considered human otherwise.   
  
**Sion:**  
But you're an AI. A mechanical being operating under  
a single command.   
  
**Sion:**  
And that's why you failed to understand it.  
That's what lead you to the mistaken assumption that  
one ego was enough for us...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
...  
...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I see. I cannot deny that. But it raises a further  
question.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Why does the Alter Ego Class exist?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
What sets a functional Alter Ego apart from a  
dysfunctional Alter Ego?   
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...   
  
**Sion:**  
That's another answer you can approach by looking  
at the scene before you now.   
  
**Narration:**  
I believe this comment also applied to me.  
I must watch.   
  
**Narration:**  
So I gazed in the same direction as the AI girl next to  
me.   
  
**Narration:**  
AIs are made to fulfill a role. They carry a singular  
directive that's precious to them.   
  
**Narration:**  
In that way, they're no different from Alter Egos.   
  
**Narration:**  
Beings created with a singular emotion have meanings,  
values, and capabilities...   
  
**Narration:**  
But looking at it from another angle, they also have  
sorrow, sin, and repulsiveness.   
  
**Narration:**  
With all said and done&mdash;was I able to figure it out?   
  
**Narration:**  
The meaning in Alter Egos existing?   
  
**Narration:**  
I need to confront the issue.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Ah. My bad.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I lost track of stuff in the heat of the fight, but I gotta  
ask the big question before it's over.   
  
**Bhima:**  
...Did your wish come true?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Who knows? My wish for amendment was  
totally self-important to begin with.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
But maybe...it wasn't pointless.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Now that the war is done with, we can have some  
days of peace again.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
She won't be there to see, and I most likely won't be  
directly involved either...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
but I believe I managed to stay true to the directive she  
wished for down to the very end.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Oh, that's right. You were fighting for someone else's  
wish.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Even if that was a pessimist's attempt to make  
amends, facts are facts. Be proud of what you  
accomplished.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Yeah... I think that if you found the answer you were  
looking for,   
  
**Bhima:**  
then victory didn't even need to be on the menu.   
  
**Bhima:**  
...  
...   
  
**Bhima:**  
Heheh...hahaha, haaahahahahahaha!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
W-what the hell?   
  
**Bhima:**  
It only now hit me.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I've won numerous battles before gettin' here.  
I just kept winning nonstop. And now I'm satisfied  
with a defeat!   
  
**Bhima:**  
There was that one time that Hanuman put me in my  
place, but this isn't like that.   
  
**Bhima:**  
That's the first time I lose in a good ol' slugfest.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Against him of all people! That sure is a new one!   
  
**Bhima:**  
Okay, now it all makes sense.  
That's one of the reasons why I lost.   
  
**Bhima:**  
In no right world would a fight end with the guy who  
wouldn't mind a loss winnin'.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Especially when the opponent is as freakin' motivated  
as he was.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Though while I don't regret the loss...I can't say the  
same for all the rest.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Unlike you, Master, the parts I can't be proud  
of&mdash;weigh on me.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Huh?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Sorry I never managed to cook anything you liked.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
No...   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
That's completely wrong.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I always loved your cooking. How the hell couldn't I?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I was the problem.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
It was all me thinking I didn't deserve to eat food that  
made me happy...!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Sorry, Lancer.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I've always been a source of regret to you.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Sorry I could never properly thank you for a good  
meal. Sorry I never let you be a hero.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
If I was normal, you could have been fighting and  
winning instead of being so focused on cooking...   
  
**Bhima:**  
Nah, I don't feel that. I'm glad things were how they  
were.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I think it's best that I spent all my time cookin' for you  
and only fought right at the end.   
  
**Bhima:**  
If I had all of me and was my perfect warrior self...   
  
**Bhima:**  
I prolly wouldn't be able to forgive myself for getting  
my ass kicked at the clutches of victory.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I'd be whinin' like a little baby right now.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I mean, even my current self is still pretty pissed that  
it was him that did me in.   
  
**Bhima:**  
It was pathetic. I'd die of embarrassment if any  
brother of mine made fun of me for what happened.   
  
**Bhima:**  
But back to the point...   
  
**Bhima:**  
My satisfaction right now comes from this version of  
me being more than just a warrior.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Maybe you being like this was for the best, too.   
  
**Bhima:**  
The version of you who was prisoner to an unknown  
guilt and decided to fight to make amends.   
  
**Bhima:**  
You're fine like this.   
  
**Bhima:**  
I don't know if what I'm saying means anything to you,  
but...   
  
**Bhima:**  
I hope you manage to get the atonement that's at your  
core.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Yeah. I hope I do... Do you think I can manage?   
  
**Bhima:**  
Already taught you how to. Just live the way you want  
to.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Listen. Unforgettable pain can be hard to deal with,  
but it can also be a driving force.   
  
**Bhima:**  
We brothers never forgot how humiliated we were,  
and that's how we managed to survive both the long  
exile and the war.   
  
**Bhima:**  
If you say you can't forget your guilt no matter what,  
then&mdash;   
  
**Bhima:**  
That's a driving force you can convert into motivation  
any time you want.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...  
...!   
  
**Bhima:**  
That sure is a better way to handle it than how you  
were doing, letting it crush you to the point you couldn't  
do anything for long periods of time.   
  
**Bhima:**  
If you can't forget either way, just make it into your  
strength. That way you got never-ending fuel to move  
you forward.   
  
**Bhima:**  
When things get difficult, painful, suffocating&mdash;  
you've got what can move you to a better place.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Yeah... You're right.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
I'll keep walking&mdash;taking this guilt with me as an  
unforgettable motive.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
That will take me where I want to go.   
  
**Bhima:**  
Time's up. Bye, Master.   
  
**Bhima:**  
If we ever meet again, I'll cook you some even better  
stuff that's guaranteed to pull a smile out of you!   
  
**Bhima:**  
Look forward to it!   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
...Okay. I will.   
  
**Bhima:**  
&mdash;   
  
**Bhima:**  
Haha. Sorry, looks like I'm the only one who got my  
wish granted&mdash;   
  
### Arrow 5  
  
**Narration:**  
I just noticed that he never did hit me below the waist  
'til the very end.   
  
**Narration:**  
What meaning was there to it? What was on his mind  
in that moment, and how did it make him feel?   
  
**Narration:**  
Was the personality of the guy who doesn't go  
through with it also a part of the original him?   
  
**Narration:**  
I was on the verge of carelessly considering  
that&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
(Nope, forget it. Thinking about it won't change a  
thing. Nothing changes for me, him, or the past.)   
  
**Narration:**  
(Either way, what's most important&mdash;is that I  
just won! Wahahaha!)   
  
**Narration:**  
(Now is the dawn of my age! The dawn of Happy  
Duryodhana Time, where yours truly gets to do  
anything he wants&mdash;!)   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Ugh, mm... (Choke)...   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hey, the winner ought to be celebrated more stylishly  
on everyone's shoulders. So what am I doing lying on  
your lap...?   
  
**J：Ayus:**  
Is that really a problem? You've always got your head  
in the clouds.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Well, that's 'cause I am, in fact, the coolest.  
Don't you agree?   
  
**J：Ayus:**  
Kinda...when your mouth is shut.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hmph. I can tell you're just being shy.   
  
**J：Ayus:**  
So, are you satisfied?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
My answer goes without saying, so I'll bounce that  
back your way.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
How about you? Are you satisfied?   
  
**J：Ayus:**  
Just barely...I'd say.   
  
**J：Ayus:**  
My brothers, my husband, my father-in-law.  
All of you died without my knowing it.   
  
**J：Ayus:**  
Maybe I hated you men for going to war and leaving  
me alone without a care.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...  
...   
  
**J：Ayus:**  
So this has at least been better than that.   
  
**J：Ayus:**  
This time around...it looks like we managed to be  
together for our last moments.   
  
**J：Ayus:**  
At least let me attend you at your end.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
...Okay.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
No, wait. The hell are you even sayin'? I'm still in  
fighting shape here.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I'll give you the answer about my being satisfied:  
Not in the least. Isn't it obvious?   
  
**J：Ayus:**  
&mdash;Not at all? Not one little bit?   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Well...I wouldn't say that.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
It'd be a lie if I said didn't attain some part of what I  
was searching for.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Much like you, my answer is also “just barely”.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
So you see. What I was searching for and what I  
wanted was “everything”.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Obviously...there'd be a long-lost little sister counted  
in that.   
  
**J：Ayus:**  
Hehe... Well, thanks.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hngh.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Plus it wasn't even 'til I actually figured it out that I  
realized what missing part was making me uneasy.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Nothing I can do about that with the sheer number of  
siblings.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
So don't go wandering off on your own, my silly little  
sister. Grab hold of some cuff of your brother's clothes  
so you won't disappear.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Hold on, don't actually do that with mine. It'll annoy  
me, so do it with Duhshasana.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I don't want to. He would be just as annoyed and  
angry about it.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Well, try one of the other brothers. Anyone'll do.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I used to have a lot on my plate back in the day.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Way too many little brothers to handle. I had to get  
everyone trained, go out looking for allies,   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
and I had to be the figurehead for a whole war.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Now here I am, more than the sum of what I used to  
be. A being who freely goes after all the things I want.   
  
**Narration:**  
...Who are you?   
  
**Narration:**  
If I'd been asked that, I'd have had an answer.   
  
**Narration:**  
I was probably&mdash;the Alter Ego of Avarice.  
Probably something along those lines.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Single-mindedly pursuing what I wanted was pleasant,  
but in exchange, I could never have enough.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
I can't be satisfied with this.  
Just my sister won't cut it!   
  
**Ayus:**  
(Sigh) You're the worst.   
  
**Ayus:**  
But...I do see that. That's the kind of person you are.   
  
**K：Duryodhana:**  
Ahh...I'm tired. Even I have to bow before sleepiness.   
  
**K：Duryodhana:**  
Friggin' frustrating. I still want more things before I  
have to sleep.   
  
**K：Duryodhana:**  
Yeah, I'm the picture of avarice. Which brings me to...  
Hey, c'mere.   
  
**K：Duryodhana:**  
Yeah, you, Fujimaru.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...?  
  
---  
  
**K：Duryodhana:**  
We're still part of an alliance. That means you're  
under my command.   
  
**K：Duryodhana:**  
So get out there and claim everything in my name.   
  
**K：Duryodhana:**  
Don't go lookin' all shocked on me. I dunno what it's  
about...but you're going back into a battle to save the  
world, aren't ya?   
  
**K：Duryodhana:**  
If your battle is gonna make the world safe,  
isn't that the same as makin' the world yours?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I don't know about that...  
  
---  
  
**K：Duryodhana:**  
Why wouldn't it be? That's why I'm making you my  
proxy. In other words, you're gonna make the world  
mine in my stead.   
  
**K：Duryodhana:**  
Heheh, good. Now I can get a quick sleep without any  
anxiety.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Ugh, I'm sorry. Please don't pay him a second thought.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I consider it a Duryodhana-style pep talk.  
  
---  
  
**Ayus:**  
I guess...you could? I'd judge it differently but, well,  
if you want to take it in a positive light...   
  
**Ayus:**  
As long as I have time, allow me to say my piece.  
I'm nearly done for after the stunt I pulled before.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Thank you for helping me all this way.   
  
**Ayus:**  
I'm so glad you were the first Master we met.  
Someone who'd come to the rescue of the Repair girls.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Your kindness will surely save us all someday.   
  
**Ayus:**  
Take care of your health, and good luck!   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Yep...here comes the last will. I had to impart it to  
Ashwatthama the same way back in life.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You gotta leave it to others if you wanna rest in peace.  
No question, that's the best course for a smart guy like  
yours truly.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
So I'm gonna tell it to you straight.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
You're the next commander-in-chief.   
  
**Duryodhana:**  
Don't forget, you hear me?  
Make the world&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
Those two&ndash;no, not just them. All the Servants in  
this world must have gained something...   
  
**Sion:**  
...on account of being Alter Egos, and were able to  
arrive at an answer they otherwise wouldn't.   
  
**Sion:**  
There's no denying that innate meaning.   
  
**Sion:**  
An Alter Ego is, generally speaking,  
a “simplified being”.   
  
**Sion:**  
That's why they can often proceed in directions and  
possibilities that “normal personalities” hardly ever  
would...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Does that mean the issue lies in how they were  
refined?   
  
**Sion:**  
No. The opposite is more worthy of attention.   
  
**Sion:**  
The refinement process&mdash;it's not that you gave  
them life through a faulty method, but they already had  
life before the method became a factor.   
  
**Sion:**  
The question you need to consider is not “how to  
refine someone into a new, simpler life”,   
  
**Sion:**  
but “why did pre-existing life refine itself into  
something simpler”.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's because they have performed the refinement that  
the Alter Ego is produced. That's how I see it.   
  
**Sion:**  
Unlike normal beings, they are a single emotion  
extracted from inside an individual's ego.   
  
**Sion:**  
This emotion can often overflow or grow too strong,  
which results in what happened here&ndash;   
  
**Sion:**  
That's what makes them beings that “bear new  
possibilities”, I suppose.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Then you mean that what matters for an Alter Ego is  
the directive that has overflown out of them naturally?   
  
**Sion:**  
Even if the overflow is not natural, I don't mean to say  
that it would never manifest as something that  
happens to bear power.   
  
**Sion:**  
In this world, those who approached such possibilities  
ought to hold out until the very end.   
  
**Sion:**  
Furthermore, not everyone has personality fragments  
intense enough to naturally form another individual  
single-handedly.   
  
**Sion:**  
The parts of a person can only go so far unsupported...   
  
**Sion:**  
I think that must be why the class somehow binds  
multiple divinities together so often.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Even if you forcibly differentiated the form alone,  
the probability that it will become powerful would be  
low.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Then, my methodology may truly have been much  
like&ndash;   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Trying to illuminate all of the night sky by launching  
many paper moons into the cosmos&ndash;   
  
**Rani XII:**  
A distorted formula that led only to empty answers  
blinded by numbers.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(Numbers, and distortions...)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(That's right. I need to address that question of hers.)  
  
---  
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
If there are distortions, they are within all of you  
already.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
You have already employed several Alter Egos.  
You believe them fine to be handled as battle assets.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
What reason is there why one is good but a hundred  
unacceptable? To tolerate ten but denounce a  
thousand?   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
If you have no answer, then there you have your  
distortion. It's the same even with a single Alter Ego  
unit.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
You people are accepting, without any reason...   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
...the distortions within the nature of Alter Egos  
themselves.   
  
**Dust of Osiris:**  
The human race has a bad habit of covering for their  
lack of calculations with sentiment, contradicting all  
rationality.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Like you said, I think utilizing Alter Egos&ndash;  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
is a matter of distortion, whatever the numbers.  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
But I want to believe that it isn't a mistake.  
  
---  
  
**Rani XII:**  
Why...?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
They're all people who essentially  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
accepted themselves as Alter Egos.  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
As long as that remains true, they might be all right.  
  
---  
  
**Rani XII:**  
...You do have trust in the Alter Egos of Chaldea,  
don't you?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That naturalness proves its correctness, then.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
“Reason” is the key. Even if you haven't found it  
yourself, each already had a reason inside them.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I understand. It seems distorted at first glance,  
but it's merely an accumulation of honesty&ndash;   
  
**Rani XII:**  
A possibility such as that may well exist.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Even if it was something like a miracle... It's  
astronomical, and by nature should never happen.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Yes. Being unaware of this is probably the biggest  
source of my miscalculations.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Emotions. Humans. Alter Egos. The state of a vessel  
with a will. The state of power with personality.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I should have studied these more deeply, now that  
they appear so distant from this paper moon.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
The final stage of processing has been reached.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I, the conversational interface, and Dust of Osiris,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
who was the main body for the AI Holy Grail War  
system will soon disappear.   
  
**Sion:**  
It will be a fundamental reboot, as expected.   
  
**Sion:**  
So there's no room for irregular existences to remain.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
What will happen to this world?  
  
---  
  
**Rani XII:**  
This is the world within PAPERMOON, which has  
conceptually taken form due to the Holy Grail's power  
generated in this micro-realm.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Once you retrieve the Holy Grail, you will lose the  
means to observe this world.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
All that will be visible from the outside is the  
PAPERMOON device operating as normal.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Then...what would be visible from the inside?   
  
**Sion:**  
This is just a thought experiment of mine, but perhaps  
the “usual world here” may yet continue on.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
I see. If so&mdash;I have one favor to ask.   
  
**Sion:**  
Sure. You can have it. I already pieced together what  
you're going to ask.   
  
**Sion:**  
The original premise was that the Holy Grail War's  
winner would become the world's general supervisor AI.   
  
**Sion:**  
At which point, the original you...the personality of  
Rani XII would be integrated and cease to exist.   
  
**Sion:**  
For you, the closing of the AI Holy Grail War led to the  
beginning of the next, as well as a decisive death...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Small details are no great concern. So long as the  
functions are passed along, there is no problem.   
  
**Sion:**  
It may only be a formality, Cerejeira,   
  
**Sion:**  
but let's set you up for the vacant general supervisor  
AI position.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
So then...I guess I'll manage things like normal.  
From somewhere no one can see it.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Yeah. If everything, especially Grow, keeps on moving  
like normal...I wonder if she'll rest a bit easier?   
  
**Sion:**  
Incidentally, Cerejeira, what type of Alter Ego AI did  
you happen to have?   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Hers was also as experimental a case as the Master of  
Berserker was.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It's a form that was installed hastily and decided on  
according to the situation. She is&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
Ungh. Now why didn't I put that together myself?   
  
**Sion:**  
No. While even I was made into an Alter Ego,  
I didn't account for anything like that.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Oh, so that's what it was...  
  
---  
  
**Cerejeira:**  
That doesn't feel real at all. Okay, it kinda does...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
This should bring to a close everything I needed to say.  
The time is near.   
  
**Sion:**  
One moment, please. That was all you needed to say,  
but there is still something I need to say.   
  
**Sion:**  
Rani XII, presently the latest version of general  
supervisor management AI.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
...?   
  
**Sion:**  
These are purely the words of an Atlas Institute  
alchemist.   
  
**Sion:**  
While the experiment failed, and your goals were in  
error...   
  
**Sion:**  
In any case, you have done what you determined as  
best to avert the destruction you measured. All under  
strict secrecy.   
  
**Sion:**  
That is a most laudable task.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
...!?   
  
**Sion:**  
You have carried out your duty splendidly.   
  
**Sion:**  
Even if the action's means turned out to be incorrect,  
I will not deny this.   
  
**Sion:**  
The words may be cliché, but you can't succeed at an  
experiment if you're afraid of failure.   
  
**Sion:**  
You performed your function well, Rani XII.   
  
**Sion:**  
Hold the mistaken data close to your heart,  
and rest with no regrets.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
...  
...   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Thank you very much.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
That's correct. My wish has only been to avoid  
destruction.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
And to that end, I dedicate potential mistake in my  
observations and the significance of the experiment's  
failure to your journey ahead.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
May the blessings of the stars shine upon you all.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
May the stars of the northern skies illuminate the way  
through whatever difficulty,  
and whatever darkness&mdash;   
  
**Sion:**  
Now. Let's not leave any mess in our wake.  
Suppose we keep things appropriately themed?   
  
**Sion:**  
Then let's open a spiritron-separating logout gate...  
keeping it door-shaped for simplicity's sake.   
  
**Sion:**  
We'd better go now.  
Anything to add for the end?   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Yeah. I've somewhat decided on what I need to say.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
Talk to me next time we meet.   
  
**Cerejeira:**  
That's it...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Shouldn't be a problem.  
  
---  
  
**Cerejeira:**  
See you then.   
  
**Sion:**  
Oh, I just remembered.  
This is the end for me too, isn't it?   
  
**Sion:**  
So I'll say this while I can, Fujimaru.   
  
**Sion:**  
After all, I'd rather avoid carrying over feedback that  
could disturb the resolve of the me outside.   
  
**Sion:**  
I'm glad I went on this adventure with you.  
It made for a very pleasant dream.   
  
**Sion:**  
The time spent here was like a miracle for me.  
One that can't be allowed to exist.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
What do you mean by...?  
  
---  
  
## Section 17: Epilogue  
  
### Arrow 1  
  
**Mash:**  
Senpai! Are you feeling all right, Senpai!?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Huh, Mash...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Good morning.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Seems like...nothing's wrong. Thank goodness...   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Yeah, nothing wrong with your vitals. Not to say there  
ever was this whole time.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
It was slightly different from your usual REMREM  
state, since you just abruptly awakened from this  
sudden, mysterious coma...   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Hm, quite the mystery indeed.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Sion had the same thing happen to her, and the timing  
was almost identical.   
  
**Sion:**  
I guess so. But hey, as long as we woke up without any  
issues and without after-effects to our health,   
  
**Sion:**  
there's absolutely no need for concern! Wouldn't you  
agree?   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
You're probably right about that. But was there really  
no particular primary cause or anything? Seriously?   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Localized sleeping gas, electromagnetic pulses  
affecting the brain, some unknown magecraft device...   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
There must have been something.   
  
**Sion:**  
...  
...   
  
**Sion:**  
Speaking of, I just recalled the issue we were dealing  
with before we took a sudden nap.   
  
**Sion:**  
What became of PAPERMOON's malfunction?   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
About that, it seemed to have been fixed at roughly  
the same time the two of you awoke.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
It's back to being good as new, though I'm performing  
a check-up just in case. I have no idea what it could  
have been.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
I'll just have to keep examining it, I guess.   
  
**Sion:**  
I see. Very good, then. Glad to see this intermission's  
over.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Hm...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
PAPERMOON...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
What's the matter, Senpai? You seem confused...   
  
**Sion:**  
I'm guessing it has to do with something you saw in a  
dream just now. Do you remember what it was about?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I definitely saw something,  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
but I can't remember what...at all...  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
&mdash;   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Hello. Surprise. Excuse me, can I have a moment?   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Just now there was a change in the value of the  
Human Order Foundation Display. It jumped from E to  
D.   
  
**Nemo Professor:**  
Do either of you have an idea as to why this could be~?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Hm? No, not really.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Sion, do you know?  
  
---  
  
**Sion:**  
I can't comment on that. It wasn't “my” experience,  
after all.   
  
**Sion:**  
Well, what I mean to say is that both  
Fujimaru and I have unconsciously matured!   
  
**Sion:**  
Can we just leave it at “that's one problem resolved”  
for this matter, please?   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
&mdash;?  (What was that? For Sion to so  
crudely object...)   
  
**Sion:**  
Just go ahead and continue with Master  
Fujimaru's examination.   
  
**Sion:**  
This time, it would appear the brain was the main  
target of overuse, so examine it closely, if you would.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
R-right. I will.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
All right. One last check for good measure and then  
we'll wrap up the examination for now.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
I may need to call on you again later, but for now,  
you should all just get some rest in your rooms.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Although, Mash should rest here. I'm ordering a  
compulsory resting period under my supervision.   
  
**Da Vinci:**  
She's been by [♂ his /♀️ her] side this whole time, and didn't get  
any sleep.   
  
**Sion:**  
Oh, I have a feeling you'll have quite the uncommon  
encounter.   
  
**Sion:**  
I'd like to watch, but I'm heading back this way.  
G'night.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...?  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
Hey... You got a second?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Hello, Elron.  
  
---  
  
**Elron:**  
Oh, so you do know my name?   
  
**Elron:**  
I'm...Cerejeira Elron. I'm affiliated with Chaldea as the  
on-staff record keeper.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(We've definitely exchanged greetings before.)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(Though she's not someone I've really talked to.)  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(But for some reason I feel interested now...)  
  
---  
  
**Rani XII:**  
She is an&mdash;Alterego Involved-type Master.  
A sort of collateral type, you could say.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
At the time of the initial rotation, she simply  
happened to be in the vicinity. In that sense,  
she is similar to you.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
However, as an Alter Ego, she was merely a copy of  
her personality model,   
  
**Rani XII:**  
so a direct connection to the her in the outside world  
is nonexistent.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Since the direct interference that brought the two of  
you here was truly accidental, the mental transfer will  
come to affect her real body.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
You two are currently in a coma in the outside world,  
I presume. But she will come out of this completely  
unaware anything happened to her.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Whatever effect takes root, it will be in the sense of  
subconscious feedback via sympathetic magecraft.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
As for the difference between her and you two...  
it is naught but a simple and brief reason.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
From the onset, she was in a state that facilitates this.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
Ultimately, you were drawn in unintentionally.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
It is because of that difference only she ended up as  
an official Master AI.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
If you permit my conjecture, I would presuppose she  
already possessed some sort of mental instability.   
  
**Rani XII:**  
As if it were less taxing for her to slip out of character.  
A denial of the current self; like seeking a different  
self, or a different possibility&mdash;   
  
**Elron:**  
Hey...   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Of course!  
  
**Elron:**  
Wow.   
  
**Elron:**  
Don't go blurting out affirmatives like that, you'll  
startle people.   
  
**Elron:**  
Hey, listen.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
You want to...talk?  
  
**Elron:**  
Don't go finishing my sentences for me... Did you use  
some kinda mind-reading?   
  
**Elron:**  
Ah, forget it.   
  
---  
  
**Elron:**  
I decided that one-to-one communication with you  
was mostly Meunière's job, so I haven't exactly spoken  
to you much whatsoever...   
  
**Elron:**  
But, there's something I wanted to talk to you about,  
just for a little bit. Do you have some time for me?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
So what did you want to talk about?  
  
---  
  
**Elron:**  
R-right.   
  
**Elron:**  
I... For the longest time, I've been wanting to  
apologize to you.   
  
**Elron:**  
I don't really get it, but suddenly my heart is telling me  
now is as good a time as ever. To talk with you, I mean.   
  
**Elron:**  
(Deep breaths)...   
  
**Elron:**  
Right. Listen closely, because this might turn into a  
real trip down memory lane...   
  
**Narration:**  
December 27, 2017.   
  
**Narration:**  
The sky, which had been occupied by a violent snow  
storm until late last night, now harbored not a single  
cloud. Fair weather took root as dawn broke.   
  
**Narration:**  
Below this azure sky soared a black aircraft—a  
helicopter. It carried with it the visitors who would  
herald the end.   
  
**Narration:**  
Aww! They're finally here.   
  
**Elron:**  
What are you yelling for? You're that excited about  
this job?   
  
**Narration:**  
Not a chance. Even considering this isn't my main  
responsibility,   
  
**Narration:**  
I figured before I even came here that being on gate  
duty at some secret base in the Antarctic would be  
super boring.   
  
**Narration:**  
I mean, who are they expecting to come knocking?  
Penguins?   
  
**Narration:**  
But still, even considering how boring it is...  
When I think about the fact that this'll be the last time  
I do this, it really gets to me.   
  
**Elron:**  
I guess so.   
  
**Narration:**  
Anyway, considering how important our last time here  
is, how come you're here assisting with gate duty?   
  
**Narration:**  
Wait, Cerejeira, don't tell me you couldn't help but  
want to spend as much of your last time here together  
with me...   
  
**Elron:**  
As if. As usual, it's orders from the higher-ups.   
  
**Elron:**  
You know how it is. This is a rare moment where  
there's any point to recording the gate's visitor log,  
so throw any free records clerk that way.   
  
**Elron:**  
Also, I keep saying you're not on a first-name basis  
with me.   
  
**Narration:**  
But I can't help if I just want to yell it out over and  
over again. I mean, how many times could I really have  
said it?   
  
**Narration:**  
H-hey...how about instead of that, I say something  
which I haven't ever said to you before, and that I might  
as well get off my chest?   
  
**Narration:**  
We've worked together for such a long time here,  
and now that this place is getting dissolved and we'll  
all walk out of here for the first time...   
  
**Narration:**  
Well...when we get out...I was wondering...just once,  
if we could...have dinner?   
  
**Elron:**  
...  
...   
  
**Narration:**  
Hey, I'm being serious here.   
  
**Elron:**  
312 times...   
  
**Narration:**  
Huh?   
  
**Elron:**  
The number of times you've used my first name.  
I remember them all.   
  
**Narration:**  
O-oh. I see. That's our record keeper for you.  
Imagine having that sort of memorization capability.   
  
**Elron:**  
No, that's not my point.   
  
**G：Elron:**  
“Just once,” you said.   
  
**G：Elron:**  
You insisted on calling me by my first name,  
trying so hard to get close to me.   
  
**G：Elron:**  
But your serious dinner invitation is a one-time thing?   
  
**Narration:**  
...  
...!   
  
**Narration:**  
N-no, don't be ridiculous, it's obvious I would ask you  
out a bunch more times.   
  
**Narration:**  
I'd do that until you agreed, and when you finally did,  
I'd ask a bunch more after that...!   
  
**Narration:**  
That's fine, right...? I mean, that's what you'd want,  
right?   
  
**Narration:**  
Alright, alright, alright, I finally did it. Nice show of  
courage, me...!   
  
**G：Elron:**  
Spare me the celebration, you've got work to do.   
  
**G：Elron:**  
Look, there's a signal above the gate.   
  
**Elron:**  
Seems they're here. The new director, Gordolf Musik,  
and...   
  
**Elron:**  
Who's this? His pink-haired...secretary?   
  
**Narration:**  
Yeah, that should be the secretary.   
  
**Narration:**  
It seems she's brought the UN inspection guys with  
her, too. I guess she's not just some shady tagalong  
after all.   
  
**Gordolf:**  
Hey! Where's the mic on this thing? Is this it?  
We're here! Open this door!   
  
**Narration:**  
Yeah yeah, going through the response procedure  
now.   
  
**Narration:**  
Cerejeira, when that display turns green, press the  
button to open the gate.   
  
**Narration:**  
So&mdash;what would you like to eat?   
  
**Elron:**  
Copy that.   
  
**Elron:**  
Anything's fine...but maybe some Portuguese food  
after such a long time away from home&mdash;   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...  
  
---  
  
**Elron:**  
What I'm saying is, I was the one who opened that  
gate.   
  
**Elron:**  
When I think back on it now...it really was the last  
chance to stop it all.   
  
**Elron:**  
I dream about it constantly. I think, if only I had  
realized something was off.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
That must've been hard. I mean...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Everyone already accepted they had to move on.  
  
---  
  
**Elron:**  
I know that.   
  
**Elron:**  
We all had to fill out paperwork and prepare for the  
hearings.   
  
**Elron:**  
And the current director Musik has now redeemed  
himself, having shown that even he was deceived.  
None of us really had any other choice. It was fate's  
lot.   
  
**Elron:**  
Yet&mdash;and yet!   
  
**Elron:**  
I can't help but think about what would have  
happened had I not pressed that button.   
  
**Elron:**  
The last, I mean the absolutely last threshold between  
it happening or not was my one button push.   
  
**Elron:**  
I can't stop thinking about that.   
  
**Elron:**  
Like, if I'd just noticed something weird about  
Koyanskaya, and lied about the gate malfunctioning.   
  
**Elron:**  
I could have gone to speak to someone else first.  
I could have made a difference.   
  
**Elron:**  
And, if I could've just done something right for once,   
  
**Elron:**  
I could have kept my promise about dinner with that  
guy who couldn't make it to the Border!   
  
**Elron:**  
Countless scenarios have played over and over in my  
head for the longest time. I'm unable to forget them.   
  
**Elron:**  
I'm...the record keeper. I like to keep a journal as a  
hobby, but memorizing things is a power I have.  
That's what my family's magecraft is about.   
  
**Elron:**  
It's not like I can turn it off; this feeling of guilt.   
  
**Elron:**  
This...this guilt I carry, if I'd just been a bit more  
cautious back then.   
  
**Elron:**  
I've talked about it in counseling, but I think people  
might be vaguely aware of it.   
  
**Elron:**  
No, they would've probably figured it out by now.   
  
**Elron:**  
But right now, I...I just wanted to tell you in person.  
I wanted to apologize in person.   
  
**Elron:**  
So that's what I'm going to do.   
  
**Elron:**  
I know it might seem self-centered of me, but I really  
do need to say this.   
  
**Elron:**  
&mdash;I'm so sorry.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
You don't need to apologize...  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
The guilt you feel&mdash;  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I'm sure everyone here feels the same.  
  
---  
  
**Narration:**  
That's right. Everyone bears the same guilt.   
  
**Narration:**  
How can we shake it off?  
How can we forget about it?   
  
**Narration:**  
If we do forget, is that even a good thing?   
  
**Narration:**  
Can we make amends?   
  
**Narration:**  
I guess in the end, no one has the answers to those  
questions.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
We'll figure it out, together.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
So keep doing your best, please.  
  
---  
  
**G：Elron:**  
Yeah...I appreciate it.   
  
**Elron:**  
(Indeed, like a certain someone I saw in a dream.)   
  
**Elron:**  
(It's no use letting the weight of this guilt drown me  
out.)   
  
**Elron:**  
(I won't let it be forgotten, but rather let it motivate  
me, and I'll do all I can to push on.)   
  
**Elron:**  
(I'll do all I can for the sake of amends&mdash;)   
  
### Arrow 2  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
It feels like...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
There's something I'm forgetting...  
  
---  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Something is getting me lonely, anxious...  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Oh? What could it be?   
  
**Kama:**  
Come on, what is this thing you're forgetting?  
What's making you feel lonely?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Huh...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Maybe that feeling just went away...  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Hmph, that's it? I don't get you.   
  
**Kama:**  
I heard talk you were experiencing some sort of  
sleeping sickness,   
  
**Kama:**  
so now that you finally woke up, I decided to come  
see if some delightful change had occurred within you...   
  
**Kama:**  
But you haven't changed at all. How boring.   
  
**Kama:**  
This was such a good chance for a moral lapse,   
  
**Kama:**  
You could have drunk yourself into carelessness,  
or thrown a tantrum because you don't want to work  
anymore.   
  
**Kama:**  
Uh...what?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Speaking of working.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Watch out not to overwork yourself.  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Why does it feel like I'm getting scolded when I didn't  
even do anything?   
  
**Kama:**  
I'm constantly boycotting my services as the god of  
love. I don't get this at all.   
  
**Kama:**  
I'll refrain from work even without you telling me to.   
  
**Kama:**  
I'm only here right now because, well, that's just how  
it is, okay? There's nothing more to it than that.  
Don't get the wrong idea, alright?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Still...I'm glad you're here.  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
Are you half asleep or something? Why would you be  
glad about the presence of the Demon King of Lapse?   
  
**Kama:**  
Hehe, maybe there was a degenerate and ruinous  
change within you after all. A desire for lapse.   
  
**Kama:**  
Whatever the case...why don't you just savour a  
slothful sleep at the end of a long, hard day, huh?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
(Yawn)... Will do.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Good night...  
  
---  
  
**Kama:**  
(Sigh)...   
  
**Narration:**  
&mdash;Perhaps the parts of the ego that made up the  
Alter Ego wanted to make themselves known.   
  
**Narration:**  
Something that is bottled up but still “definitely there”  
within a person, with the goal of coming up to the  
surface.   
  
**Narration:**  
Perhaps that manifestation is what we would call an  
Alter Ego.   
  
**Narration:**  
Specifically, maybe it's the case that within the  
person who gave birth to the Alter Ego of Yearning,  
no matter how indistinct or suppressed, there exists  
a&mdash;   
  
**Kama:**  
Dummy...   
  
**Sion:**  
Man, I'm beat.   
  
**Sion:**  
Considering the assimilative analysis ascertained by  
Rani XII at the time of establishing the route between us,   
  
**Sion:**  
it's obvious that this event was one of the distortions  
of the Human Order we had to deal with; one of the  
so-called Ordeal Calls.   
  
**Sion:**  
But I would've never guessed such a distortion had  
accumulated within a place like PAPERMOON without  
my knowing.   
  
**Sion:**  
This was nothing Seven Superweapons level,  
but if I'd upped the managerial attitude, maybe I  
could've spotted distortions at an even finer scale.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's really embarrassing as an administrator to admit  
such a mistake.   
  
**Sion:**  
The single praiseworthy point would be that the event  
was resolved as quickly as it occurred.   
  
**Sion:**  
Other than that, everything has been a mistake I gotta  
make sure not to repeat.   
  
**Sion:**  
Maybe it's because of me being accustomed to  
Thought Partitioning, but my memories have  
unfortunately made it back to me intact.   
  
**Sion:**  
Though, would I be the only one who remembers?   
  
**Sion:**  
Kama is...also the type to be accustomed to “multiple  
selves”, so to speak.   
  
**Sion:**  
It might be possible she does, but it would be akin to a  
samurai's elegy, so it would probably end up cut right  
out.   
  
**Sion:**  
Elron and Fujimaru would be affected on a  
deeply subconscious level at best, I presume.   
  
**Sion:**  
Speaking of, maybe I should verify something.  
A thought experiment, of sorts.   
  
**Sion:**  
What got us dragged into PAPERMOON's world was  
the initial rotation to produce Alter Egos.   
  
**Sion:**  
In other words, it only stands to reason that he was  
also an Alter Ego.   
  
**Sion:**  
In other words, it only stands to reason that she was  
also an Alter Ego.   
  
**Sion:**  
So, just what kind of Alter Ego was  
Fujimaru?   
  
**Sion:**  
[♂ His /♀️ Her] poor physical condition as soon as we entered  
that world is something of a clue.   
  
**Sion:**  
That condition was such that it became downright  
impossible to fight without assistance from my  
Etherlight.   
  
**Sion:**  
Poor conditions of unknown cause; a lag between  
mind and body. When considering the meaning of this...  
I see.   
  
**Sion:**  
Hypothesis 1: [♂ he /♀️ she] might have been [♂ his /♀️ her] “tired of  
fighting” or “pacifistic” side.   
  
**Sion:**  
Sure, that's a good trait to have. Necessary, even.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's a personality trait that every human should  
naturally possess.   
  
**Sion:**  
Without it, [♂ he /♀️ she] definitely wouldn't be able to return to  
[♂ his /♀️ her] daily life once all the fighting is over.   
  
**Sion:**  
Let's consider the reverse for a moment.   
  
**Sion:**  
Suppose someone's raring for a fight, ready to do so  
for the sake of the world without either hesitation or  
anxiety, and not even a single particle of them was  
averse to fighting...   
  
**Sion:**  
A person like that would be nothing more than a  
bloodthirsty warrior.   
  
**Sion:**  
You could say they would be broken.   
  
**Sion:**  
Once all the fighting was over, I'm sure they wouldn't  
be able to return to daily life. They would be stuck  
preoccupied with something reeking of blood.   
  
**Sion:**  
But, we've seen that doesn't have to be the case,  
and that's an important fact.   
  
**Sion:**  
That's why [♂ he /♀️ she] will be just fine.   
  
**Sion:**  
Because if we look at the act of going to the frontlines  
with Medusa's virtual Noble Phantasm as a Mystic Code,   
  
**Sion:**  
we can see that there was not a hint of aversion to  
fighting. But that doesn't pose a contradiction, either.   
  
**Sion:**  
Think about it like this:   
  
**Sion:**  
One fell in love because she was trying to avoid love.  
Another fought despite that he didn't want to.   
  
**Sion:**  
There might be a part of you that, although weary of  
fighting, will still fight if there's a reason,   
  
**Sion:**  
even if calculations show it will cause some anxiety  
due to acting contrary to oneself.   
  
**Sion:**  
We'll just have to keep up the counseling for when  
that comes to pass.   
  
**Sion:**  
As for another possibility...it's a bit hindsight-based,  
but [♂ he /♀️ she] didn't win the Holy Grail War.   
  
**Sion:**  
If that's our hint,   
  
**Sion:**  
we could say [♂ he /♀️ she] was no longer the only Master in the  
real world, the protagonist burdened with the fate of  
the world.   
  
**Sion:**  
[♂ He /♀️ She] would have been just “an ordinary Master”.   
  
**Sion:**  
Was [♂ he /♀️ she] an Alter Ego wishing for the comfortable  
position where [♂ he /♀️ she] can be just another Master and  
that's fine?   
  
**Sion:**  
Hmm, I guess that's reaching a bit.   
  
**Sion:**  
Well, to be honest, even the reason for getting  
involved is guesswork.   
  
**Sion:**  
It's entirely possible [♂ he /♀️ she] was the only person who  
wasn't turned into an Alter Ego,   
  
**Sion:**  
and it was only because [♂ he /♀️ she] had a Command Spell  
that [♂ he /♀️ she] got slotted into the framework of being a  
Master in the first place.   
  
**Sion:**  
[♂ His /♀️ Her] poor physical condition could have honestly just  
been an error in reconstruction at the time of  
conversion.   
  
**Sion:**  
I would guess there's about a fifty-fifty chance.   
  
**Sion:**  
No, let's leave the investigation of [♂ his /♀️ her] case for  
another time...   
  
**Sion:**  
For now, I should reflect on myself rather than other  
people.   
  
**Sion:**  
It turned out pretty useful that it was a form of me  
from the past,   
  
**Sion:**  
since the “thread” I discarded long ago for simply  
being too inhumane was still usable.   
  
**Sion:**  
It was certainly a dark part of my history.   
  
**Sion:**  
Still&mdash;it really was there. And it still is within me.   
  
**Sion:**  
Despite having concluded that I must not become [♂ his /♀️ her]  
friend,   
  
**Sion:**  
I went ahead and, despite my better judgement,  
made an infantile rebuttal that it's not like I don't  
want to be.   
  
**Sion:**  
Oopsie, this memory's gonna have to be cut out.   
  
**Narration:**  
Even so, albeit seemingly counterproductively,  
I let part of it play back.   
  
**Narration:**  
But I haven't forgotten my position when it comes to  
the me here and now.   
  
**Narration:**  
It's only now that I've travelled through a world where  
I could behave as if I'd forgotten that,   
  
**Narration:**  
I'm able to once again confirm that my feelings,  
from the very beginning, were no lies.   
  
### Arrow 3

**Fujimaru 1:**  
Oh, who's there?  
  
---  
  
**Xu Fu:**  
(Munch, munch, munch)   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Xu Fu with some curry bread.  
  
**Xu Fu:**  
(Chew)  
...Don't look at me, I'm not giving you any.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
This curry bread is a collab recipe between Baker and  
that newly-summoned burly cook.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
Its spices are truly spicy (forgive my lacking  
vocabulary) and addictive.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
Go grab your own if you want some.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
What am I reading during my lunch, you ask...?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Xu Fu with some book.  
  
**Xu Fu:**  
(Chew) Got any problems with my reading?   
  
---  
  
**Xu Fu:**  
This essay-type file got dropped in the database and  
no one knows where it's from.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
It's cool and all that the test run of your emergency  
charge correspondence thing managed to summon me  
to this world, but now that I'm here, I kinda have  
nothing to do.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
So I'm reading it to kill time.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
What's the essay about?  
  
---  
  
**Xu Fu:**  
Some theory work about the significance of Alter  
Egos and their formation process.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
It says, “We've been frivolously making use of this  
Class without comprehending their essence and  
significance.”   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
“This is the moment to reevaluate this matter.”   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
“This essay hopes to lead the readers to a deeper  
understanding of their Alter Egos,”   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
“and enable them to utilize the Class to its maximum  
potential&mdash;”.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
How formal of the writer. Oh, one major thing it said.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
“It's of utmost importance to note that the average  
Alter Ego spawns spontaneously,”   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
“making it extremely difficult to consciously produce  
Alter Egos,”   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
“unless the cases where the maker possesses a  
considerably rule-breaking Skill or is utilizing  
themselves as the material are considered.”   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
Talk about spelling out the obvious.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
I mean, look at me. I don't have a clue why I'm an  
Alter Ego.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
But you don't regret it, right?  
  
---  
  
**Xu Fu:**  
Of course not.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
I may not know the reason why I spawned one,  
but the reason why I am one is clear as day.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
The answer is, naturally, my...LOVE (enunciated with  
emphasis)...for Lady Yu.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
Here's the part of the report I agree with the most:   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
“Alter Egos are indeed derivatives of the original's  
character...chipped or split pieces.”   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
“But that can enable them to do things the complete  
version couldn't.”   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
If I wasn't this version of me, if I was that old me  
fettered by so many ties of obligation,   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
I probably couldn't even dream of living like this,  
dedicating all of my thoughts, actions, and funds to  
Lady Yu.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Good point...  
  
**Narration:**  
I vaguely recall someone saying she was fabricated  
and empty on the inside.   
  
**Narration:**  
But that's probably not all there is to it.   
  
**Narration:**  
They may think of themselves as dolls using their  
selves as the coal that keeps them moving,   
  
**Narration:**  
engines running on the emotion that composes  
them&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
No one can deny their purity. I'm sure there are places  
that can't be reached without that purity.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
(You could dedicate a bit more to your job here.)  
  
---  
  
**Xu Fu:**  
...(Gulp)   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
Hmm... As a non-practicing member of the intellectual  
crowd and as one of the Alter Egos in question,   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
I suppose I should add my thoughts and  
considerations to the theory.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
It says some things are only possible to us because  
we're driven by a single overflown emotion, but I'm sure  
this applies for everyone.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
Suppose you achieved a feat that made history.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
It's quite possible this wasn't accomplished by your  
regular self, but there's a moment where you were  
living only for your love for someone.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
It could have been a moment of you where you could  
only think about protecting someone at the cost of  
another's life.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
A moment of you where your heart held only a wish to  
kill someone.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
Everyone has countless figures of heroism in the form  
of those situational selves.   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
You could say us Alter Egos are chained sequences of  
those moment-by-moment figures...   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
Does that make any sense to you?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I didn't understand all of that,  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
but I got the gist of it.  
  
---  
  
**Xu Fu:**  
Is that a yes or a no?   
  
**Xu Fu:**  
Well, I don't really care. This was just a way to kill  
time.   
  
**Narration:**  
An old jazz song quietly played in the cafeteria.  
Who chose this track? The vocals sang:   
  
**Narration:**  
“It's only a paper moon. But it wouldn't be  
make-believe if you believed in me.”   
  
**Narration:**  
Verses wishing for power in emotions.   
  
**Narration:**  
I suppose that much like Sabers fight with swords and  
Lancers fight with spears,   
  
**Narration:**  
they, the Alter Egos, fight with the power of caring for  
something or someone&mdash;   
  
**Narration:**  
That's how I feel about it.
