# Singularity 1: Hundred Years' War of the Dragons - Orleans  
  
## Prelude  
   
**A：???:**  
&mdash;Heed my words.   
   
**A：???:**  
My will creates your body, and your sword creates my destiny. If you heed the Grail's call, and obey my will and reason, then answer me.   
   
**A：???:**  
I hereby swear. That I shall defeat all evil in the world.   
   
**A：???:**  
But let thine eyes be clouded with the fog of turmoil and chaos. Thou art trapped in a cage of madness, and I the summoner who holds thy chains&ndash;  
   
**A：???:**  
Seventh Heaven clad in the great words of power! Come forth from the circle of binding, Guardian of the Scales&mdash;!   
   
**B：???:**  
Ah!   
   
**A：???:**  
&ndash;Thank you for coming, my fellow Servants. I am your Master.   
   
**A：???:**  
You know why you were summoned, yes? Destruction and slaughter, those are your orders.   
   
**A：???:**  
If a city is reveling in spring, destroy it. If a town is celebrating spring, devastate it.   
   
**A：???:**  
No matter how evil or cruel, God will forgive your every transgression.   
   
**A：???:**  
Should He mete out punishment,that is fine in its own way.   
   
**A：???:**  
For this is no more than a means of proving God's existence and His love.   
   
**A：???:**  
&ndash;Now, then, Gilles. Please bring him here.   
   
**Gilles:**   
As you wish.   
   
**A：???:**  
I trust you have not harmed him, Gilles?   
   
**Gilles:**   
No, of course not. Have you considered what you wish done with him?   
   
**A：???:**  
&mdash;  
   
**Gilles:**   
Oh, my. Do you require suggestions from me?   
   
**A：???:**  
Oh, you have noticed my distress in your infinite concern for me?   
   
**A：???:**  
&mdash;Don't be absurd. If you continue this foolishness, I'll kill you, Gilles.   
   
**A：???:**  
When you are eating a meal, do you think about how you use your fork?   
   
**A：???:**  
This is the same. What I do with him is a matter so trivial it does not merit any thought.   
   
**H：???:**  
...Wh-What's going on? Where am I, and who are you people?   
   
**H：???:**  
Answer me! Are you deaf? You there&mdash;Eep!   
   
**A：???:**  
Oh, Pierre! Bishop Pierre Cauchon! How I have missed you!   
   
**A：???:**  
A day has not gone by when your face has not crossed the mind of Jeanne d'Arc!   
   
**Pierre Cauchon:**   
It can't be. It can't be, it can't be, it can't be, it can't be!   
   
**Pierre Cauchon:**   
Y-Y-Y-You're&ndash;Jeanne d'Arc?! Impossible! This can't be possible!   
   
**Pierre Cauchon:**   
I thought you died three days ago! I thought I killed you! I thought&ndash;  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
"That you should be in Hell? "Perhaps I am, Your Grace.   
   
**Pierre Cauchon:**   
This is a dream. A nightmare. What else could it be but a nightmare!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Oh dear, he's started to flee from reality. This won't do at all. We must snap him out of this.   
   
**Pierre Cauchon:**   
Aiiee! E-E-Eeeee!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
What will you do, Your Grace?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Jeanne d'Arc, whom you accused of heresy, stands here before you.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Should you not grip your crucifix and offer up a prayer to God?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Should you not mock me? Scorn me? Abuse me? Trample me? And tell everyone the wicked Jeanne d'Arc is here!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Should you not roar like the brave lion you are?! Go on, do it! Do it! Do it!   
   
**Pierre Cauchon:**   
Spa&ndash;  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Spa?   
   
**Pierre Cauchon:**   
S-Spare me. Please spare me.   
   
**Pierre Cauchon:**   
I'll do anything. Spare me, I beg of you!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&mdash;Ha ha ha ha ha! Did you hear that, Gilles?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
"Spare me, spare me," he says! This bishop who tied me up, mocked me, and burned me alive!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
As if that were nothing!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
The bishop who told me with kind eyes, that I was going to be killed. Is now begging for his life!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Oh&mdash;The sadness is making me want to cry. After all, that won't save anything.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Your paper-thin faith won't reach the Heavenly Father. Belief that is light as a feather won't blossom anywhere.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Someone who has forsaken God, and clings to his life by begging a witch, is unfit to be called a believer.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Do you understand, Your Grace? You just gave testimony that you are now one of the heretics.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That is why I'm so sad. I think I might laugh until madness consumes me.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Now, think back, Your Grace. You know what sentence awaits heretics, don't you?   
   
**Pierre Cauchon:**   
...  
   
**Pierre Cauchon:**   
N-No, no, no! Spare me...Please, spare me!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I'm so sorry, I'm afraid I ran out of salvation today. Indulgences are not for sale in this era.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Now&mdash;Shall we start at your feet? If I was burned alive by holy flames...  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Then your body shall be scorched by the flames of Hell.   
   
**Pierre Cauchon:**   
Aaaaaiiiiieeeee&ndash;!!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Not even the ashes remain, I see. I apologize for taking up your time, Gilles.   
   
**Gilles:**   
What do you mean? That was a meaningful punishment. Now what should we do with the other clergy.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Good question, it's too much to question them all. Just feed the clergy to them.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Rejoice, my ignoble Servants! The surviving clergy are yours.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I, your Master, Jeanne d'Arc shall forgive you all.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Devour their souls. Feast on their flesh.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Savor their blood. After all, our manifestation is no different than that devil, Dracul.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I have but one order. Wipe out this country, this mistake that is France.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Overrun it, trample it, reap it. Let us begin with our dear Orleans.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
We shall return its fruitful land to a bare wasteland.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Age, gender, and religious beliefs are of no importance. Make sure you kill them equally.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That is the only order I give you as your Master.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
To that end, I have given you all the attributes of a Berserker.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You may be a saint, or a hero, but now you shall dance with your broken soul.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Berserk Saber.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Berserk Archer.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Berserk Lancer.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Berserk Rider.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Berserk Caster.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Berserk Assassin.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
And him, whom I summoned instead of Berserker, and myself.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I shall pass down judgement as this world's Ruler. Humanity has no value, for it failed to prove its love for our Lord.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&mdash;They are guilty to a horrifying extent. Humanity is equally guilty, sinner and saint alike.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
So we shall kill them all. I will not tolerate a single one escaping.   
   
**Gilles:**   
Oh...Oh! Such resolve! Such truth without a slightest doubt!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Such is the saint of salvation! The saint who believes in our Lord, and saves our people!   
   
**Gilles:**   
You have returned...My light has returned...You have truly been reborn, Jeanne!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Then I too, shall rise again as your general! First, we need a symbol...Our army must have a flag!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Jeanne, what shall we use as our emblem? A demon, perhaps? Or what about&mdash;  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
In that case, let's make it a dragon. Be it coincidence or providence, this summoning has brought many with close ties to dragons.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
In the name of dragons, the symbol of catastrophe,we will burn this world to the ground.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Oh, I have one more order. Laugh. As if you are enjoying yourselves from "the bottom of your heart. "  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Heh heh heh. Ah ha ha&ndash;Hahahahaha! Ahahahahahaha!!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Wonderful! This is wonderful, Gilles! I've never enjoyed myself this much in my entire life!   
   
**Gilles:**   
YesYes, I suppose it is. That is the way it should be.   
   
**Gilles:**   
You were put on a pedestal, made a symbol,exploited, and cast aside by the people&mdash;  
   
**Gilles:**   
That is why you are righteous. There is no one who could pass judgment over your heart of hearts!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou? Kyu, fou?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good morning, Fou.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think I just had a bad dream...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Mew, fou! Kyau, kyau!   
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning, Senpai. It's finally time for the briefi&mdash;Eek!   
   
**Fou:**   
Kyuuuuu...  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry, Fou, I couldn't get out of the way. Still, I'm glad to see you so full of energy in the morning.   
   
**Mash:**   
You too, Senpai. Did you sleep well last night?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Like a log.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm glad to hear it. They say it takes talent to get a good night's sleep.   
   
**Mash:**   
I know you just woke up, but it's briefing time. We should hurry.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I didn't get much sleep...  
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh, I forgot you sleep better on the floor or a tatami mat instead of a bed. That was my mistake, I'll make arrangements.   
   
**Mash:**   
Still, the Doctor's briefing is about to start. Let's try to power through the sleepiness.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good morning, Fujimaru. Did you sleep well?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's get right to the briefing, then.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
For starters...Oh right,let me go over what I want you to do again.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
First, the investigation and correction of the singularities. It is humanity's critical turning point in that era.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If it were not for that, we could never have come as far as we have. It is the pivotal "event" in human history.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You must travel to that era, investigate what it is,figure it out, and then correct it.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Otherwise, 2019 will never come. Humanity will be extinct in 2018.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That is your first objective. The basic principle of the upcoming operation.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The operation's second objective is Investigate the "Holy Grail. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is just my speculation, but the singularities must be related to the Holy Grail.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The "Holy Grail" is a relic that can grant wishes. A vessel that contains tremendous amounts of magical energy.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Lev probably got his hands on the Grail in some form, and misused its power.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Rather, it's impossible to travel through time and change the past without the Grail. Seriously.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You will run into intel regarding the Grail during your investigation of the singularity.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even if you correct history, leaving the Grail will put us back to square one.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You must either secure the Holy Grail, or destroy it.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Those are the two objectives of this operation. Is everything clear so far?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Crystal clear.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Glad to hear it.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sorry, could you go over it again?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All right, fine. But pay attention this time, okay?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...And now, there's one other thing I want you to do in addition to the mission.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That said, it's nothing major. It's for after you Rayshift to that era.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I want you to find a leyline and make a summoning circle. Just like you did in Fuyuki.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Unlike Fuyuki, we could probably make do as-is if it's just telepathic communication...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But to transport supplies, it won't work without establishing a summoning circle.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Just like before, once Mash sets up her Noble Phantasm it will act as a catalyst and trigger the summoning circle.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Once you do that, you can summon Servants at will.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Of course, what you summon will probably be Servants closely tied to that time and place.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So keep doing that to bolster your forces. Understood?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Understood. Before all else, we'll try to establish a base camp first.   
   
**Mash:**   
What we'll need is a place to relax, a structure with a roof, a home to come back to. Right, Master?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, I'll be counting on you.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Right. You have a way with words, Mash.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
H-Hearing you say that, really means a lot to me.   
   
**Mash:**   
I know I'm still an inexperienced Servant,but you can count on me. I'll be giving it my all!   
   
**Fou:**   
Kyuu!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Umhm. To see Mash, who's serious, quiet, and frankly,kind of mysterious, grow up to be such a fine lady...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey, get over yourself. How long are you gonna keep me waiting?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oops, you're right. You didn't show any interest so I forgot you were there.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Allow me to introduce you, Fujimaru. He...no, she...er, it? Um, who?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sheesh. Standing there is Chaldea's pride and joy,the head of our Engineering Department, Leonardo.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As you can tell, they are quite unusual. Of course, not a human...Let's not get into that.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The reason being&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
...A Servant. Senpai, this is incredible. This person is a Servant!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Right you are～♪ I'm Chaldea's honorary tech advisor, I normally go by Leonard here.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But as you can see, I am the proud inventor of the Renaissance! The one-and-only Leonardo da Vinci in the flesh!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You can just call me Da Vinci. You don't get to see many pretty ladies like myself around here right?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? Pretty lady?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Da...Vinci?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is strange. It's abnormal. It's wrong! I mean, Leonardo da Vinci should be a man&mdash;  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You should always question conventional wisdom. But, is it really that important?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Who was the first one that claimed I was a man or a woman? Sheesh, for crying out loud.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I pursue beauty with both my inventions and art. It was I who personified all ideals&mdash;all beauty.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
To me, the ideal beauty is the Mona Lisa. That being the case&mdash;See? Isn't this simply an unavoidable result?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I like to think of myself as a scholar, but this guy's pet theories go way over my head.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He's the only pervert twisted enough to turn himself into the Mona Lisa, just because he loves the Mona Lisa.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Heh heh. Are you sure about that, Dr. Roman?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
As cultures mature, anything is possible. The desire to become a beautiful girl might one day be the norm.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That might be true, but which time period's Heroic Spirit are you?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Genius has nothing to do with time period, Doctor. Fujimaru, you'd do well to remember that too.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You will encounter many Heroic Spirits who were artists. Every one of them is as splendid and eccentric!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Are you kidding me? Still, I can see that being the case!   
   
**Mash:**   
I see. It's true that I didn't want to know too much,but thank you for the advice, Da Vinci.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's my girl, you're always so understanding. Ok, that's enough for my introduction.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
From now, I will be focusing on supporting you with supplies, R&D within Chaldea, and updated Heroic Spirits' contracts.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I am a Servant summoned by Chaldea, you see. Unlike Mash, I cannot jump to any era.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
However, if Fujimaru has a contract with me, then it would be another matter.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I would then be able to aid you as an ordinary Servant. I'm looking forward to such a fate, Master.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Wow, he really did introduce himself and run off. Now, as I was saying before I was interrupted...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm sorry but we don't have time to rest. We're going to prep for immediate Rayshift, ok?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course. I'm ready to go at any time.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Well, if I have to.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru, we have a coffin ready for you this time. You should be able to Rayshift safely and quickly now.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Seven singularities have been detected, but we've selected the time period with the smallest fluctuations.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Once you get there, we'll only be able to communicate with you.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Got it? I know I'm repeating myself, but the first thing is to set up a base camp and finding a leyline.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
After you've settled into the era, do what needs to be done. All right&mdash;Good luck, Fujimaru.   
   
**Announcement A:**   
Unsummon Program start. Spiritron Conversion start.   
   
**Announcement A:**   
Rayshift starting in 3, 2, 1...  
   
**Announcement A:**   
All procedures cleared. Grand Order commencing operation.   
   
## Section 1: Land of the Hundred Years' War   
   
**Mash:**   
...Sigh. We managed to reach here safely, Senpai.   
   
**Mash:**   
We were teleported by accident last time. This time it's a proper teleport via the Coffin with no physical anomalies.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Fou! Fou!   
   
**Mash:**   
Fou? Did you tag along again?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...kyuu, kyao...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can Fou Rayshift too?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Did he sneak into Mash's Coffin?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Seems that way. He must have sneaked into mine or Senpai's Coffin.   
   
**Mash:**   
Luckily, Fou was unharmed.   
   
**Mash:**   
Since he is attached to one of us, when we return he will automatically return as well.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
In that case, no problem, right?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I need to get back safely for Fou's sake, too.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. We share the same fate.   
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;Master. I have confirmed the time axis coordinates. Looks like it's the year 1431.   
   
**Mash:**   
It means we're in the middle of the Hundred Years' War. But this should be during the war's respite period.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Respite?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wars get time-offs?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, The Hundred Years' War did not fight for the full 100 years as the name implies.   
   
**Mash:**   
The war during this era was pretty carefree, relatively speaking.   
   
**Mash:**   
Captured knights were released for monetary payments almost every day...Senpai?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Look at the sky.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What is...Huh?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, we're connected! Not the best quality, but I've got video feed now too!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, what's wrong you two? Both of you staring at the sky like that.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, I'll send you visuals. What is that?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A ring of light...No, some form of magecraft cast over the satellite orbit?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In any case it's gigantic. At worst, it's as big as North America?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmmm, no records show such phenomena occurring in 1431.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's surely one of the reasons for the disappearance of our future. We'll have to analyze it on our end...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You guys concentrate on surveying onsite. Start by searching for leylines.   
   
**Mash:**   
What the Doctor said.   
   
**Mash:**   
Explore the area, make contact with the people of this era, set up the summoning circle, there are many things to do.   
   
**Mash:**   
We have to knock them out one at a time. Let's first move towards a city, Senpai.   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, stop. Confirming...Looks like a French scout brigade.   
   
**Mash:**   
What do we do? Should we attempt to make contact?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's do that.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Isn't it dangerous?   
   
**Mash:**   
They look like humanoids. I'm sure we can come to a peaceful resolution.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Hello, excuse me. We are travelers&ndash;  
   
**Soldier:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?   
   
**Soldier:**   
Eek! Enemy attack! Enemy attack!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yoo-hoo, I'm free now so lemme see how you're...Wait, why are you surrounded by an armed group?   
   
**Mash:**   
...I apologize. My mistake. I should've greeted them in French.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Was that the problem!?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They know what you're saying to begin with?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Of course. But now, I believe that combat is unavoidable.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You're starting with a fight? With French elites, even!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
W-Well, let's calm down first! That world is isolated.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No matter what happens, a time paradox can't occur. So engaging them won't be a problem, but...  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, give us an idea. Don't you know any French jokes for times like this?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hell if I know, I'm a loner! But wait, let me think...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I just need to think of a witty joke, right? Like "knock, knock! "  
   
**Soldier:**   
I'm hearing a silly voice from somewhere...All hands, ready your weapons! They're too suspicious!   
   
**Mash:**   
I apologize, Senpai. It was wrong of me to expect something from the Doctor.   
   
**Mash:**   
I think it would be bad to harm the locals. We should attack to hold them back!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What are YOU talking about now, Mash?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You've stooped as low as Roman!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
D-Did I say something wrong?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In that case, hit them with the back of your blade! Limit the bloodshed to a minimum! Back of the blade!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
With a shield?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How would you...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I'll think of something! FIREEE!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, burning is out of the question too!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...Sigh. Physical fatigue aside, the mental fatigue is overwhelming.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you all right?   
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you very much, Senpai.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Good job using the back of your blade.   
   
**Mash:**   
I didn't even know that was possible with a shield. I learned something today.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But...  
   
**Mash:**   
It seems like I didn't hit hard enough. They've retreated.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They're going back to their fort. Let's quietly chase them and ask what's going on.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Try not to aggravate them next time. Make sure you talk to them in French, okay?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Roger that, bonjour.   
   
**Mash:**   
Bonjour, monsieur.... I see, perfect. Leave it to me.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Roger that, danke schoen.   
   
**Mash:**   
Danke schoen, Herr. I see, somewhat perfect. I'll leave it to you.   
   
  
---  
  
   
## Section 2: Chase the French Soldier   
   
**Mash:**   
This is...Awful, isn't it?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's a complete ruin on the inside...The outer wall is more or less intact, but you can't call this a fort.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Because it's wartime?   
   
**Mash:**   
...No, that would still be impossible.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nothing but wounded soldiers here.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's right. Even though they're not in an active war&ndash;  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
In 1431, Charles VII of France entered a peace treaty with Philip III, an ally of England.   
   
**Mash:**   
Of course, I'm sure there were some skirmishes&ndash;  
   
**Soldier:**   
Argh! Here they come again!   
   
**Mash:**   
Bonjour. We are travelers.   
   
**Mash:**   
We are not here to harm you. Please put down your weapons, monsieur.   
   
**Soldier:**   
You're not...the enemy?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hm, that was rather easy. Perhaps they're rational now. Or&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They have no more fight left in them?   
   
**Mash:**   
Why didn't Charles VII sign the peace treaty?   
   
**Soldier:**   
King Charles? So you don't know?   
   
**Soldier:**   
The king is dead. He was burned by a witch's flames.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Dead? By witch's flames?   
   
**Soldier:**   
It's "Jeanne d'Arc. "She has risen again as the "Dragon Witch. "  
   
**Soldier:**   
England retreated quite a while ago. But, where have we to run to?   
   
**Soldier:**   
This is our home, but there's nothing we can do.   
   
**Mash:**   
Jeanne d'Arc is a witch?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who is Jeanne d'Arc?   
   
**Mash:**   
Saint Jeanne d'Arc, the savior. She is a world-renowned hero.   
   
**Mash:**   
A woman who stood up to save France from being conquered in the late stages of Hundred Years' War.   
   
**Mash:**   
She saved France at age 17, and managed to reclaim Orleans in just one year...  
   
**Mash:**   
But she was caught by the English army,and after an inquisition, burned at the stake.   
   
**Mash:**   
They say that from the time of her imprisonment till her burning, she endured gruesome torture and humiliation daily.   
   
**Mash:**   
England wanted to prove that she was not a saint, but a heretic.   
   
**Mash:**   
So they tried to torture her into saying"I did not hear the Lord's voice. "  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;However, her heart remained true. Even while burning, she held onto her prayers.   
   
**Mash:**   
Later, her honor was recognized, and after 400 years she was officially made a saint.   
   
**Mash:**   
A powerless girl's wishes changed the world&mdash;In that regard, Jeanne d'Arc is definitely a top-rank Heroic Spirit.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Soldier:**   
Here! They are here!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Magical energy signals are heading here!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Familiars created using human bodies...skeleton soldiers.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This time it's different. Both of you can be as wild as you want!   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. Orders, Master! Let's pulverize them!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...Phew. Good work.   
   
**Soldier:**   
You guys, I can't believe you took them on.   
   
**Mash:**   
...We're used to it. Anyway I'm sorry, but could you please explain this from the start?   
   
**Mash:**   
Is it true that Jeanne d'Arc has been resurrected?   
   
**Soldier:**   
Yes. I took part in the siege of Orleans and the ceremony, so I remember it well.   
   
**Soldier:**   
Her hair and skin color are different, but there's no question that she's the saint from the past.   
   
**Soldier:**   
Hearing that she'd been captured by the English and burned at the stake, we trembled in fury.   
   
**Soldier:**   
But&ndash;she was resurrected. And through a pact with the devil, no less!   
   
**Mash:**   
What do you mean the devil? Like the skeleton soldiers earlier?   
   
**Soldier:**   
Not those. At least those we can handle ourselves.   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Soldier:**   
Dammit, just as I thought! Here they come, engage!   
   
**Soldier:**   
Come on, stand up! Dragons are here! If you don't resist, they'll eat you!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Large creatures are shown to be near you! They're moving in fast!   
   
**Mash:**   
Visual confirmed! But that...It can't be&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Dragons!?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wyverns!?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. That is a subspecies of dragons called wyverns.   
   
**Mash:**   
That is definitely a creature that should not be in 15th Century France!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's coming!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, respond with full force! This is different from those old bones from earlier!   
   
**E：???:**  
Soldiers, douse yourself with water! You can momentarily defend against their flames!   
   
**Soldier:**   
Eh?   
   
**E：???:**  
You there! Please pick up a weapon and fight!   
   
**E：???:**  
Together with me! Follow me&ndash;!   
   
**Mash:**   
This is...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, she's a Servant! But her energy is weak, what is she...  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...I believe that was the last.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All right, fine job everyone! I was watching with sweaty palms and sweets in my hand!   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor. Those were the sweets that I got, right?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? What? Is that right? I found them in the Command Room next to the tea, so I thought...  
   
**Mash:**   
...I got them as a token of gratitude, for when we return from this Order.   
   
**Mash:**   
Needless to say, they weren't for you, but for Senpai, who no doubt fought bravely on the frontlines.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash...you've become such a thoughtful person...(gobble, gobble)  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I must say, these are some really tasty sweets. I'm sure Fujimaru will be thrilled, too!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Master. When we return to Chaldea, please reserve enough combat resources for one attack.   
   
**Mash:**   
I've registered one more enemy that I'd like to hit with the "back of my blade. "  
   
**Soldier:**   
Impossible, you're&ndash;No, no way! Run! The witch is here!   
   
**Mash:**   
Eh, a witch?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Um. Thank you very much.   
   
**Mash:**   
No, that was nothing. Before that, your name&ndash;  
   
**Jeanne:**   
"Ruler. "My Servant class is Ruler.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
My True Name is Jeanne d'Arc.   
   
**Mash:**   
Jeanne...d'Arc?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The one that became a witch...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I thought she was dead.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
We'll talk about that later. It is nothing we should speak of in front them.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Come over here. Please.   
   
**Mash:**   
...We've been invited. What should we do, Senpai?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's follow her.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's a clue.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Kyu kyu kyuu!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I agree as well. She looks weakened, but she's a Servant, too.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm sure she's aware of the situation in this era. Let's ask her for details.   
   
## Section 3: Jeanne's Mystery   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...They are few in number, but there does seem to be some evil presences.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
We are close to the fort. Before they invade, let's take them out.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
The enemy has been wiped out. Good job.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Yes. I think we can settle down here.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
First, please tell me your names.   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. My Individual Name is Mash Kyrielight.   
   
**Mash:**   
This is Fujimaru. My Master.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Master? So there are Masters even in this Holy Grail War.   
   
**Mash:**   
No, it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. I am just a Demi-Servant.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Demi-Servant?   
   
**Mash:**   
Not a true Heroic Spirit. Have you heard of us?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Right. We should probably clear that up first.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I am indeed a Servant, my class is Ruler. I understand that.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But...A majority of information about the Holy Grail War that should be provided is missing.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
No, not just information. My stats have ranked down as well.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Not only have I lost the anti-Servant Command Spells,I can't even reveal their True Names anymore.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Luckily this is my homeland where I was born and raised. If nothing else I still speak the language...  
   
**Mash:**   
That soldier earlier was saying that Jeanne d'Arc turned into a "Dragon Witch".   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Having just materialized a few hours ago, I am not sure what's going on.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
It seems there is another Jeanne d'Arc in this world.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
A Jeanne that murdered King Charles VII of France, and committed the slaughter at Orleans...  
   
**Mash:**   
So does that mean two of the same Servants have been summoned in the same era?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm...If we could access the Holy Grail War's records, there should be examples of simultaneous summons.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyway, one thing is for sure. Charles VII is dead, and Orleans has been occupied.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Which symbolizes the collapse of the nation of France.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In history, France was the first nation to declare human liberty and equality. Many countries followed suit.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Delaying this by 100 years would stagnate civilization.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Without progress we might still be stuck in the Middle Ages.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I just heard a voice...Is that magecraft? What in the world are you all&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh that's right, we didn't introduce ourselves. Nice to meet you, Saint Jeanne d'Arc.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
My name is Romani Archaman. Everyone calls me Roman.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I do various support tasks. Nice to meet you.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I see, Roman. You tend to be a dreamer!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...What is this sense of defeat? She complimented me, but I'm not happy at all...  
   
**Mash:**   
Excuse me, Mademoiselle Jeanne. It's our turn now.   
   
**Mash:**   
Our objective is the correction of this twisted history. We belong to an organization by the name of Chaldea.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...I see, I understand now. To think that the world itself has been incinerated.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
My worries were so trivial. But now, I&mdash;  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I'm an incomplete Servant, and even I cannot trust "myself. "  
   
**Jeanne:**   
The Jeanne 'd'Arc that occupied Orleans...Not only that, but those flying dragons...  
   
**Mash:**   
You mean the wyverns...There is no way wyverns existed in the 15th century France.   
   
**Mash:**   
More importantly, he called you a "Dragon Witch".   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Yes, I don't want to admit it, but the person controlling those dragons must be "myself. "  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I have no idea how she's controlling them. I never thought about such things during my life.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Summoning dragons is the highest form of magecraft, let alone to have this many&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's an impossible feat for modern mages. It should be difficult even for this era's magecraft.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That means...Fujimaru. If there's anything that could bend rules like this...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...It's likely to be a Holy Grail?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Exactly. It's only speculation, but these are no longer someone else's problems.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Smooth over chunky?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You're still bringing that up? You're pretty vindictive, aren't you?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see, there are still many unclear points, but I have an idea now.   
   
**Mash:**   
Mademoiselle Jeanne. What are you going to do from here?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...The objective is clear.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Head to Orleans, and take back the city. To do that, I must exterminate the Jeanne d'Arc who stands in my way.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
The Lord didn't show me the path, but I cannot turn my back on this.   
   
**Mash:**   
Even alone, you will fight...She's just like history says, Master.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, I thought so, too.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A startling difference from Da Vinci.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, and Doctor. Our objective and Ms. Jeanne's are the same.   
   
**Mash:**   
I was thinking about our next course of action...How about we help her?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course, I thought the same.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'd help even without a mission.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Right. It's best to work together with Jeanne here. It's a rare honor to fight alongside a Saint and Savior!   
   
**Mash:**   
Good. Then once again, Mademoiselle Jeanne.   
   
**Mash:**   
We have our own objectives, but we want to be of aid to you.   
   
**Mash:**   
Will you allow us to fight under your flag as your companions from now on?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Oh...The pleasure will be all mine. I cannot possibly thank you enough.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Thank you, Mash, Fujimaru. I thought I would be in this fight all alone.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Now at this place and time, we shall fight as one. So, Fujimaru, please give us your orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I'm so ashamed that I said I'd fight on my own earlier. Thanks to you two, I feel stronger than ever.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Even if I'm up against myself, a witch, I have nothing to be afraid of now the two of you are with me.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Being called a witch...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you all right?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I am fine.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Needless to say, it saddens me that they'd mistake me for that other Jeanne.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But it can't be helped.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
In fact, it hasn't been more than a few days since I was burned at the stake...  
   
**Jeanne:**   
If a resurrected me caused a massacre in Orleans, then I can't blame them for being scared of me.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...I was afraid the British might be stirred up, but it would appear things are going smoothly.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
We should seek out the Jeanne who they call a witch and defeat her.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But for now, we should scout around first. The goal is simple, but reaching it not so much.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As expected, Jeanne d'Arc is well-versed in the art of the war. Like she said, an assault on Orleans is ill-advised.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's an unfamiliar land and we have yet to set up any bases. For now, take the initiative and gather intel on their defenses.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As for the witch Jeanne&ndash;Or shall we call her Dark Jeanne? I would like to find out what kind of Servant she is.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The rest is up to our forces. It would be good to have more allies.   
   
**Mash:**   
Jeanne, is there a reading on any other Servants besides ourselves?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I'm sorry, but as I am now, I am incapable of using my ability as a Ruler to detect other Servants.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Like other ordinary Servants, I cannot detect them unless I am within a certain distance.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait, what about the other Jeanne?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Rulers can detect Servants?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I was careless. There is that possibility.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
The other me...No, Witch Jeanne...Urgh, it's too confusing, I will also refer to her as Dark Jeanne!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Anyway, if that Dark Jeanne is truly a Servant then her Class, like mine, is Ruler.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
If that is the case, she will immediately be able to detect our location. We must be prepared for battle at all times.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
If possible, I would like to minimize our activities in any nearby towns and villages&mdash;  
   
**Jeanne:**   
But without any lead on our hands, I doubt that's possible.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Let us head out early tomorrow morning. Fujimaru is human and should probably get some sleep...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll do that then.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you all right?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Yes, I am fine.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
My abilities may have gone down in rank, but I still possess the basic abilities of a Servant.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Well, good night.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Did Fujimaru go to sleep?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, surprisingly quick for someone who is unfamiliar with sleeping outdoors.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Is that so...  
   
**Mash:**   
...I could be imagining things, but is there something you aren't telling us?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't mean to pry...  
   
**Mash:**   
I thought it best to confront you in case it should become an obstacle in battle.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Quite right. As you wish, I shall tell you.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
It could be because my summoning was incomplete.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Or&ndash;perhaps it's because my original self died just a few days ago.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
How can I put it? It feels as if I am a "brand-new Servant. "  
   
**Mash:**   
A rookie, you mean?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Yes. There is no future or past in the Throne of Heroes.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But, I don't have the power to access the records there. Therefore, it is difficult for me to act as a Servant.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
It feels like going into battle for the first time all over again. And that bubbly-looking mage from before...  
   
**Jeanne:**   
He called me a saint and savior, but even with that expectation, I have no such power.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...So, the thing is. I fear that I will become a burden to you.   
   
**Mash:**   
Jeanne, if that's all then it's all right.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
What?   
   
**Mash:**   
I mean, this also feels like my first battle. We are the same.   
   
**Mash:**   
As a Demi-Servant, I cannot fully harness my power as a Heroic Spirit.   
   
**Mash:**   
However, the Heroic Spirit inside of me said "It's okay. "  
   
**Mash:**   
And Senpai&mdash;Master, trusts someone like me.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I don't know how to say this, but Senpai didn't choose to fight to prove something.   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai is simply trying to do what should be done, I think.   
   
**Mash:**   
So, it's all right. There's no reason for you to worry.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Thank you. I feel a little better.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I am pretty familiar with this era and this country. Let's give it our best tomorrow!   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes!   
   
## Section 4: Information Gathering   
   
**Jeanne:**   
First, let's cut through this forest and head to Orleans.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Of course, it will be difficult to enter directly.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But we might be able to get some information from the surrounding towns and forts.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
We're almost at La Charite.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
If we can't get any information here about Orleans, we'll have to get closer&ndash;  
   
**Jeanne:**   
I'd rather avoid that as much as possible.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
As long as I am still uncertain about the forces we have, we cannot engage.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're really cautious.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're really calm.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...No, to be honest, I am panicking. No matter how you look at it, the other "me" cannot be in her right mind.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
What that monster will do by controlling the people&ndash;it's easy to imagine.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Overwhelming power and hatred can easily destroy a person, no matter how noble they are.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&ndash;Wait a minute. A Servant was detected just ahead of your current path.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Its location is in La Charite, which is your destination.   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh, it's getting further away. Oh no, I've lost it! It's too far away!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Fou!!   
   
**Mash:**   
What is it Fou? Suddenly climbing on my head? You want to see the sky over there?   
   
**Mash:**   
The town...It's burning?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Let's hurry!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
It couldn't be!   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, life form detection&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...It's no use! There's nothing alive left in that town.   
   
**Mash:**   
It can't be&ndash;  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Wait. Just now, a sound!   
   
**Mash:**   
Wait a minute, that's&ndash;!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
No...It can't, be!   
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like they've turned into the living dead. Master, I will scatter them!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Gasp, gasp, gasp...  
   
**Mash:**   
Are you all right?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Yes. I'm fine&ndash;  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...They're still here. They look like wyverns.   
   
**Mash:**   
Are they...Ugh, no way!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Are they devouring the corpses?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Stop it!   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm going!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;That was the last of the wyverns. No sign of the enemy nearby. The battle is over.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
Jeanne?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...It was most likely "me" who was behind this.   
   
**Mash:**   
We can't be sure of that yet&ndash;  
   
**Jeanne:**   
No, I can tell. I am sure of it.... There's just one thing I don't understand.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
How much do you have to hate others to wreak such havoc?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I can't understand it.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hold up! The Servants that just left have reversed course! This isn't good. They must've realized you're here!   
   
**Mash:**   
How many?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You must be kidding. There are five!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They're fast...Are those Riders or something?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We don't stand a chance against them! We must run!   
   
**Mash:**   
But&ndash;!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We might be able to face them if we had the same numbers.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But there's no way you can fight an opponent that's several times stronger than you, is there?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's retreat, as any sane person would! It says so in the 36 Strategies of War!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
Jeanne! Servants are closing in&ndash;  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...I won't run. I must at least find out what their true intentions are!   
   
**Mash:**   
But!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's no use, we won't make it! Mash, just run, got it?   
   
## Section 5: Dark Jeanne   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Ugh!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&mdash;What, on earth? Who knew...Who knew such a thing could happen?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
&mdash;  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Could someone please pour some water on me. This is bad. It's awful. I think I'm really going to lose it.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
It's so funny I might die from laughing!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Take a look Gilles! Look at that pathetic girl! What is she a wimp? A mouse? A worm?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Either way, they're all the same! So puny, I can't even muster any sympathy!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Ah...truly&mdash;a country that could only cling to "me"...comparing them to mice is an insult to mice.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hey, Gilles, don't you think so&mdash;Oh, I see. We didn't bring Gilles along.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
You...Who are you?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I could ask the same of you...Right, as a leader, let me answer that.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I am Jeanne d'Arc. The saint devoted to France...the other "me. "  
   
**Jeanne:**   
What? That's nonsense. You are no saint. Just as I am no saint.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But, that is already a thing of the past. More importantly&mdash;Why did you attack this town?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Why, you ask? As the same Jeanne d'Arc,I thought you would understand.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Are you stupid now that your alignment has changed? The reason I attacked this city?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
What a foolish question. It's obvious, isn't it?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
It is for the sole purpose of destroying France. I am, after all, a Servant.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Politically, economically, these methods take too long. Is it not better to simply physically crush everything?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Such foolishness!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
"Such foolishness? "The foolish ones are us, Jeanne d'Arc.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Why did you want to save this country? Why did you want to bring salvation to these people?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
All the while knowing that they are the ones who spit on and betrayed us!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
That is&ndash;  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I will be fooled no longer. I will be betrayed no longer. I no longer hear the voice of the Lord.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
The fact that I cannot hear His voice, means the Lord no longer blesses this country.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
So, I will destroy it, in accordance to the Lord's grief. I will cut away all the bad seeds at the roots.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
As long as the human race exists, so will my hatred. I will remake this France into a land of the dead.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That's how I will save this country. By the hands of the new Jeanne d'Arc, reborn through death.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I suppose you could never understand. Always playing the saint.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Impossible for a pretty little holy virgin who pretends not to see hatred and joy and is incapable of human growth!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, what is human growth to Servants? If you're going to call it something, you would rank up as a Heroic Spirit.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&mdash;There appears to be a noisy fly here. Should I kill it if it's gets too annoying?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, wha-, the console's on fire! That Servant can burn her enemies with just a glare!?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Are you really "me"?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...I have played my part for you so clearly, yet you still have doubts?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
This rage is an ugly justice. It's not that you cannot understand it, you do not even have the will to try.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
But, I understand. Seeing you, I have realized all there is to the Heroic Spirit that is myself.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You are neither Ruler nor Jeanne d'Arc. You are nothing but some leftover residue that I threw away.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
!!!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
If you were the same existence and Class as I, then I should have felt something.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
But you are worthless. Nothing but a ghost with a misguided effort to recreate history.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Berserk Lancer, Berserk Assassin. Finish off that country girl.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You're getting tired of small prey, aren't you? Rejoice, they are strong.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Among all the Servants I summoned, your thirst for blood is the strongest.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You exist to crush the brave. Devour them to your heart's content.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
&mdash;Very well. Now, I will have your blood.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Not so fast "my King. " I would like to partake of her flesh and blood, as well as her insides.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
So greedy. And her soul? Who gets to take her soul?   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
There is no gain in taking her soul. Do you think honor or reputation can maintain my beauty?   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
Very well. Then I shall take her soul. It's quite ironic though.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
I am able to understand her beauty, only after I have fallen as a blood-sucking devil.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Yes. That is precisely why I cannot hold back my emotions.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
I will not forgive anything more beautiful than me. No, more than that&mdash;  
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
The blood of those more beautiful than me, can only elevate my beauty!   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Ah, how fun it is to crush such fresh fruit. I'll throw away the skin and just enjoy the juice&mdash;  
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
This is the privilege of being a Noble of the Night. I'll squeeze every last drop out of you.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Ugh!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Master.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's do this.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We have no other option.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right!   
   
**Mash:**   
Jeanne! Get ready, they're coming!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
U-Understood!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
I can't believe you couldn't finish off a young girl...I wonder if you felt sympathy for her.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Kindness doesn't suit you. It's not very monster-like, Dracul.   
   
**Mash:**   
Dracul...no way.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Vlad III...Romania's greatest hero. Also known as the Lord Impaler.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
Who knew that you'd reveal my True Name in front of others. I'm extremely displeased.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
What's wrong? I would rather be remembered by a bad name than not at all.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Besides...I prefer to be called by my True Name. Dread and despair, faintly spiced with hope.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
The ones with the best cries are the little squirrels who think "I can escape. "  
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
But in the end, you were driven to ruin by the hands of those who actually escaped.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
Elisabeth Báthory. Otherwise known as Carmilla. How humorous your tragic end was.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
How boring. That's why I don't like your kind. Even as you're damned as a vampire, you still cling to your noble "heart. "  
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
&mdash;You mean to say that I cling to my faith even now?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Stop this instant. I told you that you could devour freely,but do not forget who is friend and foe.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Turn your animosity to those little girls now. Save your petty squabbles for later.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Ah, you misunderstand, Master. Secretly, I idolize Count Vlad as a leader.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
That's the first I've heard of it. Comparing idolizing with plotting assassination.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wow...They're fighting amongst themselves...It's a bad work environment, over there.   
   
**Mash:**   
Do not let your guard down, Master. They still intend to kill us!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
All right, it's my turn. Please don't mistake me for that kind Count Vlad.   
   
**Mash:**   
Master...Elisabeth Báthory.... Do you know her?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Blood Countess, was it?   
   
**Mash:**   
That's right. Like Vlad III, she was feared as a monster&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
She believed that bathing in the blood of virgins would keep her youthful. She's said to have murdered hundreds of girls.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Never heard of her.   
   
**Mash:**   
She was a Hungarian noble, who was said to have abducted and slaughtered young girls.   
   
**Mash:**   
She believed bathing in their blood would make her skin youthful again.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Saints' blood is valuable. No woman would let go of a gem placed before her!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Something doesn't feel right. Was that the reason Count Vlad...  
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
You over there, young lady. You&mdash;smell horrible.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
A girl of such tender years, yet so battle-hardened. How contradictory. Who is she?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...A Demi-Servant. An anomaly, a cross between a human and a Servant.   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...That was my mistake. You two are crueler than the others, but that's why you're so playful.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Let the remaining three deal with this girl.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
Wait, Carmilla and I can still fight. The saint's blood belongs to us.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
As if I would allow mere executioners who know nothing of the radiance of blood, the grandeur of blood, take...  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Shut up. Know your place, Vlad III.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
No matter how much authority you may have had in life, you're all equals as Servants.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You wanted so badly to suck her blood that you unconsciously held back. You haven't learned a thing.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&mdash;I hate people like that. Stay out of it this time, okay?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Mash, run! I'll hold her off!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh no, is she sending those three after us now? What do we do? Any ideas? Any ideas?   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, please calm down. You're starting to make me panic, too!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
B-But this is really bad, right! Okay, where's my email? I need the internet's help!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Off to the internet idol page! Help me Magi☆Mari! Help me Magi☆Mari!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
"We're being attacked by three Servants. What should we do? " Okay, sent.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
"I guess you'll have to just die and be reborn! ☆"  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wow, internet idols are HARSH! She doesn't know how I feel!   
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;Master, I'm going to try and break through.   
   
**Mash:**   
Stay close!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That should be enough. Just in case, I will make sure to remove your head from your body.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Both of you, please go!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
What?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&ndash;What?   
   
**Mash:**   
A glass&ndash;rose?   
   
**F：???:**  
&ndash;It's not elegant.   
   
**F：???:**  
Neither is this city. Neither is that combat style. I don't like your philosophy or principles either.   
   
**F：???:**  
You're so beautiful, yet you shroud yourself in blood and hatred.   
   
**F：???:**  
For good or for evil, shouldn't a human try to be more free?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...A Servant?   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**F：???:**  
Yes, that's right. I'm so happy. This is what it means to announce oneself as a hero of justice!   
   
**F：???:**  
I know who you are. I also know how powerful and terrifying you are.   
   
**F：???:**  
To be honest, I have to confess that I've never trembled in fear more before anyone else.   
   
**F：???:**  
Yet still&mdash;If you intend to invade this nation, then I shall face you even if I have to tear apart my dress.   
   
**F：???:**  
Why? Because...  
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
You are...  
   
**F：???:**  
Oh my. So you know my True Name. Have we met before, splendid female knight?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Saber. Who is she?   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
...  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&ndash;Answer me.   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
I can tell who she is, even with this murderous rage burning in my heart. Her beauty is unmistakable.   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
The girl they called the Flower of Versailles. She is&mdash;Marie Antoinette.   
   
**Mash:**   
Queen Marie Antoinette?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
That's right! Thank you for saying my name!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
And as long as that name exists, I will play my role, no matter how foolish it may be.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
You! Dragon Witch who's torching my country. It might be pointless, but I will ask you anyway.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Are you evil enough to perform your wicked deeds in my very presence?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Will you declare yourself a greater fool than I, the queen who failed to stop the revolution?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Silence! You lack the right to participate in this battle.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh, and why is that?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You led a life of luxury in a palace, and died without even knowing what happened. Are you saying you can understand our hatred?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Hmm...I suppose I can't. But that just makes me want to know more, Dragon Witch.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...What?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
What I don't know, I learn. That's my policy.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
That's why I can't bear to look at you like this. Oh, Jeanne d'Arc, beloved saint!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
All I know is that you're taking your rage out on the innocent.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
And I've not the slightest idea why. Everything's disappearing into a haze, like a girl going for a Sunday walk.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I've no words for you. What I do know is this.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Along with the Jeanne d'Arc over there. I am going to make your heart and body mine!   
   
**Mash:**   
What?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Uh...huh?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh, my. Oh dear, oh dear. Um, don't misunderstand me.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I just meant that as a Queen, I'm going to bring you to your knees.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...It's falling apart...My image of Marie Antoinette is falling apart...  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&mdash;Enough of this farce. Very well then, you are my enemy.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Servants, first take care of that annoying princess! Then the others!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jeanne:**   
We survived somehow. So did she!   
   
**Mash:**   
Gasp...gasp...gasp...  
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
Damn, so irritating!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes, that's right. This is a battlefield, after all. That's enough talk.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
You're the enemy of the world, aren't you? So first&ndash;We must appease the souls of all those you murdered.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Thank you for waiting, Amadeus. Crush them like bugs!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Leave it to me! Noble Phantasm, "Requiem for Death. "  
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
One more! Oh, but what a glorious, evil sound!   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
Ugh, such pressure!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Damn!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Now then, good day everyone. Au revoir!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Hmph. Rider!   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
...What is it?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Go after them. Surely you can catch them on your "horse. "  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
There's no need to fight.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Just tell me where they are, and I'll crush them.   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
...Understood. I assure you I'll catch them.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Ahh, that awful noise is gone...What a shame.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
I wonder if I can make that Servant my pet. I'd stick his head on a phonograph and have him scream all night.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
...Ruler. Do you think Rider alone is enough to handle them?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
It will be fine. Rider's Noble Phantasm is perfect for destroying them.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...But you're right, I should be careful. I'll return and prepare to summon additional Servants.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Go ahead and cause as much trouble as you like. If you're lucky enough to find them, slay them.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You're not going to be beaten by an queen who never left her castle, are you?   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
How harsh. I stayed in a castle too.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
But...Heh. My talents are a match for any of the others.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Saber, Lancer. The next time we fight, will you let me handle the enemy Rider?   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
May I ask why?   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
She is the person I wish to slaughter most in this world. It will be that woman Marie who kneels before me.   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
...  
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Oh, Saber. Is there something you'd like to add?   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
You're right. There's no point in me worrying about your sense of inferiority towards her.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
&ndash;What did you say?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Stop. I don't care. It doesn't matter who beats who, the result doesn't change.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I leave this in your hands. Don't get too out of control.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Even Anti-Heroes have their dignity. Make sure you don't become mere murderers.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
...She flew off, huh? "Dragon Witch" is certainly the right word for her.   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
&ndash;The woman we just faced was the real Jeanne d'Arc, wasn't she?   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
What of it? Ours isn't a fake either.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
And we are Servants, in search of blood. &ndash;Though you may not be, even in this state...  
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
Chevalier d'Eon. The noble dragoon.   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
...I will obey my Master. If she wishes to end the world, I will help her.   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
And I too, am under Madness Enhancement. Do not anger me.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
&ndash;Heh. My apologies.   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
...  
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
It's hard not to feel pity. The Queen they respected, who sent them a dress, is now her enemy.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
But that is the fate of a Servant. That is the nature of the Holy Grail War.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Lancer, let's go. We must search the next city.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
We are vampires, who must drink the blood of the living. Finding our next meal is a matter of life and death.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
...Indeed, none of these meals are satisfactory. But I'll take what I can get.   
   
## Section 6: One Thing After Another   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
&ndash;Phew. All right, are we safe now?   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes. I'm not detecting them anymore.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
While we're at it, I'm picking up leyline readings from that nearby forest.   
   
**Mash:**   
Very well. Jeanne? And...Marie?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Marie, did you say?   
   
**Mash:**   
F-Forgive me. Um&ndash;  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
You weren't being rude! You made me so happy! The way you addressed me was so adorable!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Please, splendid foreigner! Would you mind calling me that from now on?   
   
**Mash:**   
Uh, yes...Miss Marie, or Mademoiselle Marie, perhaps?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Nope, that won't work at all. Just Marie! Like the sheep!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm pretty sure that was 'Mary'...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nice to meet you, Marie.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Nice to meet you! I'm Marie!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I love understanding [♂ gentlemen /♀ ladies]. Let me guess. You're very popular with the opposite sex, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Marie, may I speak?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh, my apologies. I got excited for a minute. How rude of me.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
So, how may I be of service?   
   
**Mash:**   
A strong leyline was detected in a nearby forest. I'd like to head there and make camp...  
   
**Mash:**   
Is that all right, everyone?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Of course, that's fine. Is that all right with you, Amadeus?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
There's no point in asking for my opinion. Do what you want, Maria.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
All right. It should be fine, I think.   
   
**Mash:**   
Let's go there and rest, and then we can talk about our next move.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Looks like some monsters have found the leyline too.   
   
**Mash:**   
Let's get rid of them!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...Now I will establish a summoning circle.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey guys, are you enjoying your trip through 15th century France?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Now then, let's get today's lecture started. Today I'll be talking about Servant categories.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Most of the Servants that can be summoned are divided into seven classes.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Saber, Archer, Lancer, Rider, Berserker, Caster, Assassin.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Each class has various compatibilities.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Saber has the advantage over Lancer, for instance. And Lancer over Archer, and Archer over Saber.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Rider over Caster, Caster over Assassin, and Assassin over Rider.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And Berserker is strong against all classes, but weak when attacked.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It's like a game of rock, paper, scissors. Keep this in mind when fighting the enemy.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Of course, there are some Servants who don't fall into these categories.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'll explain them another time. Okay, circle's good to go. Have a nice journey!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Now that things have settled down, I'd like to introduce myself again.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
My True Name is Marie Antoinette. I'm from the Rider Class.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
As for who I am, I'd be happy if you could examine me closely with your eyes and ears.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
As for why I was summoned, unfortunately,I have no idea. After all, I have no Master.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. I'm the same as her.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
As for why I was summoned, first of all, it just doesn't feel like I'm a hero.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Yes I'm great, but even so, I'm still just one of many artists...  
   
**Amadeus:**   
Well, I did apply magecraft in my music, but that was only because I was drawn to the sounds played by demons.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm Mash Kyrielight. I'm a Demi-Servant, and I don't know what my True Name is.   
   
**Mash:**   
This is Fujimaru. My Master.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nice to meet you.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Pleasure is mine. As fellow non-fighters, let's get along.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Whassup.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh my! What an interesting greeting! Wh...Whassup! My homies!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Hmph, it seems different when Fujimaru says it...Perhaps I need to think more like a peasant...  
   
**Mash:**   
Come on...Don't teach her weird greetings.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh, I've got it! I have to be more needy! Come on, Amadeus! Whassup!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Whassup! I like it, Maria. Keep it up! I can feel the love of a century beginning to fade!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...Hmmph.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I'm sorry Fujimaru. Whassup is a very stimulating greeting, but I must reluctantly refrain from it.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
If Amadeus likes it, that means it's not appropriate for a lady to use.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Let's not be slanderous here. You're acting like I'm a pervert gentleman who loves dirty jokes.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Don't blame me. You're a child when it comes to everything but music.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
And this is&ndash;  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Jeanne. Jeanne d'Arc, yes?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
The saint who saved France. One of the people I wished to meet in my life.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...I'm, not a saint.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes, everyone knows that's how you saw yourself.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
But the way you lead your life was true, and we all know the results.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
That's why everyone will always remember and admire the name Jeanne d'Arc, and the miracle of Orleans.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
   
**Amadeus:**   
Of course, your life ended at the stake and resulted in that witch. It's just like Maria to only look at the good parts.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Am I wrong, Jeanne d'Arc? Your life was a little out of tune.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Jeanne herself is the one who gets hurt when people call her a perfect saint.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Listen, Maria. You always say what you think others want to hear. Sometimes you need to scold or deny others.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I-I don't need to hear that from you, Amadeus! You already tell me that every day!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
T-This is what you want, right? You piano-brain! Piece of human garbage!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
You're a pervert who can only get it up for musical scales! If you like music so much, you should turn into a piano!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
...I don't know if I should say this, but when you insult me like that, I feel something indescribable.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
But see? You can do it if you try! Give the same treatment to Jeanne.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Faster. Stronger. More violent! Tell her all of her flaws as you see them!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Non, that's impossible Amadeus.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Human garbage like you has nothing but flaws. But Jeanne herself has none.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
&mdash;Are you serious? I didn't know you had it that bad. You really did love Jeanne d'Arc, didn't you?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I would say "worship" rather than love. And a bit of guilt, as well.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...A tiny "sorry", the size of a teaspoon. The natural guilt we foolish royals feel towards the Saint.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Marie Antoinette. Your words honor me, but that's why I must confess.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
In life, I was no saint.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I held the flag high for what I believed in, and as a result, I stained my hands with blood.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Of course, I don't regret that. Nor do I regret the Inquisition&ndash;Or my own death.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But I shed too much blood. I believed in the dreams of a little country girl, but&mdash;  
   
**Jeanne:**   
At the time, I never imagined how high the price of that dream was.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I never regretted it, but never did I feel fear.... And that is my greatest sin.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Only the outcome of my actions made me a saint. I do not think it's the right word for a country girl like me.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...I see. So you're not a saint, right?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Then, may I call you Jeanne?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Y-Yes. Of course. It feels like that would bring back old memories.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Wonderful. Call me Marie, then.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
If you're simply Jeanne, and not a saint, then I want to be Marie, and not a queen.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Please Jeanne, will you call me Marie?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Y-Yes. All right...Thank you, Marie.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Thank you too. I am happy, Jeanne!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
And I'm sorry. I keep pushing my own views on you. You've lost your own answers about yourself, haven't you?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Just like the day I died, not knowing a thing about what was going on. You'll have to find your own answers.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I certainly want to treat you as a saint, but I'll stop myself!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I won't just believe in you, I'll support you! Isn't that what female friends are supposed to do, Amadeus?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
I suppose so, yeah? You guys can go eat sweets or something.   
   
**Mash:**   
We believe in you too. Right, Master?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Heh, heh, thank you. That makes me feel better.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Fake monsters are a common thing.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
F-Fake monsters?   
   
**Mash:**   
Master...Don't say things that are going to confuse her.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I don't know about fake monsters, but I do know about monsters!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Look, it seems like we have invited some unwanted guests.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
No, I don't think you invited them. Well, whatever. Let's get rid of them and resume our conversation!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
&ndash;Now I understand. The whole world, never mind France, is in danger.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Although it's in a different form, this too, is a Holy Grail War?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
I knew it was dangerous when I learned it was a Master-less summoning, but I didn't expect this.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Now there were five Servants in opposition. Nine total including Mash, but isn't that too much?   
   
**Mash:**   
The rule of seven Servants is no more.... Although that doesn't mean infinite.   
   
**Mash:**   
It's not surprising at all if there are more than seven Servants.   
   
**Mash:**   
...According to the records, one time a total of fifteen Servants fought.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh, I get it! I've figured it out, everyone!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
We were summoned so that&ndash;We could defeat them, like heroes!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It might be to destroy the world.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Non, non, non! That's not right, Fujimaru.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I love everybody. Just as I did when I was alive.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I wouldn't need these feelings to destroy the world, and they wouldn't summon me anyway!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think you're right.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes, yes! I finally feel like I've found my job in life!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Amadeus:**   
It's perfectly fine to be confident, Maria. But we're up against powerful foes.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Jeanne and Mash, as well as Fujimaru, are used to combat. But you and I aren't the fighting type.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
The numbers matter less than the fact that they're far stronger.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Indeed. Vlad III, and Elisabeth Báthory.   
   
**Mash:**   
One carved their name into history as a hero, and the other, a murderess...  
   
**Mash:**   
The other that looked like a Saber seemed to know Marie...  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...That's right. If she knows who I am, then...  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Perhaps she's Chevalier d'Eon? I've no proof, though.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Chevalier d'Eon...A spy with Louis XV's intelligence agency, the Secret du Roi.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
She was also a Dragoon, and a plenipotentiary minister...She, no, maybe he?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
It matters little, mage from a distant world.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
She was summoned from a different time than me, but her splendid face hasn't changed.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see...It would be wonderful if she would join us...  
   
**Jeanne:**   
That might be difficult, I think.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I've lost my Ruler's ability to see True Names, but there is one thing I could see.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
All of them have been given "Madness Enhancement," regardless of their alignment or background.   
   
**Fou:**   
Kyuu...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's probably the power of the Grail. Even without an episode of madness, it can give them Berserker traits...  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Hmph. The goal of a Holy Grail War is to get the Grail, but they already have it.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
It's not fair!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But that leaves one mystery. Why were you summoned?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...This is just a theory.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Despite the fact that the Holy Grail War hasn't begun, someone already has the Grail.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
This is a reversal of causality. A bug, if you will,and perhaps the Grail is resisting it.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
The greater the opponent, the more powerful the Grail's reaction.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I see. In other words, somewhere else in France&ndash;  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Indeed. There may be other Servants summoned here like Marie.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh my! That means I can meet even more people, right?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
That's not necessarily a good thing. It may just mean more enemies.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
But whichever it is, we should start searching for them as soon as we can.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Before the other Jeanne finds them.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Indeed. I've lost my ability to detect Servants.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
So we'll have to depend on Mr. Roman.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sure thing. I can't match a full-powered Ruler,but I can search farther than a Servant.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Let's take a little break first! You're all tired, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes Master, rest for a bit. We'll stand watch.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm going to patrol the area. Jeanne, please wait here.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, Fou!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Is something wrong, Jeanne? You seem defeated...Are you tired?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Marie...No, I'm not tired. I am a Servant, after all.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Perhaps you're saddened by the state France is in...I mean, are you disappointed?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
No, I'm not disappointed. Thank you for your concern, Marie.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But...Seeing those familiar towns in flames is a bit hard to bear.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes...For you, especially, this era is exactly like it was when you were alive.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
It's different than what I feel inside...Memories that are still going on.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes! Why don't we take this time to talk? Girls' night out!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Excuse me?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh, is that strange? But both you and I were summoned in the bloom of our youth.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
You see? I'm in the middle of puberty, right? So I love talking about love and romance!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Ahaha...I appreciate the offer, but that's hard for me. I know of compassion, but not romance.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
But...You're missing out on life! It's not too late to start! Fall in love with someone, Jeanne!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Of course, if I get the chance. Have you fallen in love, Marie?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Heheh, of course.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I fell in love with a boy who proposed to me at age 7. I think it was my first love.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
And when I was 14, I fell in love with the king I married.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
14! That's kind of amazing.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
When I was that age...I was working and playing in the fields with the other children.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
That sounds fun, too! I'm jealous. It must be such fun to be able to go wherever you want!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Yes, it was fun. What I lacked in romance, I made up for in friendship.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Did all the boys like you?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Hmm, my hair was short then, so they treated me like one of the guys&ndash;  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh, I'm so glad I became a Servant! I can't believe I'm having girl talk with Jeanne d'Arc.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
It's good to be a queen!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
The honor is mine. Who would've thought that I get to talk to the famous Marie Antoinette.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
It's good to be a Servant.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I'm just glad that this isn't a real Holy Grail War. Otherwise, we couldn't chat like this&ndash;  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Marie.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry, both of you. It appears to be an enemy attack!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I knew it.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh my.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'll go wake up Master!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Come Jeanne, let us fight like proper Servants.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Bravely, gallantly, whole-heartedly, and yet beautifully, like a maiden in love.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
That's what you and I are at our core. Neither saints, nor queens.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...The way I fight has little to do with beauty and elegance, I'm afraid.   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, your orders!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Come, Fujimaru.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I'll show you the power that I couldn't show you before!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
&mdash;Tomboy princess, coming through! I'll dance brilliantly, like glasswork!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Servants detected! Also, multiple life-forms detected!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Master!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Prepare for battle!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
What a drag. I've detected it, too. Having good hearing isn't always a good thing.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
In fact, I hate this sound so much it makes me want to scream.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
The sound of an enemy's footstep, is worse than a high-pitched trumpet.   
   
**Mash:**   
You can hear them at this distance?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Of course. I became a Servant because of my music. I can detect any sound wave in the air.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
For instance, the sound of you and Maria's sleeping when we were camping. I enjoyed listening to them both.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
But, not just the sound of you sleeping. I've recorded all the tiny sounds your body makes in my Wolfgang Recorder!   
   
**Mash:**   
!!! A-A sexually harassing Servant!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I'm sorry, Mash. As his keeper, I apologize.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
But bear with him a little. Without his ears, he's nothing more than a pervert!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
What are you saying? Human beings create filth just by living!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Only by realizing that can you create true music. Life is filth, and music cleanses it.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
&mdash;Now then, I hear footsteps, and drawn swords.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Naught but boorish noise. I don't write my music for fools, but&ndash;  
   
**Amadeus:**   
You've come all this way. I shall play my Requiem of Death for you!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
All that's left are the Servants!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Is everybody all right? Does anyone need healing?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
We're good here. What about you, Mash?   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm fine. Doctor, are they here yet?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&ndash;They're coming. Are you ready?   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
...Hello, everybody. What a lonely night.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;Who are you?   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
Who? Let's see, I wonder who I am.   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
I forced myself to be a righteous saint, but in this world I'm a slave to a broken one.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
A broken saint...  
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
Yes, thanks to her, my reason has left and I've gone mad.   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
I am doing everything I can to hold myself back. What a mess this is.   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
So while I appreciate your hopes, I cannot join you.   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
You don't want a Servant who'll stab you from behind at every single opportunity, do you?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Then why did you come here?   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
...My task was to observe you, but my waning reason whispers that I should test you.   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
You face the Dragon Witch. Disaster incarnate, riding on the "ultimate dragon. "  
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
If you cannot surpass me, you will never defeat her.   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
Defeat me. Plunge your blade into my heart without hesitation.   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
My True Name is Martha. Now come to me, Iron Dragon Tarasque!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Martha...Saint Martha? Watch out, everyone!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
She once defeated a dragon with nothing but prayers! If she's a Servant, that means&ndash;  
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
Let us see if you are capable of slaying me&ndash;!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
She's a dragon rider!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
...I see. That's enough.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Martha. Did you&ndash;  
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
Hold back? Of course not.   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
This is fine, it's fine this way. Seriously, don't make a saint massacre you!   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
...Listen, let me tell you one last thing. You'll never beat the dragon controlled by the Dragon Witch.   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
There's only one way to surpass that type of dragon. Go to Lyon...the city once known as Lyon.   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
It won't be a saint who defeats the dragon, nor a princess. Ever since ancient times, only a "Dragon Slayer" is capable of killing a dragon.   
   
**Berserk Rider:**   
Tarasque, I'm sorry.... Next time, I hope I'll be summoned properly.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Even Saint Martha can't resist her.   
   
**Mash:**   
She'd undergone Madness Enhancement, in addition to being summoned. Perhaps it can't be helped.   
   
**Mash:**   
Normally it would be impossible to even talk to her.   
   
**Mash:**   
The only reason we were able to communicate was because of her incredible self-control.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes. She was a peaceful, yet fierce as a person. I could tell.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
She is the Iron Saint. She is a woman like adamantite,who solves things with her fists in the end.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
They say she defeated the Tarasque with a sermon, but I bet she just beat it up.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Anyway, thanks to her, we know where we're going.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
We should hurry, right? Let's get going to Lyon.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm surprised. Amadeus seemed like, um, the type of person who'd hate to travel on foot...  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh no, Amadeus loves traveling. He's traveled to many places ever since he was a child.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
...Well, I suppose it's true that I'm used to traveling.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Hehe, I'm getting excited. I wonder what, and who, waits for us in Lyon!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Come on, Jeanne. Let's get going.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Right!   
   
## Section 7: Search for the Dragon Slayer   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Did Rider commit suicide? It's troublesome that she retained her sanity even with Madness Enhancement.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Still, she likely fought with all of her might. If that's the case, we can't let our guard down.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Next time, "he" and I will mobilize. I'm also taking the Servants summoned today.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Please contact the Berserk Assassin.   
   
**Gilles:**   
Understood. If I were who I was before, I would've stopped you.   
   
**Gilles:**   
But now, you're perfect Jeanne! You don't even need luck!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Please trample over them as much as you wish.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Gilles. Which do you think is the real one? Me, or her?   
   
**Gilles:**   
Of course it's you. Are you listening, Jeanne?   
   
**Gilles:**   
You were burned at the stake. Betrayed, by everyone!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Charles VII left you to die, because he didn't want to pay the ransom!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Not a single person rose to bravely fight for your return!   
   
**Gilles:**   
And what was the cause of all this? It was God! It was our God, mocking us!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Thus, we deny God. Don't we, Jeanne?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Yes. Yes you're right, Gilles. I have nothing left.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
My soldiers are gone, and my admirers fled. The king betrayed me and the bishop burnt me in the name of God.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&mdash;I was wrong. No, everything was wrong.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Not just what I believed in. The very country that allowed me to exist was wrong.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
This mistake must be righted. Jeanne d'Arc was a mistake.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
So let us do as they decided, and make it all so it never happened.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
My salvation of the country was itself a fatal mistake.   
   
**Gilles:**   
...Jeanne. Please, don't put yourself under such stress.   
   
**Gilles:**   
This is a divine punishment. Nothing more. Your revenge is righteous. What you saved, you may destroy.   
   
**Gilles:**   
Isn't that all there is to it?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...You're right, Gilles. What you say is extreme, but it brings me strength.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Let's go, Berserker, Assassin...This is getting complicated. May I use your True Names?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Lancelot, Knight of the Lake; and the Executioner, Charles-Henri Sanson.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Mount your wyverns. I shall lead you.   
   
**Lancelot:**   
&mdash;Urrrrrr.   
   
**Sanson:**   
...Of course, Master. Only I am fit to take the head of the Queen.   
   
**Citizen:**   
...And that's what happened...  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I see, I see! Understood. How interesting. How very interesting!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Thank you, kind sir. Farewell, until we meet again!   
   
**Citizen:**   
Y-Yes ma'am! Um, by the way, you seem to be of noble birth. What is your name&ndash;  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
My name is Marie Antoinette! Hehe, it might be worth remembering.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...Keep passing it down for 360 years or so, and someone might be in for a surprise, hehe.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Guys! I got the information!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Sorry, Marie. I will cause a panic if I go into town...  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Don't worry, Jeanne. We're both Servants, you know.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Now, I've got some great information. The city St. Martha told us of, Lyon.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
To put it simply, Lyon was destroyed a little while ago. Its refugees have settled here.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
The "used to be" nuance interests me.... So it's just as I thought?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes. The town is filled with monsters that seem to have risen from the depths of Hell.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
But I think what came before that is the important part. They said Lyon had a protector.   
   
**Mash:**   
A protector?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
A knight with a large sword, who defeated wyverns and skeletons.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I see. Perhaps that's the Servant Martha spoke of before.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes. But a little while ago, some scary people came.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Servants, probably. He was overwhelmed by their numbers and is now missing.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
And so Lyon was destroyed...  
   
**Mash:**   
I hope he's alive...No, let's believe in the words of St. Martha.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh, right. Charles VII visited the village and General Gilles de Rais marshalled the routed soldiers, they said.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Gilles!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
He's attempting to attack Lyon and take back the city.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sure it would be...difficult to meet with him.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Why is that? Gilles de Rais is an admirer of Jeanne, right?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
If Jeanne asks, he's sure to lend a helping hand?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...That's precisely the reason. He knows that I've become the Dragon Witch.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
He wouldn't accept me like that.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...I see. I'm not sure if that's quite right.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
But I understand that you might not want to see him! You're a girl, after all.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes, I agree we don't need to see him! We're in a hurry, after all.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I don't think normal soldiers can handle all those monsters in Lyon, anyway...  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...You're quite right. Let's defeat them on our own.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We can do it.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No problem.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Fujimaru...You're right. This is nothing.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes, that's what it means to be a [♂ boy /♀ commander]! Here's your reward!   
   
**Mash:**   
What?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Well? Was it good?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you!   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai...You have a goofy grin on your face.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, hang in there.... Jeez!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Amadeus:**   
She finally went and did it, huh? Sorry, just ignore that.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Maria has a bad habit of kissing everything. It caused chaos in the palace.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
There were actually factions formed of people she'd kissed and people she hadn't.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
No playwright would touch a story about a court that almost destroyed itself before the revolution.   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, come on. Snap out of it. Snap out of it!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Huh? You guys don't do kisses?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Maybe like when your heart feels like someone's squeezing it...You do it too, right Jeanne?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I-I do not! I do not! Only with someone I was going to marry&mdash;  
   
**Amadeus:**   
...Huh? Hey, hold on a second.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Those soldiers over there seem ready to kill. I don't think they're back from the front.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Seems like they've become bandits. This tragedy is enough to shatter anyone's mind.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
We cannot let the townspeople suffer. Let us capture them.   
   
**Mash:**   
Got it. Back of the blade it is!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
...But that's a shield right?   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
We've tied up the bandits, let's hand them to the town's people. I think we can leave the rest to them.   
   
**Mash:**   
All right, let's head out everybody!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
We're almost there, don't you think?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Yes, we should be.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...The thought of having to see a ruined town again, is heartbreaking.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...There's no one here.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, any signs of life&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor?   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry. Reception's not very good here.   
   
**Mash:**   
Let's split up and search for that "Dragon Slayer" Martha mentioned.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Right. Let's see which of us finds that person first. Amadeus and I will take the west side.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Then Mash and I will take the east.   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. Let's go, Master!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
This was once a beautiful town. Why would that Dragon Witch do this&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's a fake.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's not you.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
That'd be nice, but...Huh? Did I just hear a voice?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, faintly. It may be a survivor. Let's go check it out.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Ugh!   
   
**Mash:**   
Living Dead!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Turning the townsfolk into monsters...This is beyond heresy!   
   
**Mash:**   
We can't save them anymore...Ready for battle, Master!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Rest in peace.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Be at peace.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Even more enemies!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes, just as I thought! I hurried back, but they're swarming over here too!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
You may not need any help, but I can't just sit around!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I will help you, Fujimaru!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Wyvern!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
What? I am tired of seeing them. They are no more than third-rate instruments, time to get rid of them!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Phew! Enemies eliminated. May their souls rest in peace&ndash;  
   
**G：???:**  
Peace...Do they desire peace? That is such a foolish thing to say.   
   
**G：???:**  
They have no peace in their souls. There is certainly none residing in us Servants&ndash;  
   
**G：???:**  
This world has been frozen for years...  
   
**Mash:**   
...Servant!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;Who are you?   
   
**Phantom:**   
Correct. People call me&ndash;The Phantom of the Opera.   
   
**Phantom:**   
By order of the "Dragon Witch,"this town is under my absolute control.   
   
**Phantom:**   
Now, now, now. This is the middle of Hell, where the dead live.   
   
**Phantom:**   
&ndash;What are you going to do?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll send you flying.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'll crush you.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Just like that, Master! Here we go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Phantom:**   
Ugh! Still, my mission is accomplished. Though I shall never be rewarded, never.   
   
**Phantom:**   
This is where my song ends, but the real Hell starts now.   
   
**Phantom:**   
Rejoice, oh Holy Maiden! Your evil has grown even more than you.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;Be silent. It must be hard to even talk now.   
   
**Phantom:**   
These are not words. This is a song. To lament your future, and to mourn it.   
   
**Phantom:**   
Forget about the Dragon Slayer...Run to the ends of the earth.   
   
**Phantom:**   
If lady luck is on your side&ndash;you might just have a chance to escape.   
   
**Phantom:**   
Here it comes. The Dragon is here. The Devil is here. An evil dragon unlike any of you have seen before.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
You're a stubborn one, aren't you? The coda has ended, now back to hell with you.   
   
**Mash:**   
An evil...dragon?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Finally, I got through to you! Everyone, I recommend that we evacuate!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This reading is way beyond a Servant&ndash;It's indicating an "ultra-size lifeform. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's approaching with incredible speed!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Beyond a Servant! Can such a lifeform even exist in this world?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Of course they can! The world's a big place!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Um, sorry. Save the chatter for later! I am also detecting 3 Servants heading this way.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...It must be them. This is quite a problem.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
The orchestra is done. Let's get out of here. I know we just wasted our effort, but that's life.   
   
**Mash:**   
But...Wait, please.   
   
**Mash:**   
If the reading is truly beyond that of a Servant, then we need the "Dragon Slayer" more than ever.   
   
**Mash:**   
That person must be in this town, right? We can at least look for that Servant&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, no, no. No time, no time!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But if we abandon that Servant now, we may never get another chance!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, your orders!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Find the "Dragon Slayer".   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If we run here, things will get worse. Let's fight!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Amadeus, let's prepare for battle.... Will you fight with me?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Didn't you just order me to fight? You just need to stand proudly, and smile as always.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Don't worry yourself over me. If things get bad, I'll run away on my own!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes. That's the Amadeus I know. It's okay, we just have to buy some time.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I won't die. Not here, at least.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor! Are you detecting any other Servants?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Searching now. Hang on a moment!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&ndash;Right. There's a faint reading from the castle up ahead!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Let's go!   
   
## Section 8: Attack of the Giant Dragon   
   
**Mash:**   
...There you are!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
What a terrible wound!   
   
**G：???:**  
...Ugh!   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh!   
   
**G：???:**  
One after...Another.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Please wait! We are on your side! At least, we have no intention of causing you harm!   
   
**G：???:**  
???  
   
**Mash:**   
At any rate, please hurry! A dragon is approaching!   
   
**Mash:**   
Several Servants are with it, as well. We are at an overwhelming disadvantage here&ndash;  
   
**G：???:**  
A dragon, huh......I see.   
   
**G：???:**  
That's why I was summoned and then attacked.   
   
**Mash:**   
We will help you, let's get out of here!   
   
**G：???:**  
I'm sorry, I owe you one!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Hurry, Fujimaru! Even we can sense it approaching!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's within plain sight now! This is...No, it can't be!   
   
**Mash:**   
Wyverns can't compare to that thing. That's a real dragon!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...I was wondering what you found, turns out it's just another dying Servant.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Very well, you can all die together!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
It's attacking!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
No, get back, Maria! Your Noble Phantasm is useless here!   
   
**Mash:**   
I-I am going out!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't be ridiculous!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are you saying?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Mash, we'll do it together!   
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Incinerate them...Fafnir!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
"Luminosite&ndash;"  
   
**Mash:**   
Deploying Virtual Noble Phantasm!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
"Eternelle!! "  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Kya!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Whoa! What an immense amount of energy!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You all right!? Can you hear me?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...S-Say something!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Just shut up!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Please stop talking!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Ugh! Just as I thought, this is...  
   
**Mash:**   
I can't hold on anymore, it's no use!   
   
**G：???:**  
&ndash;No, looks like you made it. Thanks to you, my power's restored for a little.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Huh?   
   
**G：???:**  
&ndash;It's been a while Evil Dragon Fafnir. If you've resurrected, I will send you back to your slumber...  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Fafnir is trembling...That Servant, could it be&ndash;?   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Hear me, One Who Rules the Blue Sky! My name is Siegfried! He who once defeated thee!   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Noble Phantasm, Release! "Bal&ndash;mung! "  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Dammit! Fafnir, climb up now!   
   
**Siegfried:**   
...(pant, pant, pant)Sorry, this is the best I can do.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Get out of there, before they come back...  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Everyone, let's retreat while we can!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
It's dangerous. Considering what's to come,I can't exhaust Fafnir.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...If they use that sword again it may be a problem.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Berserker, Saber. That "Dragon Slayer" is the prize. Concentrate on getting him.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Berserk Assassin will be joining us soon. This time, finish them off for good.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I am not detecting the ultra-size lifeform anymore. But the enemies are still on our tails, hurry!   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, I want a horse!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Sorry, this is a one-seater!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
I'm used to traveling, but this is a first for me! This is just us retreating, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, don't fall behind!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry, but my leg...  
   
**Mash:**   
In that case, well!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's fight back.   
   
**Mash:**   
I suppose so, in that case...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Wait, please. I see something up ahead. That's the...French army!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
They're being attacked by the wyverns! We need to go help them!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, here they come!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ready to fight back!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'll just have to do it!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai! In for a penny, in for a pound!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
There are zombies heading this way, too. No problem, we'll just fight it out!   
   
**Mash:**   
Let's keep this battle going, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
I've disposed of the first wave of wyverns. Next up...  
   
**G：???:**  
A&mdash;Urrrrr!   
   
**H：???:**  
...  
   
**Amadeus:**   
...Damn you!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
&ndash;My, what a coincidence. I've never forgotten your face, you lazy artisan.   
   
**H：???:**  
That's good to hear. I've never forgotten yours either. Your face, and your pale white neck.   
   
**H：???:**  
At the same time, I feel like this is destiny. That you and I share a special connection.   
   
**H：???:**  
Don't we? The fate of a executioner killing the same person twice, I feel like only we share that kind of connection.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
...Not only in life, but even now you're eager to execute Maria?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Charles-Henri Sanson. Could it be that you are genuinely mad?   
   
**Sanson:**   
...As a human, it pains me to discuss our relationship with a low-life like you.   
   
**Sanson:**   
Amadeus, you claimed all lives, all humans, are filthy. Not I. Humans are sacred, precious things.   
   
**Sanson:**   
That's why we executioners respect life. We are incompatible, you and I.   
   
**Sanson:**   
Trash who couldn't even love humans, trash who couldn't understand her, has no right to be next to her.   
   
**G：???:**  
...Arrrrrrrrrrr!   
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh!   
   
**Mash:**   
What an attack! Master, please stand back!   
   
**Mash:**   
This Berserker...He's much more frightening than any Servant we've faced so far!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Look at the sky! Look how many wyverns are in flight!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Ugh! I'm going to help the French army! You two, take care of that Servant!   
   
**Sanson:**   
My sword of execution is pure.   
   
**Sanson:**   
It's not for the likes of you who do not submit to death, but...  
   
**Sanson:**   
Thinking of it, this entire nation is an execution site. Now, I shall remove your head with one strike!   
   
**???:**  
Arrrrrrrrrrrrr!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**???:**  
...Arrrrrrrrrr!   
   
**Sanson:**   
...Damn. What is with that Servant? I mean, that's beyond indestructible!   
   
**Mash:**   
Haaa...Ugh!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Sanson...What's the meaning of this...  
   
**Amadeus:**   
Dammit, now there are more wyverns, too! If only they'd focus on that crazy decapitating maniac!   
   
**Mash:**   
Where's Jeanne?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Run!   
   
**Soldier:**   
Wh-What?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Never mind, just make a run for it now! Do you want to die?   
   
**Commander:**   
D-Don't run! That's the Dragon Witch over there!   
   
**Commander:**   
Take her down! Avenge your hometown!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Ugh!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Wyvern. Start off by eating the soldier!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Aaaaarrrghhhhhhhh!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
(pant, pant, pant)...  
   
**C：Soldier:**   
H-Hey, isn't that the Dragon Witch?   
   
**C：Soldier:**   
Why is she fighting the dragons?   
   
**E：Soldier:**   
Don't ask me, but this is perfect. Let them both go down.   
   
**E：Soldier:**   
They burned my homeland to the ground. I hope both of them die!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
The people you're protecting are saying all kinds of things about you, my Saint.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Even though the only reason they can safely watch this is because you're dealing with the wyverns.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Please leave me be.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Heh, how stubborn. If you're worried about your lack of manpower, then by all means, why don't you ask the French army?   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Oh, forgive me. You're the "Dragon Witch" now, aren't you?   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
A saint cruelly burned to death and then resurrected for revenge.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
A beautiful, ephemeral, and ultimately ridiculous tale. And look, you're still struggling&ndash;  
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Because this time, they see you as the enemy!   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Can you tell me, Jeanne d'Arc? How do you feel right now?   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Do you wish to die? Or do you wish to kill?   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Do you long to drive that flag into those soldiers' hearts like a stake?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Normally, I'd fall into distress. I'd fall into despair.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But, unfortunately&ndash;I'm an optimist in life. Their hatred of me gives them the strength to rise.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
And that's a good thing.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
...Are you sane?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Good question. People questioned my sanity when I decided to bring salvation to France.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Yes. Whether light or dark, it just means both of us are insane!   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Wyvern!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Ugh!   
   
**F：???:**  
Artillery, FIRE!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Huh?   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Ugh!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Gilles!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Prioritize all surrounding dragons! Fire all cannons!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Now!   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Curse you!   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Heh&ndash;I expect nothing less from a Ruler. Even with your power stolen, your physical strength...  
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Retreat! Lancelot! Sanson!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Wait!   
   
**Lancelot:**   
...A...A&mdash;Urrrrrrr!!   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?   
   
**Sanson:**   
...It would seem that Jeanne d'Arc has touched the strings of his heart.   
   
**Sanson:**   
Now what, Carmilla? Will he even listen to reason?   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
...Retreat! We have no obligation to stay with a black knight that's lost his mind.   
   
**Berserk Assassin:**   
Lancelot! Buy us as much time as you can. Until the moment your life is extinguished!   
   
**Lancelot:**   
...Arrrrrrrrrrr!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Ugh! Why are you...  
   
**Mash:**   
W-We have to stop them! Master, it's a once in a lifetime chance!   
   
**Mash:**   
It breaks the code of chivalry, but we have to bring down Lancelot!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All right, let's do it!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's clearly no longer a knight!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Lancelot:**   
A-Arthur...  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Arthur? ...You mean your king, Arthur?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;Unfortunately, I am Jeanne d'Arc. I am not Arthur, the king you seek.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh, I see.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's wrong?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I know why Lancelot was so obsessed with Jeanne. She resembles Arthur, doesn't she?   
   
**Mash:**   
Not her face, but her soul&ndash;  
   
**Lancelot:**   
My...king...I...please...  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
Jeanne, let's go.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Yes!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Jeanne! Please wait! You are indeed Jeanne d'Arc!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Not the Dragon Witch, but a bona fide saint!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...Shouldn't you answer?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
If I answer, I will endanger Gilles's position. For now, we can't depend on them.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
At the very least, we must endure the scorn of those who once fought by our side.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
But...Do they really hate you?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;Let's go.   
   
**Commander:**   
General. What was that just now...  
   
**Gilles:**   
I don't know. I don't know, but...re-examine everything we know of the Dragon Witch.   
   
**Gilles:**   
Was it truly Jeanne d'Arc who attacked Charles VII? Or some evil imposter?   
   
**Gilles:**   
It's possible...That there may be two Jeanne d'Arcs in this world.   
   
## Section 9: Pause   
   
**Mash:**   
...It looks to be an abandoned fort. Let's rest here for now.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
How is Siegfried's wound?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
My Noble Phantasm can heal wounds, just a bit. But not this one, it seems.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
...It looks like some kind of curse.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Why were you in that city?   
   
**Siegfried:**   
It seems that I was summoned relatively early.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
I was drifting without a Master...That's when I saw the town being attacked.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
So you went to rescue them?   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Yes...Though it's not like when I was alive. Still, with Balmung, I managed somehow.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
When you're attacked by multiple Servants, it's not easy to pull off.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
...Then one of them hid me in the castle. My wound wouldn't heal, and I couldn't ask anyone for help either.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
I had no choice but to wait.   
   
**Mash:**   
Was it a woman who could control a dragon?   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Dragon? No, it was a turtle...No, a dragon...A dragon turtle...Now that you mention it, is it possible for that kind of dragon to exist?   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Oh. She had the aura of a Ruler, similar to what you have.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
It was St. Martha, I'd say.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
So that's St. Martha, the one who drove off the evil dragon Tarasque. I want to thank her&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I see, then never mind. I am sure she's prepared for the worst.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Still, I feel guilty that she saved me when I was useless.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Baptism Rites could probably remove this curse. But, a Servant of considerably high rank must perform it&ndash;  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Jeanne, you can do that, can't you?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...No. I tried, but my power alone isn't enough.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Multiple curses have been put on Siegfried.... It's a miracle he's even alive.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
We need another Saint to remove multiple curses at once.   
   
**Mash:**   
A Servant who was a saint...Hmm?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Yes, we do have a chance.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If St. Jeanne d'Arc...Sorry, Jeanne the "Dragon Witch" has the Holy Grail.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There is a possibility&ndash;that a Saint was summoned as the result of the Counter Force.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
St. Martha was actually summoned, right? Do you guys know any Saint Servants to ask?   
   
**Siegfried:**   
You're the only Servants that I've ever met.   
   
**Mash:**   
Jeanne and I don't know any other Servants beside the ones who became enemies.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...Staying together is probably safer, but maybe it be better if we split up?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Unless we remove the curses on "Dragon Slayer"Siegfried, we can't defeat Fafnir can we?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But...  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Jeanne?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Oh, well.... It's nothing.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
You are right. I think that's a reasonable idea. What do you think, Fujimaru?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's look for that Saint.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Break into teams and look around France.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
"Fortunately" may not be appropriate to say, but the French territories have already been reduced to less than half.   
   
**Mash:**   
Searching them should be easy. How to split up is the problem...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Whoa, I'm sorry to interrupt, but look at those wandering monsters.   
   
**Mash:**   
Wander...What?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Well, never mind. Anyway, we've got enemies. Let's deal with them now so we can continue our discussion.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I just had a great idea! Let's draw lots right now!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Excuse me?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
These things should be settled by drawing lots! Amadeus, please prepare some!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
You just want to draw lots, don't you? ...All right, all right, I'll make some. Let's split up based on that.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I am with, Marie.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Amadeus. Please look after Fujimaru and the others.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
To be honest, I'm nervous about leaving your side. Not that there's a time when I'm not nervous about you.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
...But lots are derived from fate. If I defy fate, I might invite misfortune.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Well, you can use your Noble Phantasm to escape, and Jeanne is a defense specialist.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
I'm rather worried about our side.   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash's skill is as good as hers.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Actually, Mash's is better.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master...Thank you!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Actually, what I meant was it's because we have Siegfried who's wounded.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Oh, well. I was taken advantage of.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Amadeus, make sure you get along with them. You tend to be misunderstood by friends.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
I don't want to hear it from you. Anyway, Maria...  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yeah?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Well, never mind. Just be careful along the way. Don't try to find a pastry shop even if you get hungry.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh! My heart beat thinking that you might propose to me again!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
&mdash;Wait. Why would you bring that up now?   
   
**Mash:**   
Propose? What? Marie? And Amadeus?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, you didn't know Mash? It's a pretty popular story.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
When Mr. Amadeus, standing right there, was 6 years old, he proposed to Marie who was 7 years old.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes, I reached out to him as he fell, then I saw him staring at me with his starry eyes&ndash;  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
"Thank you, nice lady. My name is Amadeus. "  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
"If a beautiful lady like you has no fiance yet, could I be the first one? "  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
He said that to me! I'd never been flattered like that since I was born!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Who knew the story would get passed down...this is a nightmare...  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Hehehe. Of course it would. I was so happy that I told everybody about it.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
So it was you! You did it! You turned me down! You're such a femme fatale!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I had no choice. After all, I couldn't decide who would be my fiance.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Besides&mdash;  
   
**Amadeus:**   
Besides?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
You know how my life was after that, don't you? I was happy with my decision. It was best to turn you down.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
It turned out that you were loved by many people as a musician. That's why I ended my life as a silly queen.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
It can't be helped you see, I have no choice because I'm always in love.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Maybe I was in love with a country named France. I only loved the country itself, not the people...  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Because I was such an arrogant woman, I ended up getting killed by the nation.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Marie, that's...  
   
**Amadeus:**   
...What is that? Are you a fool?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Am I?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Yes, you are. You've got it all wrong. You say you were in love with France?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
You're wrong. It's not that you were in love with the country. France was in love with you.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
&mdash;...Yes. Thank you, Mozart.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Wait. Isn't that strange? Doesn't that mean that I was killed by the people who loved me?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
That's right. That's how people are.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Love can easily turn to hatred. You were hated precisely because you were loved.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Hated because she was loved...They were in love, yet killed the one they loved...  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I see. People are complicated. Until I died, well, even after I died, I couldn't reach love.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
But I think I'm fine with it now.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I'm Marie Antoinette, a woman loved by France!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
See you, Amadeus! I'm leaving now! When I come back, let me listen to your piano again!   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, Jeanne. Let's keep in contact with each other at regular intervals.   
   
**Mash:**   
It's a Chaldean communication device. It allows communication via magical energy.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Very well. I'll hold onto it, then.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Take care.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Be careful.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Yes, thank you. Fujimaru, please take care as well.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Amadeus:**   
...What I just spoke about was out of line. Let's get going.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't you want to follow her?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you still love Marie?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Amadeus:**   
Certainly not. I have no more passion for her. She was just a special divergence in my fate.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
If I'd led a decent life, the divergence would've been that proposal.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Like what you'd call the cornerstone of human history.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
What choices would this man, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, have made to end up this way?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
No matter what happens. No matter what lovers I meet,what friends I gain, what bliss I grasp.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
I would offer my life to music, and become a scum that abandons all human virtue.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
But there's just one thing.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
If there were someone who could change my fate, I think it would've been her.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Amadeus. Doesn't that mean that you love Marie?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Oh, sure. I do love her. It's just that I'm not in love with her any more. Is there a problem with that.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I don't know. Before you said that we humans are filthy.   
   
**Mash:**   
Based on what you said, that means you think Marie is also filthy without exception...  
   
**Amadeus:**   
So what? I love anything filthy. Music is beautiful. We humans are filthy.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
You weren't aware of such differences? It's just a matter of category, isn't it?   
   
**Mash:**   
Well...what? You said that humans only love beautiful things...  
   
**Amadeus:**   
It's not that we can only love something beautiful. What I meant was humans can love beautiful things, too.   
   
**Mash:**   
Well...To me, that difference is too abstract...  
   
**Amadeus:**   
Hmm, I guess I can't make you understand it with words.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
You'll understand someday. You're going to continue your journey with Fujimaru, right?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Then you'll figure it out. When it comes to the topic of humanity, [♂ he /♀ she] is an ideal Senpai.   
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes! I can completely understand the "ideal Senpai" part!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Trust can be heavy sometimes.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
...Excuse me. I understand that you guys are talking about something nice, but...  
   
**Siegfried:**   
It seems enemies are coming. I'm sorry for being insensitive...  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...Fou, Fou!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&mdash;What! Darn! Sieg snatched what I was supposed to do!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But I hope you'll understand what made me drop my guard.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You know, I thought he was as much of a loser as me,but he's actually a great person with a deep view on life.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Don't worry about it, Doc. I feel sympathy for you too.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
We are basically good-for-nothing humans...Or adults, I should say.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, thanks Amadeus! I've never been this unhappy with words of comfort!   
   
**Mash:**   
Enough. Please monitor the battle!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
We're done here. Siegfried, are you all right?   
   
**Siegfried:**   
I've recovered enough to walk. Anything but combat should be fine.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
...I'm going to be making trouble for you a little longer. I'm sorry.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's regroup and set off! I'm going to put everything into detecting Servants!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Jeanne, Jeanne. You have a scary look on your face!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
What? ...D-Do I look scary?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Hehehe, not so much scary as...Stern?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Well...I guess so. I was doing some thinking.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
You mean about the Dragon Witch?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Yes. Exactly.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
From the day I was born I've received God's revelations, and I just ran off without even looking back.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I became a Heroic Spirit after I died, and then was summoned as a Ruler.... I accept this fact as part of the natural order of things.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I don't understand&ndash;anything the Dragon Witch says, not a single word.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I wonder...Who that "me" is.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
&ndash;Ah, you really are beautiful. Very, very, very&ndash;beautiful.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
D-Don't tease me.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Well, it's the truth. If I were you&ndash;  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I would probably accept the things the "Dragon Witch" says.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Marie?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I don't hate the people who executed me. It's a fact that I'm 90% positive about.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
But the 10% that's left...Or, it might be much smaller than that.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I hated those who killed my children&ndash;just for a little bit.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
!!!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
They killed my son Charles, to hurt me...You should truly feel pity for him.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
So, if my version of the Dragon Witch appears,I would probably think "oh, that's the other me. "  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
And accept the things she says.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
But that's not the case for you, is it Jeanne? It's something really great and beautiful.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
It's not because you don't want to get dirty, or don't want to believe you are. Nor does that mean you lack something.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
You like&ndash;people, don't you?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
People who try to move forward by groveling around. The unreasonable ones, the accusers.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Yes. I do love them. Oh I see, there was no way I could hold a grudge against them&ndash;because I loved them.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes. That's why France was saved by you.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
It's okay, tell the Dragon Witch when you see her.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Tell her? Well, tell her what?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Say what you want to say out loud.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Say, "You're not me. "Or, "I don't know you. "  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Marie...Well, you're right. Absolutely right.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I certainly&ndash;Oh, huh? ...Know you, maybe?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
You're starting to look serious again...I'm sorry, it wasn't of any help?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Y-Yes.... It was very helpful.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
When I confront her next time, I'm sure I can tell her what I want to say.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes, you should be fine. Oh, I think it's time to make our regular contact.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
That's right we should. Let's do that now&ndash;  
   
## Section 10: Saint   
   
**Mash:**   
Jeanne and the others will be arriving soon it seems.   
   
**Mash:**   
Let's do our best, too. We'll soon arrive in Thiers.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Thiers...If I recall, it's famous for its knives. So far it looks like it hasn't been destroyed.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, any signs of Servants?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm checking...All right, there are two Servants in Thiers.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's make contact right away&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
...Flame just went up in that town, didn't it?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
This noise...I hate it! An unprecedented noise, the premonition of an unprecedented demon!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Oh, Muses! Please show mercy! My body can't stop trembling from fear.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's hurry up.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's check it out.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
O-Okay! Everyone, follow me!   
   
**H：???:**  
You! You, you, you! You cheeky squirrel fom the East!   
   
**G：???:**  
Hehehe! Who's the actual cheeky one? Do you really think a failure like you can beat&ndash;  
   
**G：???:**  
A true Dragon like myself, Elisabeth?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Ughhhhh! I'm so upset! I'll deal with Carmilla later, you die first!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You creepy stalker!   
   
**G：???:**  
I'm not a stalker. I'm "a devoted bodyguard who acts like a spy. "  
   
**G：???:**  
I, Kiyohime, am a woman who lives for love.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Your love violates human rights!   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I don't want to hear it from a pervert with a fetish for blood torture.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I imagine that you were doing it...as doing THAT. Weren't you?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What's "doing it? " What's "doing that? "Don't talk nonsense!   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...What? Elisabeth, I didn't know that you were&ndash;  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Ahhhhhhh! Shut up, shut up, shut up! I'm going to&ndash;kill you!   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You can't kill me because I'll kill you!   
   
**Both:**   
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Enough! Stop right there! I can't let you go further. What you're doing is sacrilege against all of voice and sound!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are they saints?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They aren't saints, are they?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Amadeus:**   
No way! Religions would tumble if they're saints.   
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway, we have to stop them! Hey, you two!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? What?   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I'm busy right now. Come back the day before yesterday.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hmph. You'll no longer be busy soon. Until the next Holy Grail War that is!   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Hmph. Frilled-necked lizard.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Japanese Rat Snake!   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Mexican Bearded Lizard.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Sharp-Nosed Viper!   
   
**Mash:**   
Okay, stop!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Ahhh...My ears will rot...You scum...Oh no, I'm forbidden to say that. I promised Maria.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
By the way, Mash.   
   
**Mash:**   
What now?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
To our great joy, enemies are coming. For the sake of my ears, let's deal with them.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Black Mamba!   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Japanese Grass Lizard!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Let's go! By the time we come back,I am hoping they'll be done, too!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
More are coming! It's the wyverns this time!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No sign of any other Servants besides those two. Don't worry, go ahead and fight!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I am getting a powerful reading. Brace yourselves!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like the enemy assault has stopped...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Grr, grr, grr, grr, grr!   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
...Hmmmmmm.   
   
**Mash:**   
We can't let those two to fend for themselves, can we?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
...I can't. I've had it. I'm about to vomit. Yes, I'm leaving those people to you all...  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Since I am useless and can't fight, I won't say a thing.... Sorry.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Both of you, knock it off.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You shouldn't fight.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh?   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Did you just say something?   
   
**Mash:**   
Well, that you shouldn't fi&ndash;  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Back off, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Recklessness and bravery aren't the same. Are you stupid?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's better than reptiles.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's a mammal, at least.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
M-Master? Hey Master, aren't you a little upset?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Now I'm pissed.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You said it. You'll regret your words from the bottom of Hell.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Elisabeth, let's get started!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Fine! Just don't get cocky just because you beat some wimpy wyverns!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'll show you the terror that a Dragonkin can inflict!   
   
**Mash:**   
Did they just team up?   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Y-You got me...Ooooh.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
N-Not bad, you know...I'll let you call it a day now...  
   
**Mash:**   
Now that things have settled, I'd like to hear from you. Would you mind?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...What?   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I'm a loser snake, in other words, you're kicking a defeated snake when it's down?   
   
**Mash:**   
Loser snake? Um, have you ever seen any other Servants besides yourselves?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Well, I've seen crazy Servants. Like this one.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Would you mind not lumping me in with them? I'm a Berserker with my reasoning intact.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What's your problem?   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
What is it?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
...Oh, now I remember. When I was alive, I saw them often. Catfights! They were beyond loud.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Just you wait, in time they'll latch on to your head and make noises like, "gyaggggegggo! "  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I will not! But that's called shamisen right? Shamisen?   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I've said this many times, but would you not lump me in with them?   
   
**Mash:**   
Anyways! You haven't seen any Servants other than the "Dragon Witch" or Carmilla's group, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
Master...It looks like we've just wasted our time.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That sucks.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Elisabeth aside, treating me like that is a little bit rude, don't you think?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What a shame.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What's that about shame! You met ME, and it's a shame!?   
   
  
---  
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're looking for a saint.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're only interested in saints.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh. It takes guts to make that comeback...But in any case, a saint?   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I only know of one saint, if you mean someone whose teachings took root deep within this nation.   
   
**Mash:**   
Really?   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes. I met him before coming across Elisabeth.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I almost fought him, but he realized I was a "genuine"Berserker and he sheathed his sword.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
His True Name is Georgios. I believe he is quite a famous saint around here.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Georgios! The saint referred to as St. George.... Yes, he would be perfect.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Do you know where he went?   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
That's the real shame. He went the opposite direction as me, to the west.   
   
**Mash:**   
The west...That's where Jeanne and the others went. Commencing communication!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Yes, we're fine. We detected a Servant over here as well.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I'm about to make contact right now.   
   
**Georgios:**   
Please stop right there. Who are you?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I am a Servant. My class is Rider,but my True Name is Marie Antoinette.   
   
**Georgios:**   
...I see, you are not under Madness Enhancement.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes. I'm on the side opposing them, and this is&ndash;  
   
**Georgios:**   
I see...She is the holy maiden. Best we keep her name undisclosed.   
   
**Georgios:**   
This city has been razed by the Witch and her dragon. I was able to make them retreat, but that won't happen again.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Then, will you come join us?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Our "Dragon Slayer" is cursed, and we need to remove it immediately.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
However, multiple curses are entwined together, so both you and I must be present...  
   
**Georgios:**   
I understand the situation.   
   
**Georgios:**   
...The residents have already started to evacuations. Let us depart once that has completed.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Thank you very much!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Georgios:**   
A wyvern attack? There's been a lot of violence lately.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
No, that wasn't it. This sensation...It's the "Dragon Witch! "  
   
**Georgios:**   
What did you say?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Let's retreat, Georgios! We don't stand a chance against her right now!   
   
**Georgios:**   
...But we can't do that yet.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Oh...  
   
**Georgios:**   
The civilians aren't evacuated. The mayor has entrusted me with their protection.   
   
**Georgios:**   
I must fulfill that wish&ndash;Or else, I won't be able to stay a saint.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But...  
   
**Georgios:**   
...I know. If I stay, I will die.   
   
**Georgios:**   
But even so&ndash;I can't abandon them.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Lord Georgios, you are a man who is thick in head and body.   
   
**Georgios:**   
What was that?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
But, the part of you that is terribly cute has touched my heart.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
And so&mdash;Please allow me to take over that duty.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
What?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I am the Queen of France.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Even though that is in the "future" from here, for me neither "past" nor "present" make much difference.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Protecting the citizens is an important duty for me too, and you are now given a duty that can change everything.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
St. Georgios, go with Jeanne d'Arc and please lift the curse from the "Dragon Slayer. "  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
In the name of Marie Antoinette, I will make sure to protect this city.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
P-Please wait up! Wait, hey wait! Marie!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Marie, let us stay and fight with you! You can't do it alone, but I am sure the two of us can&mdash;  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Non. That makes me very happy, but you cannot, Jeanne.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I am sure I was summoned for precisely this moment.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Not to harbor hatred or defeat enemies, but to protect the people.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
So that at this time, I will protect those dear to me. To save my dear country, I will do what is right.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Oh, but please apologize to Amadeus for me. I never got to hear him play after all.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
He was 6, and I was 7. Since then, we've passed each other, but never met.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Marie!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Lord Georgios, do you agree to this arrangement?   
   
**Georgios:**   
...If you are fine with it, I will humbly yield this role to you.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Marie...  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Now go, Jeanne. As short as our time was, it was the greatest honor to fight under your flag.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Yes.... I will be waiting.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Don't worry, I'll catch up soon.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Sanson, you're here.   
   
**Sanson:**   
Of course I am. Execution needs qualifications. For both the executioner, and the executed.   
   
**Sanson:**   
No other person has the right to execute you. You should have realized that Marie.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...Let's see ...Hold on a second, Sanson. I know that you are a wonderful executioner.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I mean, you're cruel, merciliess, and inhuman, but you never once mocked criminals.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
You guarded the guillotine with great respect, so I do indeed trust you.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
But, does that mean you alone hold the right to kill me? Isn't that a bit absurd?   
   
**Sanson:**   
It's not absurd. I was born into a family of executioners, and I was only taught how to execute.   
   
**Sanson:**   
No compromise. It's not only about dedication,I am particular about the method&mdash;the technique.   
   
**Sanson:**   
It's natural for a good executioner to not inflict pain on the criminal. I see beyond that.   
   
**Sanson:**   
I see the&mdash;ecstasy. The moment it feels so good that "it will kill you. "  
   
**Sanson:**   
That is the type of beheading I dedicate myself to. The best slice of my life was my "kiss" for you.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...  
   
**Sanson:**   
So, this is destiny. I couldn't help but want to see you so I could ask...  
   
**Sanson:**   
Please, tell me, Marie.   
   
**Sanson:**   
How was my beheading? Were you able to climax at the very end?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...I can see that you seriously showed respect for me Sanson, from the bottom of your heart.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
But, I'm sorry. That's just impossible. It's something that I cannot possibly say...  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I already know enough men with perverse hobbies. Terribly sorry, but I can't accept a second kiss from you.   
   
**Sanson:**   
Yes, I know. But I'm sure you will be delighted,I've gotten even better than back then.   
   
**Sanson:**   
That is why I was summoned as a Servant. I shall give you the final ecstasy once again!   
   
**Mash:**   
If we hurry, we might still make it in time.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Right, if we lose them for the sake of my revival, that would be a great loss.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I have a reading...Unfortunately, an enemy. Please hurry and defeat it!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Full power.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Understood.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes Master! Now, please stand back!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Sanson:**   
That's, impossible! How could I be defeated?   
   
**Sanson:**   
I've killed so many since that day, and become so much stronger...So why?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
How sad, Charles-Henri Sanson. I should've told you when we reunited.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Our relationship ended that day.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Because your blade was truly&mdash;rusty.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
You've killed so many people that it's lost its way. You've increased your proficiency as a killer.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Executioners and killers are not the same, Sanson. The more skilled you become at killing others&mdash;  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
The rustier your blade as an executioner, savior of criminals, becomes.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
By the time you followed the Dragon Witch, you were no longer the Sanson I knew.   
   
**Sanson:**   
No...Lies! It cannot be! I kept my faith that you would come! That's why I kept honing my skills!   
   
**Sanson:**   
To see you, and behead you with more skill&mdash;Give you a much better ecstatic moment!   
   
**Sanson:**   
I thought that by doing so, you would surely forgive me!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...Geez. You really are a pitiful, adorable person. I don't hold a grudge against you.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
From the beginning, you never had the need to be forgiven by me.   
   
**Sanson:**   
Ah...aah, ah&mdash;  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...That makes three. It's ironic how the ones who show potential are the first to fall.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Yes. Perhaps the two vampires you loathe may be the last ones standing.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Good day, "Dragon Witch. "It seems you got here a little too late.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
"Myself" has already escaped. &ndash;How pitiful.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
No, that's not true. She left here embracing hope.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Just by gaining one Servant? How ridiculous.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Speaking of ridiculous, it's amazing that you are still here.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Are you intoxicated with the idea of saving these citizens?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You, the person killed by her citizens. A woman put to the guillotine, beheaded in ridicule!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
So disappointing. Witches don't understand such simple logic?   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
It's true that I was executed. There was ridicule, and there was disdain.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
However&ndash;that gives me no reason to murder them in return.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
I became a queen because the people asked me to. A queen cannot be without her people.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Thus, it was inevitable. If they don't want you,then you exit even if you don't want to.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
That is the destiny of those serving their country. I believe my execution led to my people's next smile.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
No matter when, viva la France! Stars glimmer, and that will do. That's all we need.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Now I am certain. Say&ndash;"Dragon Witch. "  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
"Who are you exactly? "  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Shut up!   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
&ndash;Deploy Noble Phantasm. "Crystal Palace!! "  
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
...Goodbye Jeanne, it was lovely meeting you.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
If I can help the Saint who saved France...No, if I can help a friend.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Then I will gladly shed the last of my radiance and fall.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
Like a star, like a flower. Like a fleeting dream.   
   
**Marie Antoinette:**   
That is what a Servant is,and how Marie Antoinette lives&ndash;!   
   
## Section 11: Baptism Rite   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Mash!   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, thank goodness! And who is&ndash;  
   
**Georgios:**   
My name is Georgios.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
...Where's Maria?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Marie is...  
   
**Amadeus:**   
I see. That's what she said when she stayed behind? Oh well, it can't be helped.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
You don't have to feel bad. Even if we were there,she would've done the same thing.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Maria is an eternal philanthropist. That's how she lives and dies.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
But never mind that, why don't you reverse Siegfried's curse?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
R-Right!   
   
**Mash:**   
Amadeus...  
   
**Amadeus:**   
It's all right, I knew this was going to happen. Remember how Maria was talking about the piano?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
See, that was her way of saying goodbye. It never happened when we were alive.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
If she'd said to me "Let me hear your piano,"I couldn't have stopped her.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
But, the second farewell hits hard. Worse than the first. All the more as we'll never meet again.   
   
**Mash:**   
Eh...Um, if you are Heroic Spirits, wouldn't there be a chance to see each other again?   
   
**Mash:**   
Like now, you may be called to the same battlefield...  
   
**Amadeus:**   
Mm, that won't happen, I think? There are as many Heroic Spirits as the stars.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
How I came across her this time was already a miracle. Though, a whimsical Master might change things a bit.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Anyway, I'm a bit tired. I'm going to excuse myself,call for me when you're ready to leave.   
   
**Mash:**   
Wait...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You shouldn't, Mash.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Stop Mash.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, but&ndash;  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It's fine. Everyone has moments where they want to be alone.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
That's right, Mash, you don't understand a man's heart quite yet.   
   
**Mash:**   
You're right. Now that aside...  
   
**Mash:**   
...Why are YOU here?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It's fine, isn't it?   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You don't approve of us being here? We're willing to assist you in combat.   
   
**Mash:**   
Well, that is something to be thankful for, but...  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
By the way, Master.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
ME?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Of course you. Though temporary, can you enter a contract with me?   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes, sticking out your pinky is enough.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
This is a pinky promise, if you lie, I'll make you swallow a thousand needles...  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
This completes the contract! Just so you know...I really will make you swallow a thousand needles if you lie.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Is that clear? Please take care of me from now on.   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, Jeanne's group seems to have succeeded in lifting Siegfried's curse!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Okay, you will be fine from now on. This would probably have been impossible by myself.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...It's all thanks to Marie. We were able to survive because of her.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
What she risked her life protecting is something I want to protect too.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
This era, this world, this country&ndash;To do so,let's defeat the "Dragon Witch" and, the dragon.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
&ndash;All right, I can move now. I apologize for all your efforts, Fujimaru.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
No, Master...The more correct way to put it is,I appreciate all your efforts from the bottom of my heart.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
I shall entrust my sword to you. This body will be my Master's sword and shield.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
My True Name is Siegfried. I have no other skill than slaying dragons, but I'd be honored to be put to use.   
   
**Mash:**   
That sound...It's the wyverns!   
   
**Siegfried:**   
...It looks like it's my turn already. Please command me.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I will leave them to you.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go get them.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Yeah. &ndash;My name is Siegfried, here I go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All right, now we have ourselves a team.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's right Master.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's attack Orleans.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's take down the dragon.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes! Understood Master!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Hmph. I wouldn't mind helping you out with that, little Puppy.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
My, my, Elisabeth, calling my Love a Puppy is an insult.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Did you just make a ridiculous word change? Well, I don't care.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'm not a cheap dragon. I will meet an extra-special Master someday!   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Oh, so the horn on your head isn't the only thing twisted. Seeking an impossible dream...Is your head okay?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It's not an impossible dream! It's conviction! I'm convinced of it!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'll someday meet a Master that is to my liking and will love me!   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Yes, yes, in your head it's another cloudless day.   
   
**Georgios:**   
...Our team sure is a lively one. Of course, I will be in your service.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Oh, heading out already? Then I'll tag along. I've come this far, might as well see the end.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Fujimaru. No, Master.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Right now, I am merely a powerless Servant.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But I wish to protect this world. Please, fight with me.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That is our duty.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Thank you so much!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Let's make camp here tonight to prepare for tomorrow's showdown...  
   
**Jeanne:**   
First, we'll have to secure the area. Everyone prepare for battle, we're surrounded.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Don't draw too much attention, and refrain from any flash attacks so we can end this soon...Wait.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Fujimaru,I don't see Mash or Amadeus anywhere...  
   
**Amadeus:**   
Well crap, I just came to get a bit of water. How unlucky of me to be assaulted by enemies.   
   
**Mash:**   
Amadeus, over here! I'll go up to the front line, so please hide behind me!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
I'd take up your offer...but I can't. This time the situation is different.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
I can't run away if the front line is just you, Mash. Let me fight with you.   
   
**Mash:**   
Amadeus? Will you be all right? You'll get hurt, you know!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Oh, it's a rehearsal to prepare for tomorrow's battle. A few wounds? No worries.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Amadeus:**   
Whew! We made it through in one piece, but we accidentally left the forest during the battle.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Fujimaru and Jeanne must be worried. Let's rest awhile, then return to camp.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Um. It seems a bit crazy to ask questions at a time like this, but do you mind?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Of course not. Be it important or trivial, ask away.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Tomorrow is the final battle. You should wrap up any unfinished business.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Right. I hate to bring this back up...  
   
**Mash:**   
But it's about when we heard that Marie had died. This is what you said, Amadeus.   
   
**Mash:**   
"Humans choose what they love. "I don't understand what that meant.   
   
**Mash:**   
Rather, I understand the meaning of the words,it's the "choose" part that I don't understand.   
   
**Mash:**   
I mean, things we should view favorably are morally just,and things we should reject are socially bad.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's what I was taught. I feel deep down that it's right.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Hmm. What do you consider right then?   
   
**Mash:**   
Well...Something that saves many lives, and sees value in many lives, I suppose.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
That's rather ill-defined. Let's assume for a moment that Fujimaru were not such a person. What then?   
   
**Mash:**   
But that's...  
   
**Amadeus:**   
Forgive me, that was a mean assumption. However, keep that hesitation and discomfort in mind.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Mash, I suspect that you are a person who has only recently gained her freedom.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
As such, you freeze in the face of hard choices and have doubts about the person you are becoming.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, I think you might be right. I, uh...didn't know much about the outside world.   
   
**Mash:**   
...No. Maybe I never had the right to care for anything in the first place.   
   
**Mash:**   
I mean, I&mdash;  
   
**Amadeus:**   
Oh, dear. You truly are pure, aren't you? You're like a music sheet without a single note on it.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
But heed my words, Mash. Even if you are a doll created for the sole purpose of fighting...  
   
**Amadeus:**   
...You have the obligation to care for something. You may not have freedom, but you have obligations.   
   
**Mash:**   
Obligations? Not rights or privileges?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
No, obligations. Or duties, if you like.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Humans have that responsibility, for they possess the intelligence to think.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
What to care for, what to dislike, what is considered precious, what is considered evil.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Those are the things you must choose for your self. Not by the words of others, nor by conforming to your environment.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Every human is unique. So too is each one's values.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
We learn and see as much as we can. By doing so, your life will be enriched.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Listen, the world is not what you make of it. You are what the world makes of you.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Then when you have become you, become more than this world.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
You must leave proof that you existed, whatever it is. I have. All the music I left behind is proof.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Even though&mdash;that itself is insignificant.   
   
**Mash:**   
???  
   
**Amadeus:**   
After all, I am a man who couldn't even bear witness to the death of his one and only first love.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
My legacy may have been loved by many, but my actual life was nothing special.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Still, I am content with that. Human beings are filthy and unpleasant. My conclusion stands.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
There are sinners who shine brilliantly and saints that make one retch. So there is no need for you to fear your own future.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
You are created by the world, and you expand and improve the world.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
That is what "being a human" is all about.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Begin by absorbing all you can from the world and then return those favors to the world as you see fit later.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Worrying over what results that will have is a matter for another day.   
   
**Mash:**   
Amadeus...  
   
**Amadeus:**   
However, most things in this world have a fair value, and a result fit for such value.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
As was the case with my music and my life.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
As long as humans are human, evil will not prevail. After all, humanity will be unable to flourish otherwise.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
It is said that "evil" is the hindrance to the prosperity of life. The species cannot survive with it there.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
If humanity cannot purge itself of that "evil," that is the day of humanity's extinction. It's that simple.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
...I see that you are now breathing more calmly. Our break is over Mash, let's return to the others.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Most likely this is the last time we shall chat. For some reason, it turned into a bit of a lecture.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Still, I'm happy that we were alone for this final talk. From start to finish, you're a charming young lady.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
In this battle, I would have proposed to you had Maria not been there.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I see. Thank you great composer Amadeus,I won't forget what you said.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Indeed. You pass, Mademoiselle.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
I want you to remember one last thing. There's nothing more beautiful than a parting smile.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Mash:**   
The supplies have arrived, but apparently there's been a shift in topological space.   
   
**Mash:**   
Our rations are being devoured by monsters. Senpai, are you okay with being hungry?   
   
**Mash:**   
...I suppose not. Let's go!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hey, I had my eye on that! Don't eat it!   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You are so annoying!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hey, that looks good.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Then allow me to feed you, say "ahhh. "  
   
**Mash:**   
...What's gotten into you?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
   
**Amadeus:**   
Hello, is this seat taken?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Oh, no! Be my guest.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
I'm sorry to be a bother while you're relaxing, but those dragons over there are too noisy.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
......Amadeus. Marie was very kind to me.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
But of course. She was kind to everyone, but her affection for you was unique.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Why do you suppose that was? Because I'm a fellow Frenchwoman?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
I'm not sure. I don't think it had anything to do with you being French.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Whether one is from England, Spain, or the Far East, that is of no importance to Maria.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
The reason she was fond of you, that she held you in high esteem, was because you were a young woman who took a stand all on her own.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
In a sense, Maria is the same. She became a queen at 14 and was forced into battle all alone in Versailles.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
...Of course, I'm sure that her battles paled in comparison to yours.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Battlefields with cannonballs and conspiracies are in truth, fundamentally different.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Nevertheless, it was indeed a life or death struggle for her. That is why she empathized with you.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Because she was living through a lonely battle of her own?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
And one other reason. This is the important one.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
For Maria, standing up for a loved one is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Be it family, another person, a Servant&ndash;or even the nation itself.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
True, she was a sheltered girl who knew no hardship, so her way of standing up for someone was rather off-key.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Oh, is that so? In that case, I wanted to stand up for her as a friend.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Given the situation, nothing could've been done,but I wish&ndash;I could've been by her side.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...I like to believe so.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
A friend, eh? Yes, you thinking of her that way would be the ultimate reward for her.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Maria and I have one thing in common. We were not blessed with friends.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
But, her wish was fulfilled in this second life. I get the feeling she was able to move on with a light heart.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Um...Actually, I think of you as a comrade. Fujimaru feels the same too.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
No, no, that won't do. After all, I don't think that of you. Maria said it, remember? I'm fundamentally trash.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
I only love music. That is how I lived my life, and I am proud of that fact.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
That is why I cannot make friends. Instead, I left behind many pieces of music.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
If I had any desire for human happiness, I would vanish in a cloud of self-hatred.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Still, thank you Jeanne d'Arc. I'm sure that Maria had no regrets.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I shall avenge her.... No, vengeance isn't important, is it?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I will make her wish come true. I will save this France.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Gilles, are you here?   
   
**Gilles:**   
Yes, right here!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Marie Antoinette has perished, but what about Sanson?   
   
**Gilles:**   
I am treating him right now. His mind perished with her.   
   
**Gilles:**   
All we can do is to keep his Spiritron Shell intact, and use him as a foot soldier.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...I see. Georgios escaped from that town.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Had Marie not sacrificed herself to buy time, our plan would have worked&ndash;  
   
**Gilles:**   
Ah, I see. The enemy ranks lost one, but also gained one.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
We're not at a disadvantage here, but it is a nuisance. Continue searching for them&ndash;  
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
It doesn't look like that will be necessary.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Saber? I thought I ordered you to search the southeastern region.   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
There's no longer any need, Master. They're heading straight for Orleans.   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
Looks like it's a final showdown they want. Don't you want the same thing?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...So, they've stopped running around have they? Which means they think they have a shot at winning.   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
I suppose they do. They have many Servants as well.   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
We might have dragons on our side, but this should still be a glorious fight.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
You're enjoying yourself?   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
Of course. As you know, I'm not right in the head. I'll be just as happy with wiping them out as being wiped out by them.   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
Go on, order me&ndash;Master.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Prepare for the final battle. Gilles, summon them, not just the Servants.   
   
**Gilles:**   
Understood. I shall gather all the dragons who were slain in France.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...If we win, the world will be destroyed. Even if we lose, it will make no difference.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
The world is long gone. Even if they correct this place, an endless journey lies ahead.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
And yet...And yet, they have faith in the world&ndash;Those people, and "me. "  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
In that case, I shall smite them. I won't let them reconnect this world.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That is my wish, and Gilles' wish.... Yes, that should be my wish&mdash;  
   
**--ARROW--**  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Siegfried:**   
I seem to be the only one here with experience leading an army.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Of course, it's not as if I have a glorious military record where I led an army to invade a worthwhile country.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
In any event, our numbers are few while the enemy's are large.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
...But, most of the enemy's forces are weaker than us. In situations like this, there are two options.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
A frontal assault, or an ambush from the rear. However, our location was given away long ago.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Stealth is out of the question. The enemy knows where we are...There's only one option.   
   
**Both:**   
A frontal assault.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
...Exactly.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Master and I will see to Fafnir.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
I want the others to protect us from Servants and wyverns.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Whether we slay Fafnir or not, the outcome of this war hinges on that question.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Understood. I'm inexperienced, but I'll fight with everything I have.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh Puppy, there is someone I must fight.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Would it be all right if I focus on her.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Go ahead.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh? Thanks.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who do you want to fight?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh, a Servant I share a certain fate with.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
If I can do that, I'll be quite satisfied.... I'll lend you a hand if I can spare the time.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I, without a doubt, will be facing the "Dragon Witch" in battle.   
   
**Georgios:**   
Can you defeat her?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Yes, I shall be victorious.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Even if she turns out to be the real Jeanne d'Arc, I will still prevail in battle.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Hm, I don't have an issue with anybody. I guess I will just try to get wyverns' attention.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
In that case...I shall be at our Master's side and breathe fire as needed.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
As they say, like moths to the flame, and scoundrels of dubious origin who stand in the way of romance.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Leave scouting the area to me.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is do-or-die time. I've got lots of energy drinks and buckets ready!   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, those have the opposite effect. They cause stomachaches, so maybe you shouldn't drink them...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I am sure it will freshen me up if I dunk my face in it. Anyway, leave everything to me!   
   
**Siegfried:**   
So, if no one has any questions...Master&ndash;please issue your orders.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's fight!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's win!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Right! Now, on to Orleans&mdash;!   
   
## Section 12: March to the Orleans   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...As predicted it's swarming with wyverns. Still, we can't afford any delays.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Everyone, take care of them as fast as you can.   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood! Master, the enemies are coming, give me your orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Amadeus:**   
They're still coming!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Servant detected! They're coming straight for you&mdash;It's our enemies!   
   
**Berserk Archer:**   
...I'll kill you...I'll kill you all! Every last one of you, shatter before my bow!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Archer...She's been forced under Madness Enhancement as well!   
   
**Georgios:**   
She must be the type of Servant who'd never serve the Dragon Witch.   
   
**Mash:**   
It can't be helped! I'm taking her out!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Berserk Archer:**   
...This is fine. This is fine. Really, what a troublesome and unrewarding job.   
   
**Berserk Archer:**   
Go, and take down that dragon. Yes, next time for sure, I&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Berserk Archer's elimination is confirmed. I am getting a reading of a ultra-size lifeform!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fafnir's left Orleans. In other words...The showdown's about to begin!   
   
## Section 13: Jeanne and Jeanne   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hello, trash I left behind.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...No, I am a vestige. Most importantly, I'm not you Dragon Witch.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
But you are me. What are you talking about?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...No matter what I say, I can no longer reach you.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
After this battle is over, I'm going to give you an earful!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Silence! Behold these dragons! Behold this horde of dragons!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
We have turned this nation into a nest of dragons!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
They will devour everything, and nothing will ever live in France again!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Then this world will be complete. Then this world will be destroyed.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
The dragons will fight one another for eternity. Endless war. Endless devouring.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That will be the true Hundred Years' War&ndash;A Hundred Years War of Evil Dragons!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
What!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Gilles!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Fire! We fight for the survival of France! Fire everything we have! Fire! Fire!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Do not be afraid! Do not sorrow! Do not falter! If you have human blood, now is the time to die!   
   
**Gilles:**   
I will say it again! There is nothing to fear! For we&ndash;  
   
**Gilles:**   
"For we have the Saint on our side! "  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Gilles!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Hmph, such stubborn belief. It makes me want to vomit. Fafnir!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Incinerate that Saint, that army, this nation! Burn everything to the ground!   
   
**Siegfried:**   
&ndash;Hah. I never thought I'd see you a third time.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Perhaps, in another time or another world, we could've been connected in another way&ndash;  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Siegfried!   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Fafnir! I am here wicked dragon! I, Siegfried, am right here!   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Once again, you shall taste the twilight. I swear by my righteousness, and by my beliefs&ndash;!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Come forth my Servants!   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
Hey you guys, good to see you doing well!   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
I am Chevalier d'Eon. This time I lend my blade to evil&ndash;but it remains as pure as ever.   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
Now, fight me with all you have! End this nightmare!   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
...So you came, huh? There's no shame becoming fallen.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
Defeat is the greatest shame of all. I've become a mere puppet in the search for the Grail&ndash;  
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
I am praised as the immortal vampire.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
Fiction or not, it is all I have left.   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, they're coming! The French army is holding off the wyverns!   
   
**Mash:**   
This is it!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm counting on you, Mash!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's do it, Mash!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right! We'll achieve victory together!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
...We've lost. Now my curse will be broken.   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
Thank you all. Apologies to my beloved queen.   
   
**Berserk Saber:**   
I'm so sorry, my queen. Please forgive my mistake&ndash;  
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
&ndash;Is it over now? My dreams, my ambitions will once again be erased?   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
Hmph, who knew I'd deal with a "Dragon Slayer" again? How ironic.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
I see. So they were right, I am Dracul, the devil.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
It must be my destiny to fall in the presence of a Servant who slew devils and dragons.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
Very well, I will allow it. You, the Master over there.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
You are a [♂ man /♀ woman] who does not lose sight of themselves amidst the battle. Next time, summon me.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
Then I will show you the true power of my lance.   
   
**Berserk Lancer:**   
The lance that defended a nation&mdash;the weapons that defended my people...In your hands, they will shine&mdash;  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Mash:**   
(pant, pant, pant)...  
   
**Sanson:**   
Ahhh...Augh...augh!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
I can't believe this, I was here fighting random enemies and the one I despise the most showed up.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Hey executioner, from the looks of it I guess Maria turned you down?   
   
**Sanson:**   
Ama...deus? Aaaaamaaaaaadeeeeeeuuuuuus!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Mmm, why are you so fired up? Don't tell me Maria said something she shouldn't have.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
For example, maybe&mdash; Although we are both scum,she said I am 100 times better. Something like that?   
   
**Sanson:**   
Hah&mdash;Ah, ah&mdash;Shu&mdash;t up. Shut up, Amadeus!   
   
**Sanson:**   
I won't let you beat me! You're the one man I'll never lose to!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
...Whoa! Wait, did that give him back his sanity?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Jeez...I guess I should've kept my mouth shut. But&mdash;this makes things worth doing.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Charles-Henri Sanson, are you ready for me to take my frustration out on you?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
I've actually got some energy for once. Enough energy to play an extra song on the piano.   
   
**Sanson:**   
Whatever, I'll chop you fingers off. You know something, Amadeus?   
   
**Sanson:**   
I always hated your Requiem! The way it turned death into mere music!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Tsk, this is the problem with gloomy muscleheads! Damn, his intensity's overwhelming!   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Sorry, help me out Master! This is my last gift for Maria, let me make it a good one!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Sanson:**   
Ha&mdash;I see. So I'm going down to you?   
   
**Sanson:**   
Then...The evil one is me, no question about it. Justice is on your side.   
   
**Sanson:**   
Just like last time, the queen smiled&ndash;as she took in the witch's flames.   
   
**Sanson:**   
Not with resignation, but with hope.... May blessings be upon you.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
You idiot, you actually cared whose side justice is on?   
   
**Amadeus:**   
...How gloomy. This is why we need to get rid of jobs where you do nothing but kill people all day.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Bye Sanson, next time I see you I'll play my Requiem until you're sick of it.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
I mean, you're actually a huge fan of the song aren't you?   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Why, you! Why you, why you, why you!   
   
**Carmilla:**   
This is...quite irritating. This "me. "  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Right back at you! How did you get to be a Servant?   
   
**Carmilla:**   
Never thought you'd say that. From where I sit,it's far more maddening to see that I've become a Servant as myself!   
   
**Carmilla:**   
I'm a revered countess, feared by all. The finished product.   
   
**Carmilla:**   
I'm not like an unfinished product like you. I devoured fear and became an Anti-Hero.   
   
**Carmilla:**   
But what about you?   
   
**Carmilla:**   
You devoured the existence that is me. You simply refused to age, and feared being sealed away.   
   
**Carmilla:**   
Of course you did. From your perspective, I'm just a sign of your sin.   
   
**Carmilla:**   
The guilt you brought upon yourself, the unassailable record of your murders!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...That's right.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You are who I really am, my final destination. The symbol of my sin, that no tears will ever change.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Denying you means looking away from the crimes I've committed.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
But that doesn't mean I can't take responsibility! It may be ugly self-deception, but I'll say it anyway!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I...I don't want to be like you!   
   
**Carmilla:**   
How foolish, we're spirits of the past. The future's already been decided.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I know that! But I'm saying it anyway!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Help me, Little Puppy!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You may be a step down from the Master I dream of, but you're still first rate!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Please let me settle things with her! Let me sing with everything I have!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Carmilla:**   
The future doesn't reject the past, but rather, the past rejects the future?   
   
**Carmilla:**   
&ndash;Such drivel coming out of your mouth! But that's why...You're so dazzling, it's annoying.   
   
**Carmilla:**   
Let me return to the darkness. That last instant...That light&mdash;that I saw between the bricks.   
   
**Carmilla:**   
That's right...Whether I live or die,I&mdash;am always alone&mdash;  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Farewell, my future. Farewell, the part of myself so sad I had to separate.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
This will not lessen my sins, nor the fear others feel towards me.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I&ndash;will deny the future as many times as I must,and sing as many times as I must.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Siegfried:**   
After multiple obstacles, we're finally here.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
...Good work, Master. And Mash Kyrielight.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
We're almost at the evil dragon. Confronting it like this&mdash;I must confess.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
I don't know how I won the first time.   
   
**Mash:**   
Hey! Don't say stuff like that now!   
   
**Siegfried:**   
There's just one thing inscribed in my memory.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
My victory was not a certain one. It was a single, tiny sliver of a chance, surrounded by a million defeats.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Plan carefully, move boldly, keep a broad perspective,and focus deeply upon a single point.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Be like the sea, the sky, the darkness, the light. Contradict thyself.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Unless you do that, there is no way you can defeat Fafnir.   
   
**Mash:**   
I-I understand! I'll do what I can!   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Oh, Master.... Are you ready?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Of course!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Siegfried:**   
Heh. It's an honor to have such a bold Master.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Return to earth once more, wicked dragon!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Impossible!   
   
**Mash:**   
...We've defeated it!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Confirming Fafnir's complete silence! Amazing, a new Dragon Slayer has been born!   
   
**Mash:**   
Look! The wyverns are in a panic!   
   
**Siegfried:**   
They must be confused because Fafnir, their commander, got taken out.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Ugh!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Come back, Jeanne!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Gilles!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Gilles?   
   
**Gilles:**   
First, let's get back to this prison castle! We need to regroup.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Understood.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Wait!   
   
## Section 14: Chase After Jeanne Alter   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I'm off to settle the score with the "Dragon Witch. "  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, we'll head out there too.   
   
**Mash:**   
We should leave this place to the other Servants, and track the "Dragon Witch! "  
   
**Siegfried:**   
You're right, let me handle this. Take Kiyohime and Elisabeth with you.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Very well. I look forward to working with you, Master.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's fine, but...Why us?   
   
**Siegfried:**   
(Her Noble Phantasm hurts my ears...)(And Kiyohime breathes fire on anyone, friend or foe...)  
   
**Georgios:**   
(Both of their Noble Phantasms...)  
   
**Amadeus:**   
(Elisabeth's is the worst Noble Phantasm in the world, I'm sure of it. )  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
???  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Huh?   
   
**Mash:**   
Ahem. L-Let's go, you two!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Fafnir has fallen. Without it, the other wyverns...  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I'm aware. Let us summon a new Servant.   
   
**Gilles:**   
Indeed!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Gilles, defend me while I focus on the summoning. I'm counting on you.   
   
**Gilles:**   
Understood. I'll use my Noble Phantasm, Prelati's Spellbook, to buy us time.   
   
**Gilles:**   
Use that time to summon us a powerful Servant.   
   
**Gilles:**   
Perhaps King Arthur?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I can't imagine an English knight answering my summons...But I'll see what I can do.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Good luck.   
   
**Gilles:**   
Indeed Jeanne, I pray that the light of your glory is not tainted.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Let us hurry! If we're too slow, she'll summon another Servant!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I-I know that! But you know, this castle's kind of nice...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It's kind of my style, you know?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, it's terrible!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah, it's awful!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Indeed, all this blood. They don't organize, they don't clean...how filthy.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Only a bloodthirsty barbarian would prefer a place like this.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Y-You're right! This is bad, isn't it!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, enemies! Let's finish them quickly!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Whoops, there's a Servant up ahead! Be careful!   
   
**Gilles:**   
&ndash;Well, well, long time no see.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Gilles!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Who knew you'd defeat Fafnir, and show yourself here in Orleans...  
   
**Gilles:**   
To be honest, I am impressed.   
   
**Gilles:**   
However! However! Oh, my saint! And your comrades!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Why do you stand in my way?   
   
**Gilles:**   
You come into my world destroying everything, and now you're even trying to kill Jeanne d'Arc!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;I had a question about that.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Gilles de Rais, is she really "me? "  
   
**Gilles:**   
...What? What-what-what unforgivable blasphemy! Even the Saint would despair and rage to hear such a thing!   
   
**Gilles:**   
That is, without a doubt, the true Jeanne d'Arc. It is the darkness hidden within her!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;I see. Then as the light, I must face her.   
   
**Gilles:**   
Jeanne, I won't let anyone stop me&ndash;even you!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
We can handle this!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But their numbers are great...Why you!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Never mind that, what's with this giant starfish? Oh gross, this weird liquid is dripping onto my clothes! Dripping!   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
So filthy. Master, please protect me.   
   
**Mash:**   
D-Do your job as a Servant, okay?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? This roar...  
   
**Mash:**   
Enemy sighted! This time it's a wyvern?   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Jeez. How'd it fit inside this tiny castle?   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Gilles:**   
Curse you, curse you, curse you! In that case, take me on!   
   
**Gilles:**   
My comrade Prelati...Grant me your power!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Gilles...I shall release your soul!   
   
**Mash:**   
Let's go! Master, your orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Gilles:**   
...Ugh!   
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh! As powerful as expected...I couldn't finish him off!   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
We'll hold off this Servant! Master, you go on ahead!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Right, go settle the score with the last boss!   
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you for your support! Jeanne!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jeanne!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's wrong?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jeanne:**   
...I-I'm sorry. It's nothing.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I'm going. Thank you both!   
   
## Section 15: The Dragon Witch   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
Jeanne, what was bothering you just now?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Oh no, there was something on my mind...It's nothing important.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Anyway, it's time to confront the "Dragon Witch. "There shouldn't be anything in our way.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Let's go!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...That was faster than I thought. I don't have time to modify the spell&ndash;  
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;"Dragon Witch. "  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
So you finally made it here, huh? Gilles is&ndash;alive, but delayed.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I suppose that's fine. Everything is ready.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Tell her what she needs to hear.... That was Marie's instruction to me.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I have another thing to ask of you as well.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
It's too late for talking&ndash;  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It's a very simple question. Do you remember your family?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
...Huh?   
   
**Mash:**   
Jeanne?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I asked you a simple question.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
No matter how vivid my memories of battle are,I remember far more of my life as a simple country girl.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Even my dark side should remember those peaceful days.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
No, it's precisely because she remembers them&ndash;that the hatred and betrayal brought her such pain.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I...I...  
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;You don't remember, do you?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
What...What does it matter?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Whether I remember or not, I'm still Jeanne d'Arc!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
That's right. It doesn't matter whether you remember.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But this settles it. I shall defeat the "Dragon Witch" with sadness, not anger.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
&ndash;My Servants!   
   
**Mash:**   
These are...The Servants we saw in Fuyuki! And so many of them!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
I didn't have time to summon a normal Servant, but I can summon as many of these as I like.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Crush them!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, they're coming!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's do this, Mash!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Ugh...So they broke through that swarm?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
We're going to settle this right now. "Dragon Witch"&ndash;  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Shut up! Let's fight! Will despair win, or will hope win&ndash;  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Will murderous intent win, or will pity win? Let's see if you can surpass me&ndash;Jeanne d'Arc!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
What?   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Im-Impossible. Ridiculous. This can't be happening. It's a lie.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Because I&ndash;have the Holy Grail&ndash;! The owner of the Holy Grail knows no defeat.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
That's how it should be!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Oh, Jeanne! Jeanne! What a pitiful sight you are!   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Gilles...  
   
**Gilles:**   
But now that I, Gilles de Rais, am here you can rest.   
   
**Gilles:**   
Now then, sleep in peace.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
But&ndash;I still haven't...I haven't destroyed France...  
   
**Gilles:**   
I will take care of that. Leave everything to me.   
   
**Gilles:**   
Don't worry. You will never die. You're just a little...a little tired.   
   
**Gilles:**   
Close your eyes, and rest. When you awake, I'll have finished everything.   
   
**Jeanne Alter:**   
Yes, yes you're right. Gilles...If you'll fight for me, I can rest, and...  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Gilles:**   
...  
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;So that's how it ended up, after all.   
   
**Gilles:**   
You have a powerful intuition.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh, there she is!   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
To think that you'd make a sudden run for it...  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, Jeanne? What exactly&ndash;  
   
**Jeanne:**   
It wasn't the "Dragon Witch" who possessed the Holy Grail.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
No, actually that Servant, never existed in the Throne of Heroes.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
As long as she wasn't an aspect of my darkness, there was no other conclusion I could make.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Then how did she acquire that massive strength?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
That couldn't have been anything but the Holy Grail. In other words, the Dragon Witch herself&ndash;  
   
**Gilles:**   
Exactly. The Dragon Witch herself was my wish.   
   
**Gilles:**   
In other words, the Holy Grail itself.   
   
**Mash:**   
What?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? The dragon's the Holy Grail? Then me, too?   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
You dragon-dummy, Jeanne d'Arc didn't use the Grail for evil.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
You&ndash;created Jeanne d'Arc with the power of the Grail, didn't you?   
   
**Gilles:**   
My wish was to revive you. It was a wish from my heart,from the bottom of my heart. Of course it was.   
   
**Gilles:**   
...But the Grail rejected me. For all its omnipotent power, it said it couldn't do that!   
   
**Gilles:**   
But my wish was only for you! So I created a new you!   
   
**Gilles:**   
The Saint I believed in! The Saint I longed for! I created her!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Jeanne d'Arc&ndash;the Dragon Witch. The Grail itself!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...I see. But of course, she never learned that did she?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Gilles, even if you could revive me, I would never become your Dragon Witch.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
It's true that I was betrayed, it's true that I was mocked.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
It could only be described&ndash;as a tragic end.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But I could never hate my homeland. This is where you and the others lived.   
   
**Gilles:**   
...So kind. Your words are far too kind. However, Jeanne...  
   
**Gilles:**   
Your kindness has made you forget one thing. Even if you never hated this country&ndash;  
   
**Gilles:**   
I HATED THIS COUNTRY! I swore I would destroy it for its betrayal!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Gilles...  
   
**Gilles:**   
You will forgive them I'm sure. But I never will! Not God! Not the King! Not the nation!   
   
**Gilles:**   
I'll destroy them all. I'll kill them all. That is the wish I made upon the Grail!   
   
**Gilles:**   
DO NOT GET IN MY WAY, JEANNE D'ARC!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Yes, you're right. You're absolutely right.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
It makes perfect sense for you to hate, and for you to use the Grail's power to destroy France.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
And I&ndash;I will stop you. As a Ruler, the judge of the Holy Grail War.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I will stand in your way Gilles de Rais!   
   
**Gilles:**   
Then you are my enemy now.   
   
**Gilles:**   
Let us finish this Jeanne d'Arc, savior of France&mdash;!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Let us indeed!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, I've confirmed the presence of the Grail. Your orders!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This is the last battle.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Get ready.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right! Moving to recover the Grail! Mash Kyrielight&ndash;here I go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Gilles:**   
Not, possible! Even with the power of the Grail, I still...fell...  
   
**Gilles:**   
That's not possible! Such nonsense can't be true! I-I am still...  
   
**Jeanne:**   
Gilles. Enough.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Get some rest. You did such a good job.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Believing in a little girl who had no clue, you even liberated this town.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...No matter who you are now, I believe in who you were back then.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Don't worry. Until the very end, I have no regrets.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
My death will light the way for someone else. That's all I ever wanted.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Now let's go back to the time where we belong.   
   
**Gilles:**   
...Jeanne. I'm the only one of us who should go to Hell&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Grail recovery is complete! The timeline restoration is about to start!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Rayshift preparations are ready! Get back here, now!   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood Doctor!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
You're leaving? So soon?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I have work to do.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I have to go.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh do you? Hmmph...Well, I've achieved my goal, so I suppose it's fine.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Goodbye Little Puppy, you fought fairly well.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
&ndash;Oh my, this is goodbye? Don't worry Master.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
I can be rather persistent. No matter where you go, I'll follow.   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
That's what love is, after all.... You know?   
   
**Kiyohime:**   
Farewell.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
...It seems that everything is over. The wyverns are disappearing.   
   
**Georgios:**   
This wasn't exactly a normal Holy Grail War. But still, it was an honor to fight with the Dragon Slayer.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
I never thought I'd get a chance to fight with the famous St. George.   
   
**Georgios:**   
But from the look of things, it won't be long before we're summoned again.   
   
**Siegfried:**   
Yes, that Master's journey seems to be a long one. I hope we can aid them again&ndash;  
   
**Amadeus:**   
My role is finally over, huh? I'm so tired. I worked so hard my butt hurts.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
...Oh, I'm not supposed to make those sort of jokes. Sorry.   
   
**Amadeus:**   
Excellent conducting nonetheless, Fujimaru. A masterful performance all around.   
   
**G：Gilles:**   
Jeanne!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Gilles!   
   
**G：Gilles:**   
What happened? Wait, you're alive?   
   
**G：Gilles:**   
France is in ruins, but...If you're alive, that's enough!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...No, that's not true.   
   
**G：Gilles:**   
What&ndash;?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I'm sure on some level you understand. This world is nothing but an ephemeral dream.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I died, and you&ndash;sorrowed. That is history. That is unchangeable fate.   
   
**G：Gilles:**   
Jeanne...  
   
**Jeanne:**   
But in a different form, in a different way, we'll be able to fight together...I can feel it.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
So this is but a temporary goodbye.   
   
**G：Gilles:**   
You truly are...No, even in death, you still care for this country...  
   
**G：Gilles:**   
Forgive us, Jeanne d'Arc! We...France betrayed you!   
   
**G：Gilles:**   
Ooooohh!   
   
**Jeanne:**   
It's all right. Let's at least leave this world with a smile.   
   
**Mash:**   
Master...It's time.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Master and Mash.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
I expect that my meeting with you Mash,and Fujimaru, our battles, even the lives we lost...  
   
**Jeanne:**   
All of this will disappear, won't it? That makes me a little sad.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
...Of course, it's a joyous thing that lives lost will return to us.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
But I feel like I'll meet you again somewhere. My intuition can be pretty good, you know?   
   
**Jeanne:**   
&ndash;Farewell. And thank you.   
   
**Jeanne:**   
Even if all this disappears beyond the void, I'm sure something will&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Welcome back Mash, Fujimaru! Good work!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Thanks to you, the first Grand Order was completed successfully.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&mdash;Yes, excellent job. We had few supplies, no personnel...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...and the Rayshift was still at an experimental stage, yet you both did such a fine job.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I say this on behalf of all surviving members of Chaldea...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You are now full-grown Mages, and Chaldea is very proud of you!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Fooou!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Fou made it back too. Are we sure it's not a lucky animal of some sort?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, welcome back. You guys look tired.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Here's your latest observation records. Take a look, Doctor.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hm...Oooohh!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We did it! 15th century France is restored completely! Still six to go, but&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Part of human history is in its rightful place! We did it, Fujimaru!   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. But Doctor&ndash;we never saw Lev Lainur.   
   
**Mash:**   
He was not in France?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, he's probably hiding in one of the other 6 eras.... No, I guess he wouldn't hide.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He has more than enough power. If he's in the same time as us, he'll act.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I'm sure we'll see him eventually. Until then, we need to get stronger.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, details like that don't matter!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's the end of our mission for today!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I bet you want a warm bed and a shower, right? Go back to your room and rest.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, that plan sounds absolutely wonderful. See you later Doctor.   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, and Senpai...  
   
**Mash:**   
Good work today. Let's get back to it tomorrow!

**Fujimaru 1:**   
You too Mash.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, thank you.   
   
**Mash:**   
Once again, I wasn't able to help you at all...  
   
**Mash:**   
But I'm finally starting to think I can do this.   
   
**Mash:**   
Together, I think we can make it through the next six eras.

**Fujimaru 2:**   
You feeling okay?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, just fine.   
   
**Mash:**   
A Demi-Servant's body has incredible strength,endurance, and self-healing abilities.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'll be back to top health in just a short while.   
   
**Mash:**   
You need to rest though, get some sleep.   
   
**Mash:**   
Maybe you should have the Doctor take a look at you, he is a doctor after all.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Need something?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, I was just thinking of Gilles de Rais.   
   
**Mash:**   
I knew his history, or so I thought. His heart was broken by Jeanne's death...  
   
**Mash:**   
In our history, he became a murderer who killed hundreds of children.   
   
**Mash:**   
...That bloody France was what he wanted. It was an appropriate sight for a murderer.   
   
**Mash:**   
But still, even then&ndash;His real wish was for Jeanne d'Arc to live.   
   
**Mash:**   
That was the source of his rage, and his hatred. A pure rage that could destroy a country&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
Raw feelings are powerful, aren't they? They can destroy the world&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He was human, after all.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Because he was human. Amadeus said something similar, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
...I don't have the experience they do. I don't have those deep feelings, or a heart that can handle them.   
   
**Mash:**   
But I'd like to learn them if I could. Even if I don't understand, I can learn a little at a time.   
   
**Mash:**   
I think that's what Amadeus was talking about.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'll see you tomorrow. Good night.   
   
**Mash:**   
Sweet dreams. May the blessing of the Saint be upon us.
