# Singularity 5: North American Myth War - E Pluribus Unum  
  
## Prelude  
   
**C：???:**  
Hah, hah...Hah...  
   
**A：???:**  
You don't know when to give up, do you, punk? I really want to get this over with.   
   
**C：???:**  
...Damn you!   
   
**C：???:**  
Ugh!   
   
**C：???:**  
The amount of curses covering your body...They're strong enough for you to shoulder an entire nation!   
   
**C：???:**  
Damn you! If you possess this much strength...Why? Why have you fallen to Ravana's level!?   
   
**C：???:**  
Your skill is not something that can be given, but obtained only through sheer will and determination!   
   
**C：???:**  
You could've transcended good and evil! It shouldn't be possible for you to be corrupted like this!   
   
**A：???:**  
Huh? What are you talking about? I'm like this because I've transcended good and evil.   
   
**A：???:**  
I kill my enemies. I will keep killing until one of us dies. That's the only law on the battlefield.   
   
**C：???:**  
Look at this mountain of corpses! Is it your law to slaughter the weak with overwhelming brutality!?   
   
**A：???:**  
Why would I waste my time worrying about something so trivial?   
   
**A：???:**  
What? Don't tell me you actually judge your enemy's worth? You would let them live if they're weak, yet kill them if they're strong?   
   
**A：???:**  
&mdash;That's ridiculous. If you want to kill something in a humane way, do it at a ranch.   
   
**A：???:**  
This is a battlefield. I'm tired of hearing your theories. Just die.   
   
**A：???:**  
It's go time, my demonic thorn of death!   
   
**C：???:**  
Ugh! Brahmastra, full power!   
   
**A：???:**  
Ha! See, you do have it in you. Too bad, you're just a circus clown.   
   
**A：???:**  
Gáe&ndash;Bolg!   
   
**C：???:**  
...Gaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!   
   
**A：???:**  
&ndash;What? How are you still standing?   
   
**A：???:**  
What a pain. You still hang on to life despite having 80% of your heart destroyed. Servants&ndash;Heroes, can be such a nuisance.   
   
**C：???:**  
Gar...Hah...  
   
**C：???:**  
I can't...die here...Not...until I see...Sita!   
   
**A：???:**  
Who the hell is that? Like I care.   
   
**C：???:**  
...Ugh...  
   
**A：???:**  
Huh?   
   
**Mechanized Infantry:**   
Servant response confirmed. Commencing countermeasures.   
   
**A：???:**  
...That trash from the West, huh?   
   
**Soldier:**   
Now, Geronimo!   
   
**C：???:**  
What's...going on?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Just come with me! We have to escape while they keep him busy!   
   
**C：???:**  
Who...Who are you?   
   
**A：???:**  
I see now. You all want to get in my way. In that case, you're all my enemies.   
   
**A：???:**  
In other words, this is a new battlefield! Let me first extend my welcome by killing you!   
   
**Soldier:**   
Geronimo, go! We'll hold him off here!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Thank you!   
   
**A：???:**  
Hah! Ready to sacrifice yourself? Well, look at you! Your morale is pretty high for a mere pawn!   
   
**Soldier:**   
We won't...lose...This land...will not...yield!   
   
**A：???:**  
Oops, I screwed up. He was too annoying so I just crushed him.   
   
**A：???:**  
He pointed his blade toward the king of a nation. I really should just cut off his head and display it as a warning but...I guess there are more where he came from.   
   
**A：???:**  
Hey punk, let's continue. I've already crushed your insides. How about I go for your skull next and&ndash;  
   
**A：???:**  
...What the hell, he's gone already.   
   
**A：???:**  
Tch, that's no fun. Oh well, injuries from my spear's thorn are incurable. He'll eventually die.   
   
**D：???:**  
&ndash;Hehehe, you look braver than ever. Say, which do you like better, to fight, or to kill?   
   
**A：???:**  
Huh? Is there any difference?   
   
**A：???:**  
Or what? Are you one of those idiots who think of eating and living as two separate things?   
   
**D：???:**  
...You're funny, Cú. You really are different. You're like a wild beast.   
   
**D：???:**  
Even in life, there was a part of you that somehow felt like a beast in human's clothing...  
   
**D：???:**  
But this time, I can't sense a single trace of impurity! You're without a doubt a king among all violent beasts!   
   
**D：???:**  
Truly fantastic. I wonder if the hero Cú Chulainn lost all his rationality by being given an imaginary concept.   
   
**D：???:**  
But I like both forms of Cú. Hehe, hehehe, hehehehe!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Well, that's number thirty...Huh? Woman, did you say something?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Either way, job's done. I'm going to sleep now. Wake me up if anything happens.   
   
**D：???:**  
...Oh boy. I'm happy to see you all rough and tough, but it's a shame you're strangely indifferent now.   
   
**D：???:**  
Well, it's fine either way. You probably won't have much chance to show off anymore.   
   
**D：???:**  
Because from here on, it's my turn! Here comes the innocent, perfect, much beloved Queen Medb☆  
   
**Celtic Warrior:**   
...What are your orders?   
   
**Medb:**   
Come, my warriors! It's time to advance our troops! Sing my praises, loudly!   
   
**Medb:**   
Praise me, and kill my enemies! Medb is the best!   
   
**Medb:**   
Oh, my dear and sweet warriors! Come on, we're almost there!   
   
**Medb:**   
This nation! This land! Everything will be ours!   
   
**Medb:**   
Eternal, an eternal nation. We'll create a utopia!   
   
**Medb:**   
If they oppose me, kill them! If they don't oppose me, still kill them!   
   
**Medb:**   
Foolish civilians, unwise leaders, and weak soldiers! I need none of them!   
   
**Medb:**   
The United States will be no more, and from its ashes we'll create a new nation.   
   
**Medb:**   
It'll be an eternal nation only for us! One centered around us!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
How's his condition?   
   
**Soldier:**   
Terrible. It's amazing he could stay alive.   
   
**Soldier:**   
So he's a Servant, too. Like you...Geronimo.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Yes...We need as much manpower as we can get. Tell the shaman to give him the best treatment possible.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
But...things won't get better as they are now.   
   
**Soldier:**   
Geronimo, can we talk for a minute?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
What's going on?   
   
**Soldier:**   
Moments ago, the last fort in the East fell. The United Western States has retreated from the East.   
   
**Soldier:**   
The East-West Civil War will drag on longer than it should. So it means&ndash;  
   
**Geronimo:**   
This place will turn into what the missionary called “Purgatory. ”  
   
**Soldier:**   
What's the difference between Purgatory and Hell?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
No big difference. In either case, it is going to be harsh for us.   
   
**Soldier:**   
What are we going to do?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
You guys should continue infiltrating the Western forces in those costumes.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Although many non-human creatures lurk among the Celts, the Western troops still have a lot of humans.   
   
**Soldier:**   
Yes, understood.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Don't worry. The star is finally starting to show movement. It seems the Mage's Association is getting serious...  
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Wait, no. Perhaps the world is not moving, it's revolving.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
I hope...that this starlight is something that we can be proud of...  
  
**--SECTION BREAK--**  
  
**A：???:**  
&mdash;I woke up at the same time today.   
   
**A：???:**  
I checked my temperature. I checked my five senses. I said my name out loud, so that I could understand it better.   
   
**A：???:**  
I think I've gotten quite used to waking up like this. Previously, my wake-up was a bit more gradual.   
   
**A：???:**  
It was as if I was walking on thin ice,or sneaking in front of an animal in a blissful sleep.   
   
**A：???:**  
That's how I used to wake up. Like I was looking for my way in complete darkness.   
   
**A：???:**  
Of course it's different now. My self-consciousness is stable. I don't have to worry about my memory disappearing after each sleep.   
   
**A：???:**  
I am who I am. Today, too, I can feel that I am myself.   
   
**B：???:**  
Good morning. You're on time as usual. Ready for breakfast?   
   
**B：???:**  
Your brain waves are stable. If you continue like this, you won't need to stay in this sterile chamber anymore.   
   
**B：???:**  
Then you can finally be a researcher at Chaldea. I will throw a celebration for you when that day comes.   
   
**B：???:**  
Do you have any requests? I'll try to get you anything within my capabilities.   
   
**A：???:**  
I couldn't think of what I wanted,but I thought of something I wanted to do.   
   
**A：???:**  
Though I knew this comfortable room was more than enough, I wanted to go outside, just once.   
   
**B：???:**  
Well. You'll get out pretty soon.   
   
**B：???:**  
What I want to give you is more like a gift, not something simple like what you just said...  
   
**A：???:**  
I expressed my intention by shaking my head.   
   
**A：???:**  
What I wanted to see was not outside of my room, but Chaldea. I wanted to see the outside world with my own eyes, not through pictures.   
   
**B：???:**  
Oh, I see...So you want to actually see the sea and the grass field from the VR program I showed you the other day.   
   
**B：???:**  
That'll be difficult. Chaldea is on top of a snowy mountain, 6,000 meters above sea level.   
   
**B：???:**  
Part of it is to prevent top secrets from leaking. Either way, you'll see nothing but a blizzard if you go outside.   
   
**B：???:**  
Maybe you can see the ravine when the weather clears up once a year.   
   
**B：???:**  
Even so, your body can't withstand the outside world. I think it's best for you to change your way of thinking.   
   
**B：???:**  
If you want to see nature then VR is enough. It's not worth it for you to shorten your already short activation period.   
   
**A：???:**  
His smile seemed so troubled, like he was sorry for me. His gaze avoided mine.   
   
**A：???:**  
...It made me feel terribly sorry. I suppose what I said made him feel sad.   
   
**B：???:**  
Oh, but you'll be free anywhere within Chaldea. I will take responsibility and make sure to get the Director's approval.   
   
**B：???:**  
You can rest assured and wait for that day to come. I will think of a gift for you.   
   
**A：???:**  
“Thank you,” I replied.   
   
**A：???:**  
It was hard for me to think about what I wanted, but I was happy that anyone would care that much about me.   
   
**A：???:**  
I am very, very happy.   
   
**A：???:**  
Because today, I can spend another peaceful day without changes.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...That dream just now...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...How was that happiness?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou? Fooou?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait...Am I crying?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...What's this feeling, in my heart?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou? Kyuuu...Fou, fooou!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yup, times like this call for a doctor.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning, Senpai. You're here to see the Doctor for something?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, is that Fujimaru? I'm glad you are here. I need your help convincing her.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash fights in the front lines too much these days. As her physician I think she should take a break...  
   
**Mash:**   
That's not necessary. Senpai should be under the same conditions.   
   
**Mash:**   
As long as Senpai is fighting, I can't find any reason for me to rest.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As you can see, she's insisting that she follow you. Fujimaru, what do you think?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I won't stop her if she wants to come.   
   
**Mash:**   
See? You are being overprotective, Doctor. You are the commander, so please keep your composure.   
   
**Mash:**   
And thank you, Senpai. I will do my best to match your expectations.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash will be fine. I'll protect her.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. I believe in you, Master.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sigh...Oh boy. Though I am happy she's become so dependable in the short while that I wasn't looking...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, it's also true that things can be inconvenient unless Fujimaru is accompanied by Mash...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fine, I will allocate more budget to Mash's health management. But don't force too much on her.   
   
**Mash:**   
No need to worry, Doctor. Self-management is one of the things I'm good at.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'll tell Senpai immediately if I don't feel well. We must stay alert at all times during a Grand Order.   
   
**Mash:**   
Even a slight decrease in my performance would put Master in danger, so I won't hesitate to state my requests.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'll ask for medical attention when injured, and I'll ask for sweets when I need sugar.   
   
**Mash:**   
As far as that goes, I can guarantee you I am on top of that.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmmm, you've really become quite dependable.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, it's a call from the Command Room. They're ready for the next Rayshift.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's get going, Fujimaru, Mash. We'll start with a briefing as usual.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. Let's hurry up, Senpai.   
   
**Fou:**   
...Fooou...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I didn't get a chance to ask the Doctor...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well, it's not like he's going anywhere.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's start the briefing. The rest of Chaldea's staff, please pay attention as well.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
After the battle in London, we now know our enemy is the King of Mages, Solomon.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We're lucky we obtained all sorts of information...Though it was likely on purpose.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Out of all the information we received, here's the important detail&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He will not attack us.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The King of Mages won't fight.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's right. It seems Solomon doesn't care about us taking down the other three Singularities.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He made it clear that he won't attack us until then. Whatever the purpose, it doesn't look like he's lying.   
   
**Mash:**   
So, we can continue with our mission of correcting the Singularities?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes. First, we'll return human history back to its proper course. The problem is&mdash;  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
How to deal with the King of Mages, right? Grand Caster...He stands above all mages.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I don't like the fact that there's a Caster who ranks higher than me, but I suppose it can't be helped.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Inserting the reincarnated Demon Gods into each era...That's not something an ordinary person would think of.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
As a genius myself, I must admit...We currently have no idea how to track him, let alone defeat him.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...You're right. We don't know how to track him.   
   
**Mash:**   
I hear the King of Mages had 72 Demon Gods serving under him. We've defeated at least three of them, that means&ndash;  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
There are 69 left...But there's no point counting them.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
If he's indeed the Grand Caster, he can replenish the lost Demon Gods as much as he wants.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, the familiar known as the “72 Demon Gods” is one single ritual, one single concept.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In that case, all 72 of them must always exist.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As long as they call themselves “Demon Gods,” all 72 pillars will continue to be around Solomon regardless of shape or form.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you mean there is no end?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. Unless we defeat King Solomon, the summoner, the 72 Demon Gods will never disappear from this planet.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are they? Octopus tentacles?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm...I don't think they look that delicious...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...But using marine life as an analogy might be getting to the point...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm...It reminds me of something I've seen in a picture book...But I can't remember...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I know we're in the dark regarding Solomon, but we do know what we have to do.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's think about how to get rid of the Demon Gods after we're done with that.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So, let's start talking about our current coordinates. This is a place that would surprise any mage.   
   
**Mash:**   
Where is it?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
North America. A superpower known as the “United States of America. ”  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You can't exclude this nation from history.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This nation is insignificant when it comes to Magecraft, but historically it's as important as Rome.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Insignificant when it comes to Magecraft...I see, the Doctor is correct.   
   
**Mash:**   
It's true that the United States is still a young nation, and there're no official records of it ever holding a Holy Grail War.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hahaha. To me it's just the place that said I put codes in my paintings.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
When would I have time to do something like that when I'm painting? Even if I did, I'd only do it to spite my client.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That aside, it's not like they're completely void of Magecraft.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Apparently, they've developed their own style of Magecraft that could summon an Elemental down to Earth.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I also confirmed that Heroic Spirits existed.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There are deep-rooted legends of outlaws who would rebel against anything in that nation.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Obviously, we can't treat this like places we've encountered before. I want you to proceed with your search carefully.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&mdash;Then I'll start the Rayshift. Master Fujimaru, please start your preparations.   
   
**Announcement A:**   
Unsummon Program, start. Spiritron Conversion, start.   
   
**Announcement A:**   
Rayshift starting in 3, 2, 1...  
   
**Announcement A:**   
All procedures cleared. Grand Order, commencing operation.   
   
## Section 1: Feet on the Ground, Eyes on the Stars   
   
**Mash:**   
...Whew. The Rayshift was successful, Senpai.   
   
**Mash:**   
We're in a forest somewhere in America in the year 1783.   
   
**Mash:**   
...To be precise, we are on the continent of North America...The United States hasn't been born yet.   
   
**Mash:**   
Once the Revolutionary War against England ends this year, the nation later known as “America” will be established.   
   
**Mash:**   
After that, this nation will turn into a monster-like mega power that dominates this world.   
   
**Mash:**   
Whether that's good or not, there's no doubt that this nation is absolutely essential for the proper course of history.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is England the enemy?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who is the enemy?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's say America loses the war, and the nation known as the United States never comes into existence.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Right, though that certainly is a possibility, the mere result of the Revolutionary War won't change the flow of history.   
   
**Mash:**   
As long as America has shown its will for independence, even if that process gets delayed for 30 to 50 years...  
   
**Mash:**   
Eventually the United States of America will be established.   
   
**Mash:**   
I don't think it's as simple as “England is our enemy. ”  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry, I know you've just arrived but we have a bit of an issue! I've detected a large scale battle just ahead!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I don't know the details, but please hurry! This is not an ordinary battle!   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. Master, let's go!   
   
**Mash:**   
This is...  
   
**Soldier:**   
Stand your ground, elites of the glorious Mechanized Infantry Brigade! Protect this territory with your lives!   
   
**Mechanized Soldier:**   
Yes! Domination Order! We're ready to keep firing till our barrels are empty!   
   
**Mash:**   
Th-That's...Mr. Babbage!? Senpai, it's Mr. Babbage!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Calm down, Mash. That's not him.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Calm down, Mash. It's nothing.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**???:**  
&mdash;!   
   
**Mash:**   
The other side is...a lot more retro-looking!   
   
**Mechanized Soldier:**   
&mdash;Oh, terrible. Enemy reinforcements spotted. Firing warning shots, then proceeding to exterminate!   
   
**Mash:**   
The guns are pointed at us&mdash;Senpai!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
For now, let's fight back!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood, Master! This is our first battle on North American soil, I'll do my best!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Soldier:**   
I-Impossible! The enhanced exoskeleton “Hard Work Mk-2” given by His Excellency was destroyed!?   
   
**Soldier:**   
And by such a frail-looking girl? Could she be...the Servant-Type enemy I read about in my report?   
   
**Soldier:**   
Fine! Retreat! We'll move our front line back until the reinforcements arrive! Hurry!   
   
**Mash:**   
Hah...Hah...We did it, Master!   
   
**Mash:**   
I can't grasp the situation yet, but it seems one side has retreated&mdash;  
   
**???:**  
&mdash;!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Be careful! Now the other side has targeted you! Please hang on for a little bit longer, Fujimaru!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**C：???:**  
&mdash;!   
   
**Mash:**   
We did it! Now those people are retreating as well!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good job, Mash!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash, you should get back, too!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes! We should hurry and retreat as well! If we continue to stay here, we'll get flanked by both forc&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, fall back now&mdash;No...RUN!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai? Senpai!   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor! Senpai is airborne!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? Mash, what did you just say?   
   
**Mash:**   
You know, airborne! Like when your two feet are above the ground and...Oh never mind!   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai! Stay with me, please! Senpai, Senpai!   
   
## Section 2: The Lady with a Lamp   
   
**???:**  
......  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**???:**  
Patient No. 99, severely wounded. The wound on the right arm is serious, I recommend amputation.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**???:**  
Here, too...I don't think it can be saved. Left femur shattered. It's a miracle that this one's alive.   
   
**???:**  
We're going to have to amputate this as well.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
???  
   
  
---  
  
   
**???:**  
Gouge wound on the lateral region of the abdomen...No problem, as long as we remove the damaged organs and stitch it back up.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
???  
   
  
---  
  
   
**???:**  
Don't worry, you'll still live. Your condition is far better than the other patients here.   
   
**???:**  
In another 200 years, highly advanced artificial limbs should be developed...I suppose that's too far ahead.   
   
**???:**  
Now then, it's time to amputate.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Whoa, whoa, whoa!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**???:**  
This should've been a surgeon's job, but seeing how we don't have enough physicians here, I will do it.   
   
**???:**  
Please bite on this. It's going to hurt.   
   
**???:**  
If I were to compare it to something...It'll hurt as much as getting your arm ripped off.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's the same thing!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You don't have much of a vocabulary, do you!?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**???:**  
You mustn't be so childish. At least it's better than dying, isn't it?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um, I don't really think amputation is necessary.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Just stitch me back up, please!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**???:**  
No. I'm doing it. I'm cutting. This wound, at least, must be dealt with swiftly.   
   
**???:**  
Don't worry, you're still young. I know you can endure something like this.   
   
**???:**  
...Sorry. That sounded rather vague. Let me correct myself. You must endure it no matter what.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're crazy!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You just want to cut something, don't you?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**???:**  
...You there, don't come in here in that unsanitary state when I'm treating someone!   
   
**Mash:**   
Please wait! Stop! You've got the wrong person!   
   
**???:**  
There's no mistake. All patients are equal, be they a private or a colonel.   
   
**???:**  
No matter who they are, I'll do the best I can to save them. In order to do that, proper hygiene is essential.   
   
**???:**  
Listen to me. Take one step closer and I'll shoot you.   
   
**Mash:**   
I-I wasn't about to!   
   
**???:**  
Your eyes told me otherwise.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I am fine!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't like where this is going!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai! Thank goodness, you're conscious!   
   
**???:**  
How are you fine? It's a miracle that your limbs are still attached after taking a direct hit from the cannons.   
   
**???:**  
Normally, I would amputate those limbs to prevent the blood from reaching unnecessary areas...  
   
**???:**  
And by keeping those wounds clean, we can prevent them from getting infected.   
   
**???:**  
Don't worry, I am going to heal you, even if that means killing you.   
   
**???:**  
Yes...I will do everything in my power to save you! I will take your life if I have to!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's messed up!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The ends and means are reversed?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**???:**  
I am sure some people see it that way. But sometimes, you have no room for doubt in the field of medicine.   
   
**Mash:**   
Medicine...Cleanliness...Ah. Um, are you...  
   
**???:**  
Am I what?   
   
**Mash:**   
You're a Servant...Aren't you?   
   
**???:**  
That has nothing to do with this. As long as I'm summoned here, I'll only think about how to follow my conviction.   
   
**???:**  
My conviction is my strength, and that is medical treatment. It doesn't matter if I'm a Servant or not, I must do my best here.   
   
**???:**  
Now that I'm summoned to this battlefield, I must treat these patients.   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? Ah, um, but you're a Servant, right? That person there is a Master.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sure you know that means that I must protect my Master. That's non-negotiable, even with you.   
   
**???:**  
That goes the same with me. My conviction won't falter unless you can have a stronger...  
   
**???:**  
...Wait. You...That body of yours...  
   
**???:**  
...Fine, understood. I'll withhold my treatment for now.   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, here's a Scroll of Healing.   
   
**Mash:**   
...You're all right. You're back to normal now.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I thought I was a goner...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Whew. Thank goodness it turned out okay...  
   
**???:**  
All right, if you're finished, get out of the way! My next patient is coming!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is this place?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I...don't really know myself...But this is the rear base of the American Independence Army.   
   
**Mash:**   
Do you remember that last battle?   
   
**Mash:**   
The American army lost. Their forces retreated from the front line.   
   
**Mash:**   
I followed along. Um...since they carried you here, Master.   
   
**Mash:**   
I don't know who's on the other side.... But I'm at least certain that it's not the British army.   
   
**Mash:**   
And there's one more thing. This army is strange, too. The American flag they're flying isn't what it's supposed to be...  
   
**Mash:**   
...and the ones they sent in to fight...were the same things we encountered in London.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Things...Homunculi?   
   
**Mash:**   
No, unfortunately, that's not what they are. I'll give you some hints: the smell of oil, looks like iron...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They're the robot army?   
   
**Mash:**   
That's it. Charles Babbage, the King of Steam. These things were the same as his production model.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hi, Fujimaru. Um...So that was a disaster, huh?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In any case, what you've encountered was probably due to the Singularity.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I don't know what they are, and there are many mysteries about this army you've joined up with...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But what I can be certain of is that someone is trying to prevent the United States of America from being established.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If the United States isn't established, it will cause a logical error in this world.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Aside from the “anchor” that King Solomon used, I believe other powerful Servants are appearing in this era.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But we're not going to change our methods.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We'll keep looking for help from Servants who are already summoned.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...And, I fully understand how you'd be nervous about this, but I think we should ask the Servant that's in front of us now.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
She seems dependable...I think?   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, when you say it like that, it almost sounds like this isn't your problem...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, I'm just a little scared. Just a little. I'm not good with nurses who are too serious...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But you two aren't me. That's a battlefield, not an infirmary!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Besides, we can't afford to be picky! Just try talking to her, Fujimaru!   
   
**Mash:**   
Actually...I proposed that earlier...but it didn't work. She won't listen.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Why not?   
   
**Mash:**   
Seeing how she talks and acts, I have no doubt that her class is Berserker, and&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
I can't be certain yet, but her True Name is probably...Florence Nightingale.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Did we get a new patient?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Don't call my name unless you need me. All right, the treatment is done.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Keep the wounds clean, you hear me?   
   
**Soldier:**   
Thank you...very much...Are you...an angel?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I don't know.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Angels don't give out beautiful flowers,they're the ones who fight for those in distress.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
If you're in agony, yet still choose to fight&ndash;Then I will be there for you.   
   
**Mash:**   
I knew it, you're Florence Nightingale, aren't you?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;I fail to see how that makes any difference.   
   
**Mash:**   
Please help us. Unless we correct the Singularity&ndash;  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Please don't bring up such foolishness. I have patients here waiting for me.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That is the only reason and motivation for my being summoned.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There's a way to save them all.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There's a way to treat them all.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...What's that now?   
   
**Mash:**   
You heard that right. May I, Ms. Nightingale?   
   
**Mash:**   
No matter how hard you struggle,the number of patients will keep increasing.   
   
**Mash:**   
In a normal war, the number of casualties slow down somewhere along the line.   
   
**Mash:**   
However, this is no normal war. This enemy will fight until the last man is dead.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You say the patient count will keep increasing?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, unfortunately. That's exactly why we need to cut it off at the root.   
   
**Soldier:**   
Enemy raid, enemy raid!   
   
**Mash:**   
You there, sir! Is the enemy the same as before?   
   
**Soldier:**   
That's right! Anyone who can walk, prepare to engage! The mechanized brigade won't get here in time! So get the cannons ready!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, let's fight with them.   
   
**Mash:**   
If we can't maintain the front line here,the patients will...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I know!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We can't let them attack this camp!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;Wait. I'll go with you.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Despite my appearance, I know a thing or two about combat. But most of all, I can't let these patients be injured anymore.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Doctor Rush! Please treat these patients just the way I told you.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
The patients who mustn't be moved are housed in the big tent. I want to move them, but that would risk their lives more.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Those who can walk on their own, please help those who can't. When you do, be very careful not to touch their wounds.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I won't let the enemy reach this tent. This is our sanctuary.   
   
**Doctor:**   
R-Right. But...Who are you?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I'm a nurse. Nothing more, nothing less. Follow me, Servant!   
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right!   
   
**Doctor:**   
...Th-That's a nurse?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Okay, time for treatment. I'll remove the infected parts right away.   
   
**Mash:**   
C-Calm down, okay? ...After another look, it seems our enemy can move better than humans.   
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway, let's fight. This is the front line. We can't win if we don't hold them here.   
   
**Mash:**   
Here I go, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
More are on the way. They're more powerful than the ones before...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We've become more powerful as well.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right! Let's keep going!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
It's a stalemate. For them, it may have been their first Servant battle ever.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I don't think they'll reach the tent, but&ndash;Mm. Mm, mm. Mm.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&ndash;Detecting enemy Servants. Two of them!   
   
**D：???:**  
Your Majesty. We've found them.   
   
**D：???:**  
Apparently they're Servants. I can see why our troops aren't pushing onward.   
   
**D：???:**  
This is probably as far as the unsung warriors can go. Now it's our turn to step up.   
   
**C：???:**  
Just what I'd expect from my subordinate, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne. Your eyes are, yes, if I were to compare, akin to a hawk's!   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
...You are too kind. Compared to your wisdom, Fionn mac Cumhaill, I am nothing.   
   
**Fionn:**   
Hahaha! Enough with the modesty. You have an eye for beauty. The fact that you chose Gráinne proves it.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
...N-No. I wouldn't...say that...Uh...  
   
**Fionn:**   
Sorry, I was only joking! That was a bit mean of me! Now, let's fight!   
   
**Fionn:**   
Let's show them the power of the Knights of Fianna! And...let's bring an eternal empire to this fertile land!   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
As you wish! Now, ladies. Prepare yourselves.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
I am Diarmuid Ua Duibhne,the best spearman in the Knights of Fianna.   
   
**Mash:**   
Diarmuid...the “radiant-faced” Diarmuid Ua Duibhne.   
   
**Mash:**   
And standing right behind him is his lord,Fionn mac Cumhaill...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
In other words, you two are pathogens.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Pathogens? No, we're just warriors. Nothing more, nothing less.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Whoa!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&mdash;With your death, I shall eradicate this disease!   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Ugh...So you don't listen to what people say, huh? I don't like it, I really don't like such women...  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Ugh!   
   
**Fionn:**   
You were caught off guard, Diarmuid! Leave it to me, I'll heal your wounds!   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
My lord, I am grateful. Please accept my apologies. Forgive me, I was overwhelmed.   
   
**Fionn:**   
Hahaha, that's my “Ladykiller” Diarmuid. So you're not comfortable taking on women?   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
No...I wouldn't say...Uh...  
   
**Fionn:**   
Hahaha! I jest, I jest! That was a pretty good one, too!   
   
**Fionn:**   
But no need to worry. They're both good-looking, powerful women.   
   
**Fionn:**   
I don't blame you for holding back. Now then, I shall head out myself.   
   
**Fionn:**   
In the name of the glorious Knights of Fianna,I shall claim their heads!   
   
**Fionn:**   
Lancer, Fionn mac Cumhaill...here I come!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Fionn:**   
Hmm. To think they're more than a match for both of us. Quite impressive...Are they seasoned veterans?   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, we couldn't finish them off!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Wait! What's this...The wounded back at the camp...  
   
**Mash:**   
Wait, what? Nightingale, where are you going?   
   
**Fionn:**   
Oh, my, I think she's noticed.   
   
**Fionn:**   
Oh unknown Shielder Servant. This Holy Grail War is by all means...a war.   
   
**Fionn:**   
As far as we're concerned, we only needed to keep you here.   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh no! The other soldiers!   
   
**Fionn:**   
They're nameless warriors. Just unique monsters who will continue to fight.   
   
**Fionn:**   
Of course, they're no match for Servants...But I wonder...How about the American troops?   
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh!   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
...! Your Majesty, please retreat!   
   
**Fionn:**   
&ndash;What?   
   
**???:**  
Right flank, left flank, surround the enemy! We're going to charge down the middle!   
   
**???:**  
They're beasts who only process what's right before them! But we have wisdom!   
   
**Fionn:**   
Is that...the much-rumored Resistance? If there are more Servants, there's nothing we can do.   
   
**Fionn:**   
Fine. We'll retreat for now, Diarmuid! Give the order to the other warriors as well!   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Very well. But will they be able to comprehend our orders?   
   
**Fionn:**   
Hmm? If they don't, it can't be helped. We'll abandon them. Come on, don't feel bad.   
   
**Fionn:**   
They're monsters born indefinitely from our queen. Even if we lose a few thousand here, it won't be a problem for us!   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
...Indeed, my liege. All right...Let us retreat.   
   
**Fionn:**   
Oh, before we do, I forgot something important. Oh beautiful Demi-Servant.   
   
**Mash:**   
D-Do you mean me?   
   
**Fionn:**   
Yes, I mean you. Are you determined to oppose us?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Along with my Master, we will defeat you.   
   
**Fionn:**   
That's a beautiful gaze, full of sincerity. I shall forgive your transgression for showing me such a wonderful gaze.   
   
**Fionn:**   
In return...If you're defeated, I shall have your heart! That's right, you shall become my wife!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Excuse me?   
   
**Fionn:**   
I can't wait, I really can't wait! A truly blissful promise! Now, then, farewell! Fare thee well!   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
...(There he goes again, just like that...)  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Pardon us. It's a bad habit of my king's. You might think it's a prank, but he actually never lies.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
He must've fallen for the sight of you fighting so bravely. If you're defeated, please consider surrender and submission.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Now, then, farewell! Fare thee well!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Um. What was that last part about?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He proposed to you.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He asked for your hand in marriage.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-Is that right? Well, that was a bit of a...surprise.   
   
**Mash:**   
Um...I have no comment on the man himself,but his words did have an impact...or should I say...  
   
**Mash:**   
I felt like my heart skipped a beat...Sorry, let me take a deep breath.   
   
**Mash:**   
Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hey! Are you okay? Looks like the enemy Servants are gone for now...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...but now a different Servant has appeared. It's heading your way.   
   
**Mash:**   
Let's join Nightingale right away!   
   
## Section 3: Fragment of the Star   
   
**C：???:**  
Green, I'm out of ammo. Cover me.   
   
**D：???:**  
Gotcha.   
   
**D：???:**  
By the way, why do you call me “Green”? Who's this “Green”?   
   
**C：???:**  
I mean, you and I are both Archers, right? So we either call each other by our True Names or use code names.   
   
**C：???:**  
But neither of us wants to use our True Names, right? You know, as outlaws.   
   
**D：???:**  
I'm no outlaw. That's just how it turned out. Basically, I'm just a lazy-ass.   
   
**C：???:**  
Say, if you were an animal you would be a gorilla, right? I mean, Druids are like sages of the forest? Then you would be a gori&ndash;  
   
**D：???:**  
Green is fine, just call me Green. And why are you “Thunder”?   
   
**C：???:**  
Huh? It sounds cool, no? Thunder. Plus it's the name of my gun.   
   
**D：???:**  
...To be honest, between this land, what you wear, and that gun, I have a pretty good idea of your True Name. Is that okay?   
   
**C：???:**  
Come on, I can say the same for you. Faceless ruler of the forest, specialist in guerilla warfare.   
   
**D：???:**  
It's not good to go without a face. Now that we're done with idle chatter&mdash;  
   
**C：???:**  
Right, now that we're done&mdash;What do we do with this?   
   
**D：???:**  
How's that escape hatch we made?   
   
**C：???:**  
It's good. We can use it. It'd just be a shame to, that's all.   
   
**C：???:**  
After we gathered up all these weapons and ammo......Hmm, maybe we overdid it?   
   
**D：???:**  
Well, after all that sabotage, I'd say a bit.   
   
**D：???:**  
Doesn't seem like they have any Servants over there,but we're done for if they engage in close combat.   
   
**D：???:**  
...Well, it's all in fate's hands now. Want me to pray for the Master to come to our aid?   
   
**C：???:**  
Are you mad? Were your prayers ever answered in life?   
   
**D：???:**  
Why, sure. But you have to be a good boy.   
   
**D：???:**  
Unfortunately, it hasn't worked since I became an adult. I guess we're both just bad boys?   
   
**C：???:**  
Hmph, speak for yourself! I always said my prayers, just like my mom taught me.   
   
**D：???:**  
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure if you pray from the bottom of your heart, we'll be saved.   
   
**C：???:**  
Mmm, I guess praying in your spare time doesn't work. Well, I&ndash;  
   
**C：???:**  
was expecting that, too.   
   
**D：???:**  
Praying while blasting away with your gun won't do a thing. I mean, God can't hear your prayers over the gunshots.   
   
**D：???:**  
Whoa, someone fell for it. I'll go light 'em up.   
   
**C：???:**  
Yeah, knock yourself out.   
   
**C：???:**  
...Still, I'm tired. I wonder how long the Resistance is gonna hold out.   
   
**C：???:**  
Sooner or later, they'll reach their limit. I just hope Geronimo finds the “star” by then&ndash;  
   
**C：???:**  
Whoa, that was close. The “Regulators” are closed for today. Please visit us another day. See ya!   
   
**Mash:**   
Nightingale?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Please give me a moment.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I'm in the middle of telling Dr. Rush how to care for the patients.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Honestly, though this is long before I was born, there is too little risk management concerning sanitation.   
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Listen to me. The wounds must be kept clean, and don't lay beds edge-to-edge.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Normally, I would never let patients lie down on the filthy ground.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Giving them vomit-inducing medication or bloodletting to expel toxins, or having them drink mercury chloride...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
If you perform outdated treatments like that again, I will punch you until you need treatment yourself. You've been warned.   
   
**Doctor:**   
But those are the latest techniques...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Which is the latest, this gun or that treatment? Don't make me repeat myself.   
   
**Doctor:**   
U-Understood! Understood! I understand! Please, no more guns, latest or not!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Also, treat all patients equally, regardless of age, gender, race, or social status.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
The only discrimination is the order they receive treatment.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
If you don't follow those rules, this bullet will go through your forehead, even if I'm 5,000 kilometers away.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...You got all that, Benjamin Rush? Please take good care of the patients.   
   
**Doctor:**   
I-I will. You can be assured of that!   
   
**Doctor:**   
She's gone.   
   
**Doctor:**   
...Still, she's an outstanding nurse for being so radical.   
   
**Doctor:**   
“Regardless of race” are brave words in this day and age.   
   
**Doctor:**   
Seems she came from Europe. She must be famous over there.   
   
**Doctor:**   
...I have issues with that gun, though...  
   
**Mash:**   
Um...Did you just fire that?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
It's your imagination. Let's go.   
   
**Mash:**   
No, it isn't my imagination. You just fired that without hesitation.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I just used the back of its blade.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do guns have blades?   
   
**Mash:**   
If I have to guess...I think she means the bottom of the grip. You just lightly tap the back of the head like this?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I know. You can do that with shields, too.   
   
**Mash:**   
Of course. The trick is to strike gently, and at the moment of impact, shift the strike point...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Excuse me, please refrain from idle chatter during treatment. Come, let's go.   
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, right! My apologies!   
   
**Mash:**   
Um...Senpai. Is it normal to feel a little bit worried?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fouuu.   
   
**C：???:**  
Wait, Florence. Where do you think you're going?   
   
**C：???:**  
Do you know that leaving your post in the military is an offense that can get you shot?   
   
**C：???:**  
Get back to your post now. Or else harsh punishment will be waiting for you.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...You go back to your post.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
My job has not changed at all.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I feel like I almost found a way to treat the soldiers' ailments at their core, so that's what I'm going to do.   
   
**C：???:**  
Oh, really? That is reasonable. Thank you. But&mdash;  
   
**C：???:**  
I can't let a Berserker like you wander off like that. What happens if you end up disrupting our troops?   
   
**C：???:**  
The king would never approve of this.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...The king? Someone like that has absolutely no right to stop me.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Unless you have a better way to treat the soldiers. I'm all ears.   
   
**C：???:**  
Sheesh, you really can't talk to a Berserker. I wonder what I should do.   
   
**C：???:**  
We've never seen eye to eye, so maybe this is a good chance to get rid of you?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Well, that's not very kind of you, but I feel the same way. That saves me some trouble.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yikes...We've got sparks flying over here...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Why is it when two strong-minded women clash, it always turns into a bloodbath like this?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Doctor, calm down.   
   
**Mash:**   
I think this is happening because they're both correct, and stubborn in their own way!   
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway, we can't let them kill each other! Senpai, may I intervene?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash, please intervene!   
   
**Mash:**   
Roger that. I'm not confident, but I'll do my best!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
P-Pardon me for interrupting! Are you...a Servant too?   
   
**C：???:**  
Too? You mean...Oh! So many Servants! Great!   
   
**C：???:**  
When I heard the Celts were driven away,I assumed Florence had lost her mind again...  
   
**C：???:**  
But it seems I was wrong. So this is good news for the king?   
   
**Mash:**   
King?   
   
**C：???:**  
Oh, you don't know America's current situation? This country has split into two, and now the two sides are at war with each other.   
   
**C：???:**  
The other side is good-for-nothing savages who just want to destroy.   
   
**C：???:**  
And there's our side&ndash;the United Western States, led by our king.   
   
**C：???:**  
It's a civil war between the East and the West...not the North and the South.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So it's not even “What if the South won the Civil War? ”but a clash between two unknown armies.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, pardon me, miss. What's your name?   
   
**C：???:**  
Oh. You recognized Florence at a glance,but you don't know me?   
   
**Mash:**   
I-I'm sorry...Ms. Nightingale was...Um, anyway, it was easy to guess...  
   
**C：???:**  
That's okay, I'm only giving you a hard time. Please forgive my childishness.   
   
**C：???:**  
I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself earlier. I am Helena Petrovna Blavatsky.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Well, I suppose I'm known more as Madame Blavatsky. I didn't appreciate having to change my maiden name.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Helena Blavatsky! The poster girl for 19th-century occultism!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A talented woman independent from the Mage's Association who codified occultism with only her distinctive powers&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But seeing as how you're a Servant here,are you acting as an agent for the Mage's Association?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
No. In this world, all major nations other than America are completely destroyed.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who is this king?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So who do you serve?   
  
---  
  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Oh, so you're the Master. What a pity. We have already decided who to serve.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
That's the king. If he conquers the globe, I have no problem with it.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
I believe we'd become Lemuria, breaking away from other dimensions and continuing to wander.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Kind of like the Throne of Heroes. Don't you think that is a happy ending in its own way?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;I can't accept that as treatment. Amputating the bad part and then walking away is outrageous.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...Well, I figured you would say that. But what do you think?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A definite no!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Oh, I see.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No, ma'am!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...I must admit to being a little irritated. “Ma'am. ” What is this “ma'am”?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...Ahem. Well then, where are you people taking Florence?   
   
**Mash:**   
...In order to prevent the destruction of this world, we intend to remove the cause.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
I see. Then I suppose that makes us enemies.   
   
**Mash:**   
No, it doesn't have to be like that. Would you please let us go?   
   
**Mash:**   
We're just leaving here with Nightingale as our ally.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Hmph. Then you are able to understand Florence's will.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
That makes me somewhat relieved,but I still can't let you go.   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Not even Mash could convince her...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So the punchline to this venture is that there aren't any Servants joining our side?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There is one!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
One right here!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
I'm done talking. Let's go, Fujimaru.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I don't want to waste a minute or even a second. I'm going to cure this war.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
R-Right. Anyway, she's on our side and we're just barely managing to communicate with her!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru! Escape from there with Nightingale!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Ahhh, you leave me no choice. Now I have to call out my elites.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
We'll start with them. Mechanized infantry, come forward!   
   
**Mash:**   
The production model Babbages from earlier!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Oh, have you encountered Mr. Babbage? Have you been to 19th-century England?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...Oh, I see. He was defeated, wasn't he? Poor man.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
But these won't lose. After all, the king personally “worked” on them!   
   
**Mash:**   
“Worked” on them?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Babbage used the powers of the Grail and Noble Phantasm to produce his clones. However, the power of science was used here to mass-produce these.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Even if the result is the same, the approach differs. And if the approach differs, the result will too.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Well, quoting our king...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
“Of course electricity is better than steam, you fool! ”  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-They're electric?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm fired up!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's so cool!   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, seeing your eyes glitter like that worries me a little...b-but anyway, here I go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
We defeated them! Be they steam-powered or electric, once they're broken the victory is ours!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
An obvious truth. But it all ends here.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Okay, Karna! Hurry up and finish them off!   
   
**Mash:**   
What...Umm, I'm sorry. What did you just say?   
   
**Karna:**   
...It's my turn? Understood.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Whoa! All of a sudden I'm picking up a Servant response! It's right above you!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Forced teleportation...Command Spell!? ...What's going on!?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The readings I'm getting from his Spirit Origin are off the charts!   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh no...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Sorry, but could you go ahead and capture them? I mean, it looks like they're enemies for the time being.   
   
**Karna:**   
I'll oblige to your frivolous conjecture.   
   
**Karna:**   
Travelers from afar, pardon the rough welcome. &ndash;Brahmastra!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Retreat...Oh no, he's too fast!   
   
## Section 4: King of Presidents   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, Senpai! I'm so glad, you woke up!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What on earth happened?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
My head hurts...  
  
---  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Your Servant blocked that Noble Phantasm attack. However, its shockwave knocked everyone unconscious.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
While our lives were spared,it appears that we are in their custody now.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Oh, so you're awake. Right now we're in the midst of transporting you.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
You can run away if you like...But, the bad news is that these babies will target the Master, aggressively.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Though Karna probably won't do a thing, since he's firm on his policy of not killing a Master.   
   
**Karna:**   
...That's a misunderstanding. I will kill a Master first depending on the situation.   
   
**Karna:**   
Of course, first you must show me that you have the reason, conviction, and determination to convince me to kill a Master.   
   
**Karna:**   
For instance, is the one issuing the order willing to exchange their own life for it?   
   
**Karna:**   
If that's the case, I am willing to consider.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
See, he says stuff that's basically unthinkable on a battlefield.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Well, that's how Karna is,but that doesn't change your situation in the slightest.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
At such close range, it would be quite difficult to slip past the mechanized infantry, don't you think?   
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Now, now, be good.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where are we headed?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What do you want?   
  
---  
  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
First, I'll have you meet my king. You should decide which side to be on after that.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Well, I know the two Servants sitting right there won't side with us that easily. That much I'm sure of.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
However, I'm sure things will be different if we can persuade the Master.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Umm, Lady Blavatsky.   
   
**Mash:**   
Why is it that you go to such lengths to take the side of this “king”?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Lady! I like the sound of that. You're a nice girl. You understand etiquette!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Your name is Mash, right? In light of your proper manners, I shall answer you.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
The biggest reason why I support the king is that we were closely connected when we were alive.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Oh, it's not like we had an affair or anything like that. We kept in close contact, and I owe him a lot...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
The Celts who dominate the East won't accept anyone other than themselves.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Even if I surrendered to the Celts, they would just kill me. Or maybe they would sacrifice me for the sake of their war.   
   
**Mash:**   
...The Celts...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Those Servants you saw earlier were Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, right?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If that's the case, we'll be seeing a lot of Celtic Servants this time.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As far as I know from the legends, they all have a few screws loose. They're a bunch of airheaded Berserkers!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
What were those magical energy waves just now? Is there someone else with you?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Hey, are you keeping a fairy in your pocket or something? Nothing? Then, just where did that voice come from...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Oh. Is Graham Bell with you or something?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
If he were, the king would seriously lose his temper this time.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hate to break it to you, but when it comes to long-distance communications, we're a few steps ahead.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Apologies for introducing myself so late, Ms. Blavatsky. I'm their navigator.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
My name is Dr. Roman. Make sure you don't forget it, as we may cross paths someday.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Wow...I can tell you're an imprudent man just by your voice. You're clearly up to no good, my dear.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hey! Why does everyone always dis me when they first meet me?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Well, it doesn't matter. It means Fujimaru has an advisor as well.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
So, let's get back to the subject. You all get it now, right?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
You can't win in this war unless you side with somebody. It will only get you killed if you try to take on both sides.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
This world maintains a precarious balance as the East and West continue to fight.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
If we didn't fight, this nation would have been completely destroyed and beyond salvation by now, you see?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So both sides just like to fight?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Dear, you're not a good listener, are you? Has anyone called you stubborn before?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Well, at any rate, you should meet the king at least once...It'll be amusing.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So what are we, really?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Oh. I see. So I hadn't gotten around to explaining that yet. But...Heh heh.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
We've already come this far, I don't want to ruin the surprise. Besides, isn't that more amusing?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Amusing...you say?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Well, someone is calling himself “king” in this ultimate democratic nation. How is that not amusing?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Oh, if self-proclaimed title counts, I do remember there's an emperor as well.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
You sure know a lot about snobs. If he were a Heroic Spirit, I'm sure he would lament the current situation.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Ah, but first we have a preliminary show. Perfect. Can you help me out?   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Pretty please♪  
   
**Mash:**   
Master?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's fight for now.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's defend for now.   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. Either way, they're enemies we must eventually stand against.   
   
**Mash:**   
Okay, here I go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Here we are.   
   
**Mash:**   
...A fortress unfitting for America.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
The White House was taken over,so we had no choice.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
We built the fortress from the ground up. We should use anti-Celt measures to resist the Celts, right?   
   
**Mechanized Infantry:**   
Madam Blavatsky, Lord Karna. The presi-king awaits. Please come right away.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
M-Maybe I heard wrong. Did he just say “presi-king” or something?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, no doubt...I don't know how to say this, but it's so...simplistic.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Right? But that's what makes it charming. It's not an idea we'd come up with.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Come, follow me. The king, despite his appearance, has a short temper.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...So your employer is just ahead, right?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nightingale, wait!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you itching that badly for a battle!?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Karna:**   
Wait. That would be a bad move, Nightingale. Let your gun rest a while longer.   
   
**Karna:**   
If you want to cure this world's soldiers, identify the pathogen first. Or are you that simplistic as well?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...In the meantime, more soldiers die. Are you telling me to bear with that?   
   
**Karna:**   
Yes. Bear with it, but do not get accustomed to it. It may be tough for you, but consider it a trial.   
   
**Karna:**   
Or is long-term treatment not your policy? If so&mdash;  
   
**Karna:**   
I wonder which is beyond saving? You, or this land?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
What? Are you saying my treatment is wrong?   
   
**Karna:**   
Not quite. But everyone makes mistakes. Humans fall to ruin when convinced that their ideas are the only absolutes.   
   
**Karna:**   
...Anyway, if you idly meet your death here, that would be truly meaningless.   
   
**Karna:**   
Everything has a proper order. Even if you temporarily defeat an enemy here, it may cause a greater evil to prosper.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;I see. I understand your valuable opinion. I will put the gun away for now.   
   
**Karna:**   
...Good grief. What a consummate liar. Blavatsky, I will keep an eye on her.   
   
**Karna:**   
You look after this world's only Master and that Servant.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Yes yes, I know! Well then, let's get ourselves an audience with the king!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
I've brought them to see you, Mr. Presi-king.   
   
**Mechanized Infantry:**   
Understood. It will be another minute until the presi-king's arrival.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm starting to get nervous, Senpai. I wonder what kind of king he is...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I have a bad feeling about this.   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You might be right on that.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm detecting a new Servant approaching you,but there's something bizarre about it...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Umm...I wonder if this really is a Heroic Spirit?   
   
**Mash:**   
Bizarre? In what way, Doctor?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I don't want to affect your first impression with my speculation. Anyway, we'll talk after you meet this King.   
   
**Mechanized Infantry:**   
Thank you for waiting. The presi-king is here!   
   
**E：???:**  
Oh! At last I get the chance to meet that angel!   
   
**E：???:**  
How I have yearned for this moment!   
   
**E：???:**  
I intended on inviting them only after they eliminated the Celts, but this is fine, too!   
   
**E：???:**  
Yes, advancing the schedule is a good thing! Much better than pushing back the deadline!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...I see he still hasn't fixed his habit of talking to himself while walking. I was hoping he could at least have kept that to himself.   
   
**Mash:**   
That was “talking to himself? ”  
   
**Mash:**   
D-Did you hear how loud he was, Senpai!? No human could do that!   
   
**E：???:**  
&mdash;To be frank, you have all done a fantastic job! Greetings, everyone! And congratulations!   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? Is the monitor broken? All I see on it is a creature?   
   
**E：???:**  
I'll say it once more! All of you have done a fantastic job!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
I bet you were pretty surprised. Right? Right? Right?   
   
**Karna:**   
...Well, yes, they'd be surprised.   
   
**Mash:**   
W-Well, I was indeed surprised...but it's fine, I'm getting used to things of this sort...  
   
**Mash:**   
That aside, umm...You must be the king who controls Western America, right?   
   
**E：???:**  
Indeed, it is as you say.   
   
**E：???:**  
I have taken it upon myself to rule America in order to pulverize those barbaric Celts&mdash;  
   
**E：???:**  
I am a Servant, and a gentleman who supports other Servants! I am Thomas Alva Edison, the presi-king!   
   
**Mash:**   
E!?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
DI!?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
SON of a gun!?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
&mdash;Oh, excuse me. I was at a complete loss for words.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Edison...Edison, the King of Inventions? It's really you? You're not a Chimera?   
   
**Edison:**   
Indeed. Although I am currently the presi-king, not the King of Inventions.   
   
**Edison:**   
You must be Lady Florence Nightingale.... You are just as beautiful as they say...  
   
**Edison:**   
Unfortunately we could not meet when we were alive, but this moment is truly a miracle of energy, no, a miracle of souls.   
   
**Edison:**   
I was not one to live on the battlefield, but I deeply respect your convictions and rationality.   
   
**Edison:**   
Do lend us your strength. Not only to advance medicine, but also to boost the morale of our soldiers&mdash;  
   
**Edison:**   
The effects of you as poster girl are immeasurable! Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...I had no idea you were not human.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
To put it lightly...He's a feline?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
To put it figuratively...From the Savanna?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Edison:**   
What? I am without a doubt a human!   
   
**Edison:**   
Humans are just higher forms of beasts who possess reason and wisdom. They shall not be segregated by the color of their skin or the shape of their face.   
   
**Edison:**   
Even if I possess a lion's head,that fact does not change.   
   
**Edison:**   
I am Edison, an intelligent human being. That is all.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Wow, just look how he asserts himself with confidence. I really need to learn that kind of positivity.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Basically, he was a human when alive, but now his head is a lion when summoned as a Servant.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
However, since that doesn't affect his intelligence in the slightest it's not a problem. This lion, he's the definition of rationalism!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor! Everyone was taking a hint and not calling him the “L” word!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Well, he can't help it. I mean, he's basically a lion.   
   
**Edison:**   
A lion...I like the sound of that. Also, was that communication through magecraft?   
   
**Edison:**   
Even though you live in an age of telephones, your fixation with such an inconvenient method bewilders me.   
   
**Edison:**   
Mages by birth are indeed illogical creatures. Surely you can make better use of spiritual channels.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah, what? Look, phone lines only work when you occupy the same space in time, yes?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is far more functional, and crosses time and space in a kind of hyper-navigational form of communication...  
   
**Edison:**   
Oh. So that means you do not exist in this era!   
   
**Edison:**   
Hmm. To be able to communicate across different eras is quite convenient indeed...hmm.   
   
**Edison:**   
Magecraft and science are similar. There is nothing you can do that I cannot.   
   
**Edison:**   
I'd like to see if the same thing can be done by telephone. No, wait, I should develop a spirit phone before that...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Yes, yes, Mr. Edison. Please save your inventions for later, okay?   
   
**Edison:**   
...Oh, yes. Right.   
   
**Edison:**   
Your name is Fujimaru...was it? You are the only Master in this world.   
   
**Edison:**   
Let me get to the point. Can you lend us the strength that you used to correct the previous four eras to get rid of the Celts?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
How'd you know that?   
   
**Edison:**   
I am well aware. You see, a certain fellow took it upon himself to inform me.   
   
**Edison:**   
The world's worst good-for-nothing! That detestable hysteric told me...  
   
**Edison:**   
“While all these things happened, I am in good health. I bet you've never had such grand adventures, Edison”  
   
**Edison:**   
Truly the epitome of displeasure!   
   
**Edison:**   
&mdash;Ahem. Well, so much for that. Anyway, we must get rid of these Celts.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why get rid of the Celts?   
   
**Edison:**   
Hmm. I believe that is a self-evident truth.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Edison:**   
Needless to say, the Celts are an anachronism in this age.   
   
**Edison:**   
The United States is a cutting-edge nation created by capitalism and rationalism.   
   
**Edison:**   
This is our nation, and home to those with intellect.   
   
**Edison:**   
However, they keep multiplying like planarians, and the American army lost due to difference in the size of our forces.   
   
**Edison:**   
But fortunately, I, a Heroic Spirit, have descended upon this nation!   
   
**Edison:**   
The battlefront revived with my proposals of a new national structure and reformed military, equalizing the situation.   
   
**Edison:**   
Hmph&mdash;They truly are barbarians. Attempting to contend against me in mass production is the epitome of idiocy.   
   
**Edison:**   
Eventually my mechanized infantry will cover the land and annihilate the loathsome Celts once and for all.   
   
**Edison:**   
However...there is one matter that concerns me.... Leaders. In other words, we don't have enough Servants.   
   
**Edison:**   
We have an obedient army,but no mighty ace warrior to lead them.   
   
**Edison:**   
While enemy Celts have many notorious barbarians lined up.   
   
**Edison:**   
Just when we gain a foothold somewhere,we end up losing it to a single Servant.   
   
**Edison:**   
Only Servants can overcome other Servants. We only have three Servants on our side, including myself.   
   
**Edison:**   
Other Servants who were summoned are in disarray,and show no interest in joining us.   
   
**Edison:**   
Only my rationality restrains me from roaring out at this sad state of affairs.   
   
**Edison:**   
The Heroic Spirits meant to save America dread the enemy and refuse to fight. Their negligence is going too far!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This lion just roared!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...You're “rational,” right?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
C-Calm down, Mr. President!   
   
**Mash:**   
Umm...If you're trying to save the world, we are willing to cooperate with you...  
   
**Edison:**   
Oh! You understand! Truly wonderful! You also have a very delicious-looking body!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Foou!   
   
**Edison:**   
Hey, stop hitting and biting me, runt! That was figurative. I'd never assault a lady!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Can I ask you two questions?   
   
**Edison:**   
Yes, what is it? Coming from an exemplary woman like yourself, I shall give you a genteel answer.   
   
**Edison:**   
A gentleman's genteel reply&mdash; Oh, how elegant! Karna, please record that in the Presi-king Chronicles.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...My first question. On our way here, we saw the mechanized infantry several times...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Is that the result of your proposal? Is that what you aim for with your “new national structure? ”  
   
**Edison:**   
Indeed, that is correct! I arrived at this conclusion...in order to save the nation from its predicament!   
   
**Edison:**   
National unity! Citizens herded, no, rallied, to new life! Equal national service, regardless of age or gender!   
   
**Edison:**   
Eventually, all citizens will be part of the mechanized infantry and defeat the Celts, the invaders.   
   
**Edison:**   
Of course, we must maintain our mass-production lines for this purpose.   
   
**Edison:**   
Acquisition of labor from all across the land. Institution of 20-hour workdays. Unremitting surveillance.   
   
**Edison:**   
Of course, you need the best welfare system, too. One cannot have labor without recreation.   
   
**Edison:**   
We will play three times as hard, work three times as hard, and win three times as hard as normal humans! That's my new vision for America!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Playing three times as hard doesn't sound too bad...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's not okay! Recreation has its limits! Please just be normal!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Is he not aware of human limitations?   
   
**Mash:**   
I agree...Mr. Edison's plan does not take physical limitations into account whatsoever.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...So that is what you are fixated on.   
   
**Edison:**   
Hmm? What'd you just say?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
No, I was just talking to myself. Do not mind me.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Well then, my second question. How do you intend to save the world?   
   
**Mash:**   
That can be accomplished by securing the Holy Grail.   
   
**Mash:**   
Defeat the Celts, obtain the Holy Grail, then correct the era.   
   
**Mash:**   
While it is unclear who among the Celts possesses the Grail, if we can secure it, we can handle the rest...  
   
**Edison:**   
No, it is unnecessary to correct this era.   
   
**Mash:**   
What?   
   
**Edison:**   
It is unnecessary. If I acquire the Grail, I could refine it and we should be able to prevent the incineration of eras.   
   
**Edison:**   
Consequently, it would give birth to a world named “America” operating on a different timeline from the other eras.   
   
**Mash:**   
What...Is that really possible!?   
   
**Edison:**   
Having been summoned by the Grail, we Servants are well aware of its power. My conclusion is that it is quite possible.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What will happen to the other eras?   
  
---  
  
   
**Edison:**   
&ndash;They will probably be destroyed.   
   
**Mash:**   
Then, it's pointless to do so!   
   
**Edison:**   
What? Is there any other idea as brilliant as this?   
   
**Edison:**   
This America will survive for all eternity. My inventions will remake America.   
   
**Edison:**   
It will show those Celts, who can only procreate and fight, that my inventions are the lights of humanity, the power of civilization!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...So you expand your battlefront for that purpose? Abandoning those who fell in battle.   
   
**Edison:**   
...An accusation fit for Chief Nurse Nightingale, who so valiantly struggled for the salvation of all soldiers.   
   
**Edison:**   
I...I am...ugh...not abandoning them because I want to, however&mdash;  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Edison, calm down. Florence is just stating her opinion. It's not an accusation.   
   
**Edison:**   
I'm aware of that. That just now was my usual headache. Don't worry about it.   
   
**Edison:**   
Listen, Lady Nightingale.   
   
**Edison:**   
To us...To me, especially, this nation is everything. And a true king has a paramount duty to protect his nation.   
   
**Mash:**   
B-But!   
   
**Mash:**   
If you are a Heroic Spirit, you should also have a duty...an ideal, a wish, to protect the world!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...You are right. Even my current self possesses that sense of duty in one corner of my sanity.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Mr. Edison. If you deny that duty,you are nothing more than a mere patriot.   
   
**Edison:**   
Quite so. What is wrong with a king being a patriot?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...I see. In that case&mdash; There is only one thing for me to do!   
   
**Karna:**   
Nightingale, that's enough. I will not allow you to fight here.   
   
**Karna:**   
Even if that costs me my life.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Let go of me! I can tell! Leaders with those eyes always lead to destruction!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
And in the end he will irresponsibly declare...That “it wasn't supposed to turn out like this! ”  
   
**Edison:**   
Fujimaru...Master. What do you think?   
   
**Edison:**   
Shouldn't you join me to fight the Celts and acquire the Holy Grail? I'll give you three minutes to decide.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Maybe joining them for the time being is not a bad idea.   
   
**Mash:**   
What are you saying, Doctor!? He's opposed to the idea of fixing the Foundation of Humanity!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Quite the contrary, he's for it. It's just that the world he envisions differs from ours.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But we don't have the time to confront him now. And in the end, I think he'll stop baring his fangs.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm not just being hopeful. My conclusion stems from historical observation...and experience.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Those that move nations believing in their own righteousness will experience consequences, in one form or another.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...But that's all irrelevant. Now is about gaining the upper hand in the war.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
With all the Celtic Servants gathering,there is an overwhelming gap in military strength.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Diarmuid Ua Duibhne and Fionn mac Cumhaill are formidable enough. How many more Servants of that caliber do they have?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
For now, we will cooperate in order to acquire the Holy Grail, and correct the mistake where Celtic myths dominate North America.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What happens afterwards? We can think about that later.   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, what should we do? ...Senpai?   
   
**Edison:**   
Well then. Have you come to a decision? Let's hear what you have to say.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I have a bad feeling about this. I can't help.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Give up on the Holy Grail, President Lion.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Edison:**   
...That is an unexpected response indeed.   
   
**Edison:**   
Whatever your hidden agenda may be, I thought you would agree to join forces.   
   
**Edison:**   
I, Thomas Alva Edison, should respect your honesty and sincerity.   
   
**Edison:**   
But as presi-king, unfortunately I have no choice but to condemn you.   
   
**Edison:**   
Get 'em!   
   
**Mash:**   
They're coming! Stand back, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Hah, hah...No good, there's no end to them!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
!!!   
   
**Edison:**   
So even my prized mechanized infantry will become junk in minutes when going up against a Servant, huh?   
   
**Edison:**   
But sometimes it's quantity over quality. You should be out of energy already.   
   
**Edison:**   
&ndash;Blavatsky! Throw them inside the special underground jail!   
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Yeah, yeah. I guess it can't be helped. So sorry, but you're getting locked up.   
   
## Section 5: Cool Hand Florence   
   
**Mash:**   
...Those numbers just aren't fair.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But even after all that, they let us keep all our equipment.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fou is safe, too.   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.   
   
**Mash:**   
Not quite, Doctor. Just run an analysis and you'll know...  
   
**Mash:**   
The magical energy supply from Master is being cut off. And we have no way of escaping this jail...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
That's right. You can't really underestimate a Caster from the 19th century, can you?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Well, since I've lived on this continent before, my affinity with this land is not so bad.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Tell the guard if you're willing to cooperate. We'll let you out immediately.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...Tell me, Fujimaru. Why did you refuse?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
As the gentleman from Chaldea said,you could have just betrayed us along the way.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
At the very least, I'm sure you saw this coming. Yet you chose this foolish path.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Why?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
For Edison's sake.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...I see. True, I'm sure he'd be hurt if you'd betrayed him.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
In life, he was fed up by all the lawsuits. Despite the way he looks, he's naïve.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
He loves his country more than anyone and thinking that is only natural. No, he's obsessed. It's extreme self-righteous patriotism.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
But if you understand that, why are you helping him, Helena? Wouldn't he listen to your counsel?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
No. My approach can't save this country.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
For better or worse,only Mr. Edison can stop the Celtic army.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
That's why I'm with him for now. I do have obligations from when we were alive, too.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...However, Fujimaru,what you said makes me happy.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Please don't hate him too much. As the King of Inventions, he really is an amusing person, like a child.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
For Nightingale's sake.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
For my sake?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...I can see that. After all, Florence would never agree to those conditions.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
You never abandon someone once you've become allies, huh?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
As a Master and a human being, that's wonderful.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Though other people may think it's foolish...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...your actions are noble, more so than anybody else.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
&mdash;Rest easy. Someone will come to your rescue soon.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Until then, just wait here.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
We have to do something to get out of here. Please help me.   
   
**Mash:**   
I-I know, but I think it's impossible to destroy a cell with a gun!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
No, I think I've managed to shave off a little bit. Come on, everyone pitch in and dig!   
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, the bullets are ricocheting inside this cell! Nightingale, that's too reckless&ndash;!   
   
**D：???:**  
...Yes, that was reckless.   
   
**D：???:**  
But on the bright side, the sound of the gunshots let me find you quickly.   
   
**Mash:**   
A Servant?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, wait, a Servant you say? But I didn't detect anything at all!   
   
**D：???:**  
If I gave off a Servant response, we'd risk the possibility of that great hero of India finding us.   
   
**D：???:**  
It's thanks to this Noble Phantasm that I borrowed from that man...Just a moment. I'll get you out of there.   
   
**Mash:**   
Who on earth are you&ndash;?   
   
**D：???:**  
...Good question. I'm sure you can't trust me unless I tell you my name.   
   
**D：???:**  
That said, my True Name is not to be revealed lightly. Though even if I told you, you wouldn't know who I am.   
   
**D：???:**  
As such, you should just call me this. “Geronimo”...My name is Geronimo.   
   
**Mash:**   
Geronimo!   
   
**Mash:**   
The Apache shaman...You were summoned as a Caster, huh?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Strictly speaking, I'm far from being a shaman. I'm just a warrior.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Hero of the Apache! ...I see. There's no way he would follow Edison.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even though they live in the same land...Or, no, that's actually why they're so incompatible.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Strictly speaking, we should also be enemies, but this is no time for that.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
There, you're free. Now you should be able to receive magical energy again.   
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
I'd like to escape...But first we need to take down the mechanized infantry guarding the place.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
I'm sure Karna will notice us at that point. It'll take everything you have to escape.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Are you ready?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's do it, Mash!   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right&mdash;I'm not used to bullets yet, but I'll do my best!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Geronimo:**   
...All right! They're down! But Karna must have noticed. Follow me, quickly!   
   
**Mash:**   
Th-This place is bigger than I thought!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
In this era, land is the only thing there's plenty of.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mr. Geronimo. Do you mind if I ask you something?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
You don't have to raise your voice, mage. I can hear you. What is it?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In Eastern and Western America, the Celts and Edison have raised armies and are at war. This we understand.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But do you know of any other Servants who we speculate were summoned as countermeasures?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Yes, there are three other...No, two other Servants that fight with me. I'll introduce you after we escape.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
It seems there are many more Servants who have been summoned here to America, though.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...But we're short on military strength, so we had to act very carefully.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
To be honest, the Celtic army is picking us off one by one.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
But if you join us, we'll be able to take decisive action.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Wait a moment. I have one question.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
What is it, angel? ...I take that back. I was inappropriate. My apologies.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Go ahead.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
If memory serves me correctly, Geronimo, you were once at war with this nation.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...That's right.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
If this era is corrected, you will be treated as a warrior who failed.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Is that still all right?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
I don't mind.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Victory or defeat, in the end, it's no more than a point embedded in the flow of time.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Crushing this era would mean that my brothers and I shed all this blood for nothing.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
It's simple to pretend something doesn't exist. It's even easier if that something is disadvantageous to yourself.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Even so, being able to acknowledge something is what makes us warriors. Only a sly coyote would pretend something doesn't exist.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Too much irony for my taste.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...I see. Then for now, I can think of you as an ally, yes?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
I wouldn't want to try fooling a gaze that could even shoot a sun down. Ah, here's the exit&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...As expected. I'm picking up one powerful Servant.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Outwitting him was too much to ask. But we can't turn back now.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Push through!   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Karna:**   
So it is you, Geronimo.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
I didn't want to meet the great hero of the Mahabharata under these circumstances.   
   
**Karna:**   
I did not wish to encounter the great man who bravely confronted a nation under these circumstances, either.   
   
**Karna:**   
However, I must raise my spear now that we're being attacked. Don't worry, I won't let the mechanized infantry interfere.   
   
**Karna:**   
This will be a battle just between me and all of you. &ndash;So, prepare to fight.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Listen, Fujimaru. It seems he doesn't expect this to be a battle to the death.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Normally, the odds would be against us, but now that he isn't going all out, we might still have a chance if we can send him flying.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
He's a Lancer. Summon Servants that are advantageous against him and unleash Noble Phantasms before he does. Got it?   
   
**Karna:**   
It seems you're ready. Then here I come!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Karna:**   
Ugh...  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Somehow we pushed him back! Master, now's the time!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's escape!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's retreat!   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Now! Run, run&ndash;!   
   
**Karna:**   
This is as far as I go...Edison. It seems that the clock has started ticking.   
   
**Karna:**   
You have asked me for help, so I'll stay until the end...But what can we do to avoid a catastrophe?   
   
## Section 6: Rama Got His Sword   
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning, Senpai. Are you awake?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good morning, Mash.   
   
**Mash:**   
That nap was exactly three hours. Rest when you can. That's the spirit.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where are we?   
   
**Mash:**   
Geronimo said to take a nap since it's going to be a long journey, but...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Relax. This is a small town in the West. The residents have already evacuated, likely due to the Celts' fierce attacks.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
The only people on this land now are those who have come to our side.   
   
**Soldier:**   
It's Geronimo!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Is he all right?   
   
**Soldier:**   
The life force of Servants is incredible. I can't say he's fine, but he's breathing anyway.   
   
**Mash:**   
There's a Servant here?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Yes. Actually, we're sheltering the third Servant I mentioned here.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Of course I'm helping you because I want your help in return, but most of all, it's to get him medical treatment.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
In other words, the spotlight is on me. Not like it matters...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
If there's a patient who seeks treatment, I will tend to him.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Yes, please. In your care, he may yet have a chance.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
All right, bring him out!   
   
**D：???:**  
Ungh...  
   
**Mash:**   
...Horrible...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A part of his heart has been gouged out! I'm shocked he's still alive!   
   
**D：???:**  
Well...Endurance...is...my strong suit...Ugh...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;I've never seen a wound like this before. But I can't turn you away.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Don't worry, young man. Even if you end up in hell, I'll drag you out.   
   
**D：???:**  
Hnngh...That does sound...promising!   
   
**D：???:**  
Ah, owwww! C-Can't you be a little more gentle!?   
   
**D：???:**  
Do you understand? My heart is crushed!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I'm surprised you can even talk.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Anyway, I'll heal you. First, your heart is about to lose all functionality.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Because of that, blood cannot circulate properly in your body...I must cut it out.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...All limbs, I mean. And if possible, I'll take all organs out except your lungs too!   
   
**D：???:**  
W-Wait, wait, wait! Focus on repairing just my heart, no amputation!   
   
**D：???:**  
I cannot lose any means to fight!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
What are you talking about? There is no greater joy than being alive!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
As an individual life form who has taken root on this earth, you have a duty to survive, come what may!   
   
**D：???:**  
Th-That's easy for you to say!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
It's all right. I swear that I'll heal you...I swear it!   
   
**Mash:**   
...So, who is he? He doesn't seem like a Servant from this country...  
   
**D：???:**  
Y-You mean me? I am Rama! The great king of Kosala!   
   
**Rama:**   
For more details...Owowowowow! Read the Ramayana! That's all!   
   
**Rama:**   
Aaaah, dammit! That really hurts!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Frustrating. Frustrating, frustrating, frustrating, frustrating!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
No matter how much I slow down the speed of encroaching death, I cannot stop it!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
No, I won't give up. As long as this body is alive, I'll fulfill my duty!   
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, Nightingale, be more gentle! Who were you fighting that could give you such a wound?   
   
**Rama:**   
It was inevitable...After all, my opponent...was Cú Chulainn, Ireland's strongest hero.   
   
**Mash:**   
Cú Chulainn!?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ahhh...Of course. If Celtic warriors are the enemy,then naturally he would be around...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Cú Chulainn...Ireland's most renowned hero, nicknamed the Child of Light.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They say if he aims his lance, Gáe Bolg,it always pierces his target's heart.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I suppose it would be difficult to avoid that,even if you are the hero of the Ramayana.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...More like, it's a miracle you're still alive.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Preventing the collapse of our front lines is important, but I want to heal Rama.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
When I heard about a Servant concentrating on healing soldiers, I brought you here&mdash; Hmmm?   
   
**Mash:**   
That voice...from the sky.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Tch. Scouts. I'll wipe out every last one of them.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...I have a favor to ask of you all. At this rate, the boy's condition isn't going to improve.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
His heart should've been repaired just now, but more than 10% of it is starting to deteriorate again.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
A bottomless bucket...Well, not that bad, but without continuous treatment he will die quickly.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
This is completely due to my own incompetence.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
However, I do not want to give up on him. I will not give up on him.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
This boy wants to live so badly.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
As long as he possesses the will to live, I will never give up on him!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;Tell me how to do this. How to treat him. Tell me that which I do not know!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Doctor. Please give us your analysis concerning Rama's injury.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. You don't need to send me any detailed data. I can tell at a glance. It's a curse.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Removing the curse takes precedence over treatment. The fastest way is to defeat the person who injured him.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Gáe Bolg is said to be a demonic spear or technique wielded by Cú Chulainn&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In any case, there's no doubt that it was a blow that, if left untended, will destroy the heart.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's basically a miracle that Rama is still alive. Normally, I wouldn't be surprised to see him already dead...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Or rather, it's strange he's not dead.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Then again, this is Rama, hero of the Ramayana, one of India's two epic poems. If anybody can perform a miracle, it's him.   
   
**Rama:**   
Indeed. You should praise me even more...Ouch.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's more accurate to say that Rama reversed his state of death through sheer willpower.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Basically, the fact that Rama is alive is an “error” in the proper cause-and-effect flow of this world.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Doctor Roman, please correct yourself. I do not think it is an error that he is alive.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Take your finger off that trigger! Please, just hear what I have to say!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As I said earlier, the only way to save him is to eliminate the spear that can distort cause and effect.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
However&ndash;I can tell how difficult that is even by monitoring events from over here.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Besides Cú Chulainn, it's certain that there are at least two more Servants.   
   
**Rama:**   
Exactly. This is quite literally a war that we are in.   
   
**Rama:**   
Were I to stage a one-man attack, only death would greet me. Ugh...I'm sorry, please continue your treatment!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You don't need to tell me. Please sit still.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
However, we do have one thing in our favor. This world's state is unstable.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Just like how the Celtic warriors continue to be summoned and fight to the death despite their precarious existences...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If we can somehow strengthen Rama's existence, we can remove the distortion cast on him, or close to it.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Is that similar to how we broke Siegfried's curse when we were in France?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. The best thing would be to make contact with a Servant who knew him when he was alive.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Knowing the “blueprint” of his body when he was alive will likely increase the efficacy of Ms. Nightingale's treatment.   
   
**Rama:**   
...I know someone. A Servant that meets your criteria exists in this world.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Who, exactly?   
   
**Rama:**   
Ah, hmm. It's embarrassing to say, but...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...You can't mean Eli  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, stop! Loose lips sink ships, as they say.   
   
**Mash:**   
If you utter that name in a place like this, there is no doubt she will be summoned.   
   
**Fou:**   
Kyuu, foou.   
   
**Rama:**   
Huh...Eli? Unfortunately, you are quite off the mark.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Another was summoned from the same era as me&mdash;my wife, Sita.   
   
**Rama:**   
I have not seen her yet, but I am certain that she is being held captive somewhere in this world.   
   
**Rama:**   
I crossed blades with Cú Chulainn in order to find her location.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see. Your wife, Sita. You may have dragged her here when you were summoned.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If we find her, it may be possible to cure you.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...I see. At present, Rama is unquestionably the strongest among the Servants who have been summoned.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
At full strength, he would likely be an equal match for Karna.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
I want to save him if I can. We must locate his wife Sita as soon as possible.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
For that purpose, I would like Nightingale to accompany me&ndash;  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Hm? I'd go with you to the ends of the earth. Got a problem?   
   
**Rama:**   
Truly!? I feel reassured, but you don't need the details!?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Why must I abandon my patient? Especially if there is no one besides me who can save him.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
With that in mind...I believe it is worth seeking a somewhat more effective nursing method.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Rama, please excuse me. Don't struggle too much.   
   
**Rama:**   
Wh-What!? You can carry me so easily!? This is how I used to carry Sita!   
   
**Rama:**   
...Isn't that how you carry a princess?   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh...  
   
**Rama:**   
Hey, put me down! What am I to do if my people witness me in this state!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I do not mind. I am used to violent patients. This way, please. We must also prepare a special belt.   
   
**Rama:**   
Let me go! Let! Me! Go!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Oh, uh...That was quick. You are truly the angel feared...uh, I mean, adored by all soldiers.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
...What's wrong, Doctor? You seem disheartened...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, it's nothing...I mean, Rama is still young, right? Yet he has a wife...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
And you're still single at thirty, eh!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yet you're still single at thirty...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I can't read your expression, Fujimaru! Are you sympathizing with me or laughing at me?   
   
**Mash:**   
? That is true, but I think it's strange for the Doctor to feel inferior.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Shouldn't he feel inferior?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
N-No, I mean&mdash; I believe the Doctor has, uh, been married previously...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Whaaaaaaaaaat!?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
When did that happen!?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What? Mash, why did you have to blurt out something like that!?   
   
**Mash:**   
But it's true. This one time I saw the Doctor washing his hands and there was a&mdash;  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Ahem. Sorry, but can we get back to the subject? We're quite pressed for time, too.   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh...that's right. I apologize. Please continue.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Besides healing Rama, we also need to figure out how to deal with Edison and the Celtic soldiers.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
I suppose Mr. Mage in the other world has some kind of plan in mind?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Of course. While Fujimaru is on the front lines, my job is to collect data and analyze it.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Recall earlier when we&ndash;or Mash Kyrielight, rather, fought with Fionn mac Cumhaill.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He muttered something that bothered me.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
“They're monsters born indefinitely from our queen. Even if we lose a few thousand here, it won't be a problem for us! ”  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In other words...the Celtic soldiers may be able to multiply infinitely.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If that's true, normal attacks are useless. Reducing their numbers won't work as a strategy.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...That did briefly cross my mind. But it's overwhelming to hear someone say it outright.   
   
**Mash:**   
Does Edison's mechanized infantry follow the same principle?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's probably fair to say so.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The only way to counter Celtic soldiers, who wouldn't flinch at the loss of thousands, is through mass production.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As an inventor, Edison did not try to pioneer anything&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
His talent lay in modifying other people's cutting-edge inventions so that they became more accessible.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Without Edison, the telephone, the light bulb, and many other so-called “modern conveniences”...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...would have developed at an unimaginably sluggish pace.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Moreover, America's pride is its ability to develop war-machines on a massive scale.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
I see. Perhaps it's natural for the King of Inventions to call himself this nation's king.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
However, it's a troubling idea for us mages: mass production will lower the value of all Mystics.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
At any rate, there's only one course of action I can recommend.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Assassination&ndash; Use Servants to take out both the king and queen at the same time.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Facing them head-on and wasting our resources is exactly what they want.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
With an enemy that can multiply troops indefinitely, the only solution is to target their leader!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
&mdash;Exactly. Well put, Doctor.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
You must be quite a famous mage. Your voice alone seems unreliable, but that intelligence is anything but.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Even Geronimo has to point that out...I wonder just what's wrong with my image...  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou.   
   
**Mash:**   
Excuse me, Doctor. Fou just said, “Geronimo hit the nail on the head. ”  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hey, I'm well aware that I'm kind of a wimp, okay!?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...All right. To make sure this assassination succeeds,let's unite all the Servants scattered in different areas.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Once we come together, we will make a stand against the Celtic soldiers and Edison.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...We need to make sure to return this land to the hands of its people!   
   
## Section 7: Young Guns   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Sorry to do this while we walk,but let me explain the situation again.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
I have confirmed the presence of two Servants, both Archers. You'll have to ask them for their True Names.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Both are infamous Servants who specialize in guerrilla warfare.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Unless they run into a particularly powerful enemy, they are unlikely to lose in combat.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
But they're at a big disadvantage in terms of numbers.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Even though these Archers excel at guerrilla warfare, the best they can achieve is reducing the extent of the damage.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Celtic soldiers are laying waste to the land as they please. Such savagery is easy to identify.   
   
**Mash:**   
Savagery...As they please...Are they not all united in one group?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Not objectively speaking. But, it's obvious that their purpose is seizing control of this land.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
So they probably have one objective, but how they accomplish that is left up to each individual.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
The literature suggests that Celtic soldiers can be downright vicious and ferocious.   
   
**Rama:**   
...Indeed.   
   
**Rama:**   
As far as I saw, Cú Chulainn massacred all opposing soldiers.   
   
**Rama:**   
His nickname is “Child of Light? ” What a joke. He's truly fallen into darkness already...Ugh!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
By the way, what happened to you, Rama?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Rama, why are you being carried like that?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Rama:**   
This wasn't my idea! It was this iron-like nurse who...ugh!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Fujimaru. Please try not to disturb the patient.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
This is an emergency transportation device I devised. It's not a mere body bag. It's a Rama bag.   
   
**Rama:**   
U-Ugh...To be carted around by a woman...How humiliating.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Gender and age are irrelevant for patients. Do not forget that you have a severe injury and cannot walk.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
&mdash;Well.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
The Western American army forces civilians into factories, making them work on the mechanized infantry's mass production.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wow. Edison has become a dictator.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
I heard many have sought refuge for the time being, saying it's better than being slain by the Celts.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
The war between the East and the West is at a stalemate. While it's a relief that we don't need to worry about the civilians at this stage...  
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Wait, hide!   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Looks like scouts. If we let even one escape, they'll call reinforcements.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Understood. I shall hurry to cut off their escape route...huh?   
   
**Mash:**   
Umm, Master. What happened to Nightingale?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm. She has already pounced on the scouts with a vengeance.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I shall purify the source of the illness! Time for your medical exam. Now, open your chest for me!   
   
**Rama:**   
W-Wait!? Do you intend to fight while still carrying me!?   
   
**Rama:**   
Wait, hey, my wound...Argh, that hurts!   
   
**Mash:**   
M-Master, I will be right back!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Annihilation complete. Excellent work, hygienically speaking.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, Nightingale?   
   
**Mash:**   
We planned to surround the enemies before battle, so if you rush in on your own, it causes us trouble...  
   
**Rama:**   
And don't go off fighting with me on your back...I'm your patient, remember...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Healing my patients is always my top priority. All other matters are not my concern.   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai. Senpai. Nightingale won't listen to us.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fofooou...  
   
**Rama:**   
Hey, Fujimaru. It'd be nice if you did something about this...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But she's a Berserker.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But she's Nightingale.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...You're right...I'm beginning to realize that a conviction so strong you can't compromise is a type of Madness Enhancement too...  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Yes. Whether she's like this after becoming a Servant, or if she was like this in life is rather scary to contemplate...  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Luckily, we may reach our destination before that.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Two Archers are in the town ahead. Considering the earlier scout, they're most certainly under attack.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's just as he said, Fujimaru. I've confirmed the presence of multiple enemies and Servants.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They seem to be surrounding the town. Hurry!   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. Let's get going, Senpai!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
 Huh? Where's Nightingale?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...She's gone. On top of that,Rama, who she was carrying on her back, is gone too.   
   
**Mash:**   
L-Let's run!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**F：???:**  
Huh? Did you hear something just now?   
   
**E：???:**  
Hmm...It sounds like people fighting, or something. Have our reinforcements arrived?   
   
**F：???:**  
The tables have turned! Old Man Geronimo's finally done it!   
   
**E：???:**  
...Hey, hey, Green?   
   
**E：???:**  
Remind me. Is Geronimo a woman with a medical bag, toting a gun and carrying a kid on her back?   
   
**F：???:**  
...Huh? What's that scary-sounding thing? Not even our banshee is that scary.   
   
**Rama:**   
Why, you...You didn't listen to a word of what the others were saying, did you?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Yes, I did! That good hygiene is the basis of all healing! So I shall now disinfect them all at full power!   
   
**Rama:**   
You're such a...Argh! You...Mash! Fujimaru! Hurry up and rescue me already!   
   
**Mash:**   
...A-Anyway, in this situation,there's only one thing we can do.   
   
**Mash:**   
We need to protect Nightingale!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Leave the cover fire to me! Go!   
   
**Mash:**   
All right! Mash Kyrielight&ndash;going in!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;Do not interfere with my treatment!   
   
**Rama:**   
How should I say it...This is ridiculous...  
   
**E：???:**  
Hey, hey! Hey, you! You're an ally, right? I think?   
   
**Rama:**   
Are you one of the Archers Geronimo was talking about?   
   
**E：???:**  
Oh, good. So you ARE an ally! Hey, Green! They're allies!   
   
**F：???:**  
That's good to hear. Really good.   
   
**F：???:**  
Most of the enemies are gone now, but I was afraid we'd have to go against that scary lady next.   
   
**Rama:**   
Oh, how long have you been there?   
   
**F：???:**  
It's my skill, don't worry about it. As for me, I'm more interested in the fact that you're being carried on her back.   
   
**Rama:**   
&ndash;Please, just don't ask. It's an excessively long and convoluted story.   
   
**E：???:**  
Hey, hey! Are those people charging at us our allies too?   
   
**Rama:**   
Yes. They are very reliable allies.... At least more than myself right now!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Most of the Celtic warriors have been eliminated&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm picking up a strong enemy response! It's a big one...  
   
**Mash:**   
It's not another dragon, is it!?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No. This&ndash;is a new type of demonic beast. Please be cautious!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Oh, seeing animals here. Just how unsanitary can this place get!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
And there're so many different kinds...A true hotbed of bacteria. I'll get triple the disinfectant ready!   
   
**Rama:**   
I see, so that's the first thought in your mind seeing this? You're amazing, Nightingale!   
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;Let's go, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...We won! But for some reason...I feel more exhausted than usual...  
   
**Mash:**   
Are you all right, Nightingale? Let me treat your wounds&ndash;  
   
**Nightingale:**   
I am a nurse, I understand my body more than anyone. I can still move. Wounds like these will heal themselves.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But you're bleeding.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
What of it? On the battlefield my blood is as precious as their blood.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
If shedding my own blood spares others from spilling their own, I will gladly do so.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
As someone who's joined the military, that's the only mission possible for me.   
   
**Mash:**   
...What should we do, Senpai?   
   
**E：???:**  
Hey, are you the reinforcements Geronimo mentioned?   
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes. You must be the ones he spoke about...  
   
**E：???:**  
Yep, the pair in a solitary struggle. My True Name is...I'll just tell you, since it's too troublesome otherwise.   
   
**E：???:**  
I'm Robin Hood, Archer class. And this guy with me here is&ndash;  
   
**D：???:**  
What the heck? You just blurted it out? No fair. Then I guess there's no reason I should keep mine a secret.   
   
**D：???:**  
I'm William Henry McCarty, Jr. Though people call me&ndash;Billy the Kid!   
   
**Billy:**   
To protect this nation, it looks like I, a Servant from this nation, was chosen.   
   
**Billy:**   
I'm an Archer, of course. Nice to meet you!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
I'm glad both of you are alive and well.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
This is the Demi-Servant, Mash Kyrielight, and this is her Master, Fujimaru.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nice to meet you.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yes, good to meet you. Well, at least we're not fighting all on our own anymore now.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Just you two?   
   
**Billy:**   
There are some townsfolk who couldn't evacuate. They're injured.   
   
**Mash:**   
So that's why Nightingale rushed off like that...  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Just like a coyote catching the scent of blood.... Maybe that metaphor was a bit rude.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
They're quite weakened, but their lives aren't in danger.   
   
**Billy:**   
Thank goodness!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Billy:**   
So, um&ndash; Fujimaru? What should we do now?   
   
**Mash:**   
Right, let me explain our current situation.   
   
**Billy:**   
...Ah, okay. Heal this Rama kid, find more firepower for our party, and&mdash;  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Assassinate the enemy leader. That works, doesn't it? Sounds like an appropriate course of action.   
   
**Billy:**   
As expected of someone who's been fighting as the Faceless King, you really don't hesitate.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Both of us are used to doing dirty jobs. Right, Boy Outlaw King?   
   
**Billy:**   
Ah, ha, ha! Well, of course! I'm not gonna deal with guys that spawn infinitely.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Considering our lopsided class distribution,we could really use a Saber or Lancer in our lineup.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Having only Mash on the front line leaves our formation unreliable...Especially when Nightingale runs off on her own.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
The ideal Servant would be someone summoned to this era who has no connection to the Celts...  
   
**Billy:**   
I don't think anyone I know has been summoned.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
What is lacking the most in this world are nurses. Second to that are doctors.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&ndash;Oof. I'm not picking up any Servant responses in the vicinity.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If you can wait a bit, I'll expand the scan range.   
   
**Mash:**   
Until we detect a Servant,I guess we have to patiently keep scouting the area?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
......  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Something wrong?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's up?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Oh, just...I guess, um, before I teamed up with this guy, I met some...  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
A Saber and a Lancer. Well...I mean, they were a Saber and a Lancer, but...  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
They're, like, ultra-problematic children?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Huh? Do they have Madness Enhancement? Or are they Anti-Heroes?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
One's definitely an Anti-Hero. But you can communicate with both of them.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
But they were, I guess you'd say...Well, you'll see when you meet them.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Just don't blame me when you do, okay?   
   
**Mash:**   
With our current situation, no matter how problematic the Servant is, we could use their aid.   
   
**Mash:**   
When things get dire, Senpai will be able to unite us. Right, Master?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, I'll figure something out.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah, let's make sure things don't get dire.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Well, that's reassuring. You've fought beside some pretty troublesome folks, huh?   
   
## Section 8: My Fair Lady   
   
**Medb:**   
Oh, really? And then you came running back. How pathetic.   
   
**Fionn:**   
Yes. I am very sorry.   
   
**Medb:**   
Hey, Cú...What should we do with them?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...What? Yeah, whatever. I don't care.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
They're not kids. They're allowed two mistakes. This is their first. They're off the hook for now.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
However, there won't be a third. Don't waste my time, got that?   
   
**Fionn:**   
Understood. Then Diarmuid, let's go.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Yes.   
   
**Medb:**   
How naive! Cú, you need to be a lot more strict to people like that!   
   
**Medb:**   
You need to be more like an animal. An animal!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
No. Animals are free until they die. Unfortunately, I'm a king.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
The first time, I forgive their carelessness. The second time, I praise their narrow defeat. The third time, I resign myself to the fact that they're weak.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
That, I don't need.   
   
**E：???:**  
That opinion still suits you even after falling to darkness. Your ferocity against enemies, on the other hand, does not suit you.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...So it's you.   
   
**E：???:**  
Surely it's you who called me.   
   
**Medb:**   
No, that would be me.   
   
**E：???:**  
Oh, Medb, is it? What's wrong? No one to warm your bed at night? I'd be happy to oblige.   
   
**Medb:**   
No. Rest assured that I have no issue in that area. Actually, I have a bit of news from an earlier report.   
   
**Medb:**   
Servants aiming to “correct” this world have appeared. Enemies trying to return this nation to how it used to be.   
   
**E：???:**  
Interesting. How audacious. Are those the ones whom Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne ran into?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
If you're bored, you go. They're strong enough, they shouldn't disappoint you.   
   
**E：???:**  
Oh, by myself?   
   
**Medb:**   
No, they're trying to meet up with one another. So you could sneak ahead, take those Servants and&ndash;  
   
**E：???:**  
Oh, I see. In other words, pick them off one by one before they all meet up.   
   
**E：???:**  
Acceptable. That should be simple enough.   
   
**Medb:**   
Thank you, Fergus. When you return, maybe I'll keep you company for a night?   
   
**Fergus:**   
&ndash;Hmm, oh, no, no. I'll pass after all.   
   
**Fergus:**   
I finally got my second life. It's not bad to be greedy&ndash;But being celibate every so often can't hurt.   
   
**Fergus:**   
I'll dedicate all my vigor to combat. I'll let my surging animal instincts guide me.   
   
**Fergus:**   
Don't you feel the same way?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;No. I won't get all enthusiastic over a battle that will end once I kill everyone.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
My task is to flatten this whole nation. Minor skirmishes with foot soldiers are mere drudgery.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I'll fulfill my destined role. Before I die, this nation will become an uninhabited wasteland.   
   
**Fergus:**   
I see...In spite of that, you're quite...  
   
**Fergus:**   
Never mind. Something about friendships and hedges. Now, my queen, if you'll excuse me!   
   
**Medb:**   
Good luck. I love you, Fergus♪  
   
**Fergus:**   
Hmph. Except for your body, you're the worst woman ever. However, you do have a sharp eye for good men!   
   
**Medb:**   
Well, how will they react? We're up against Rama and Geronimo, right?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
And that one group.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Do they have a strong sense of purpose? Of duty? Or no reason at all? ...At any rate, what a nuisance.   
   
**Medb:**   
Cú, you've changed so much. You've become more regal.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...I'm still my old self. Everybody has moments when they're not so eager to fight.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
That's just how I'm feeling at the moment.   
   
**Medb:**   
I suppose. The animalistic side of you lusts for fulfilling battles and love.   
   
**Medb:**   
And the empty, hollow side of you is bored of battle, and just stoically deals with things.   
   
**Medb:**   
When summoned as a Servant,which side manifests is a matter of chance.   
   
**Medb:**   
Admittedly, you're basically one of my creations. I'm quite astounded at our compatibility.   
   
**Medb:**   
To be sure, I love both sides of you, Cú. I love you&ndash; Really, truly.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Shut up. You're annoying.   
   
**Medb:**   
&ndash;You're so spiteful. Hehehe.   
   
**Medb:**   
That aside, half of Eastern America has already fallen.   
   
**Medb:**   
We've killed George Washington and exterminated the majority of the nation's leaders.   
   
**Medb:**   
...I thought the battle was won. Who would've known that the West would unite to oppose us?   
   
**Medb:**   
“Edison,” was it? I didn't expect a mere human to go this far.   
   
**Medb:**   
The worst thing is that they have Karna on their side.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Fool. I told you to mow them down while they were still weak.   
   
**Medb:**   
Look, I didn't think a mere “King of Inventions” would go this far!   
   
**Medb:**   
I can't shake the feeling that he has some kind of backing. Something besides the Holy Grail.   
   
**Medb:**   
Otherwise, it's impossible to explain how he can oppose us as much as he has.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Hmm. That's alarming.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Well, I'll go and deal with him in time. Make sure our preparations are in order.   
   
**Medb:**   
Yes, of course.   
   
**Medb:**   
Well, Cú. Let's dream together. A dream as pleasant as a nightmare.   
   
**Medb:**   
When we awake, I'm sure things will have moved forward. Hopefully it will be something to celebrate&ndash; Hehehe.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...Ugh, I'm so depressed. Completely run-down.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Why do I have to travel to America's remote regions just to see those guys...  
   
**Mash:**   
? What is holding you back? Did you meet them when you were alive?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Of course not. I never met such an overwhelming group when I was human.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
But it still feels like we're inextricably linked. Like we're connected, but still apart, you know?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ex-girlfriend?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Girlfriend?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, I see. So that was the reason. Robin, I underestimated you.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hey, Fujimaru...Don't pull such scary stuff out of that imagination of yours.   
   
**Billy:**   
But that's what it sounded like he was talking about. Don't you all agree?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Who cares?   
   
**Rama:**   
...I am ignorant of such matters. I am dedicated to my wife, Sita.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
What? A “girlfriend”...Is that the name of a new antibiotic?   
   
**Billy:**   
Oh, this is pointless! Nobody here has a sense of humor!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I think they settled down around here...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Whoa. I'm getting enemy readings, so watch out!   
   
**Mash:**   
Okay. Master, let's go!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Wait. Huh?   
   
**Billy:**   
Don't these guys seem kind of weak? Well, whatever. I guess that's good for us.   
   
**Billy:**   
Okay, let's do this!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
They're weak, but there are so many of them. I wonder why they're so weak.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...Is it, maybe? No, there's no way...there's no way.   
   
**Mash:**   
Is something wrong?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
It's nothing. Let's get on with this. We're not finished here yet.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Billy:**   
Yup, they were weak!   
   
**Mash:**   
But they're the same Celtic soldiers we've been fighting, right? Seems like they fought something else before us&ndash;  
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Hmm?   
   
**Billy:**   
Geronimo, what's wrong?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
No, I just heard a weird sound&ndash;  
   
**Billy:**   
Oh, you're right. What is that...exactly?   
   
**Billy:**   
Each individual sound is beautiful, but when you put them together, they feel murky, like mud...  
   
**Billy:**   
It's like when you use red, blue, yellow, green, and pink paint...and the canvas goes all black.   
   
**Mash:**   
Please wait, Master. I feel like we've heard this song somewhere.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's just your imagination-tion-tion!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's an auditory illusion-sion-sion!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, the way you are ending your sentences is very strange!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Ugh. Is she still singing...  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
♪My heart is prickling...Romance in a box♪A little girl's iron maiden!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
♪You're so cute I'll lock you up♪ Shower you with bloody kisses and skewer you like kebabs!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
♪Don't fool around! Don't fall in love♪'Cause I'm always by your side, okay?   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Geronimo:**   
...  
   
**Billy:**   
...  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh, wait a minute. I should have ended that “okay” on a much springier, livelier note. Definitely.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Then I'd do a cute little spin, and slap my tail at the audience.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It's so fun to practice! I feel like I'm just getting more and more charming! It's great!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
If I say so myself, it's scary how perfect I am...Adding all these practices on top of my natural talent...I am entering godhood!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Heh heh, just you wait, Saber. Next time we meet, I'll be way different!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Excuse me, Master.   
   
**Mash:**   
I believe the situation calls for you to say something that should be said.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Me?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why me?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. There is only one thing to say. Senpai, I have faith in you. You can do it.   
   
**Mash:**   
Okay&mdash; Go ahead!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Aren't you embarrassed showing up so many times?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Aren't you embarrassed showing up so many times?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What? Who has the nerve to hurl slander at an idol?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hey, I didn't ask to be summoned, okay!? I mean, who wouldn't want a wonderful world tour anyway!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Well, if it isn't the [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] and Friends!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? Oh, the green mouse is also with you. What do you want?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hey, don't remember people by color! ...So, you're still singing here, I see.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
YES.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I mean, this is the ultimate entertainment hell where all the pigs filled with desire gather, and its name is&ndash;  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Broadway!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Broadway?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What, you've never heard of it? It's the home of musicals! Oh, the glory of Broadway!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It's a glittering hub of entertainment! A sparkling paradise for artistic expression...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Well, this place is just a hillbilly town at the moment. It is none other than I who deemed it Broadway!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
So here and there are the only places in America that are worth anything. Hehe, I can see it now.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
All the pigs enchanted by my singing voice flock around me here, one after another&ndash;  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Eventually I'll have everything built here. My own stage, my own theater, my own cinema.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'll reign over it all as an unscalable magical tower! The only other thing I need is...Right, a statue of me!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
A super statue, 500 meters tall,faithfully capturing my exquisite beauty!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
As the goddess of fresh blood, I'll raise my voice in song with a tomato in one hand and end the cutthroat world of idols!   
   
**Billy:**   
...Could someone stop her? Please?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hey, don't look at me like that! I don't want to! Look, uh, everyone has the right to dream!   
   
**Billy:**   
Hahaha. Delusions aren't dreams, and with how she is now, her dreams won't come true even after a century passes.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Treating damaged vocal cords is one thing,but curing delusions is beyond my expertise.   
   
**Mash:**   
......  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? ...I am very sorry, Master.   
   
**Mash:**   
My mind wandered off for a moment there. Elisabeth, this is our third meeting!   
   
**Mash:**   
If you'll allow me to be frank, I believe your only audience is Celtic soldiers eager to pounce on you!   
   
**Mash:**   
Your beautiful voice won't reach their hearts. They hear only the death throes of a hungry dragon!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Huh?   
   
**Billy:**   
Oh, I finally get it. Why those guys we ran into earlier were so weak.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
You do? Me, too!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
I get it, too.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I was getting so fired up because so many fans wanted to get near me...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Is it true that those half-naked macho men were just a bunch of fools incapable of understanding my art?   
   
**Mash:**   
Correct! Those fellows would be quite out of place on your stage.   
   
**Mash:**   
As a fan, my advice to you is to unleash your song at the right place and time!   
   
**Mash:**   
In order to promote your art(istically atrocious singing), I humbly beseech you to lend us your strength!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nice job, Mash!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Oh, so that's your plan...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
&ndash;I see. I don't really get it, but I'm convinced.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Basically, you need my power, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh...Well, I can't say “no” when a passionate fan asks me to do something.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You've passed, Mash! I, Elisabeth Báthory, henceforth pledge my microphone to your Master!   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes! Thank you so much!   
   
**Billy:**   
...I see. So that's how you're supposed to talk to that dumb dragon...  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I had a feeling she loved to be flattered. But there's no way I could so desperately beg her for anything.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...We are Servants. Thus, once we achieve our goal, we have no choice but to return to the Throne.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...In the end, will she really have enough time to build her own Broadway?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That is to remain unsaid, Old Man Geronimo.   
   
**Billy:**   
So, where's the next one?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
We're going to pass through the eastern forest. Saber's in the town on the other side.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Another...Saber?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Right, Saber. An equal match for our Lancer here.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Umm...are you perhaps referring to the “red” one?   
   
**Billy:**   
? You can tell your Sabers apart based on whether they're red or blue?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I see, I see. Basically you're recruiting other members for me. I'm your vocalist, so...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh, I've got it! An assistant director, right? Lighting, seating, acoustics! Yup, those are important!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Let's go, Mash, Fujimaru. I meant to say this earlier, but thanks for what you did for me in France!   
   
**Mash:**   
Not at all. It is we who should extend our gratitude...Thank you very much.   
   
**Mash:**   
The Saber class is an indispensable part of the group. Let's go.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Ah! What's up with this forest? It's so big! I'm scared!   
   
**Mash:**   
The giant sequoias in the West are supposedly even larger.   
   
**Billy:**   
They're worth seeing once. If you're ever in Sierra Nevada, be sure not to miss them.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Wow. America's forests are amazing.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Yeah, these forests are still pristine.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
There are animals resembling gorillas, too.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Right. Those gorilla-like things...Um, where?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Over there. See. There's one waving at us. It's holding a glow stick, no doubt.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...That's not a gorilla, it's a werewolf-type enemy. And it's holding a club.   
   
**Mash:**   
P-P-Prepare for battle! It was clearly trying to ambush us!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh, it's just an enemy? That's too bad. Let's finish this up quickly!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I worked up a little sweat. My [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet], give me something to wipe the sweat off.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Here, use this...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hey, wait! It's not right to use my Noble Phantasm as a towel!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Master, don't get carried away and try to snatch anything from me either!   
   
## Section 9: A Star Is Born   
   
**Mash:**   
We have emerged from the forest. Robin, is that the town you told us about?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yeah, that's right.... Hmm? Somebody's here.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Yes, that's an ally.   
   
**Spy:**   
Geronimo. I have news.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Hmm...I see. I'm sorry, but please continue your investigation.   
   
**Billy:**   
Who were those guys?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
They've been tracking the Celtic soldiers for me. In particular, I want to know where they're coming from.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Once we get that Saber on our side,we can pursue the matter further.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Ugh, I don't want to do this...  
   
**G：???:**  
♪Hum, hum, hum, hum...Okay then, the groundwork is in place.   
   
**G：???:**  
It's a shame that a Western is the only thing you can shoot in a town like this&ndash;  
   
**G：???:**  
But not to worry. Even in a Western, my extraordinary acting talent will no doubt win me an Academy Award!   
   
**G：???:**  
I'll be concurrently responsible for production, direction, the script, music, and the leading role...  
   
**G：???:**  
Oh, no! I just realized there's no cameraman&ndash;!   
   
**G：???:**  
Hmph, what am I to do...Perhaps the time has finally come for me to try my hand at summoning?   
   
**G：???:**  
But my profound talent may result in summoning a big shot...I'll be forced to choose between Eastwood and Scott...  
   
**E：???:**  
Hmm. Hollywood, is it? One must not underestimate the creative minds of Servants.   
   
**G：???:**  
Hmph, who are you? I'm quite busy, so off with you...Unless you're a cameraman.   
   
**Fergus:**   
Do excuse me. My name is Fergus. I once earned my keep as a Knight of the Red Branch.   
   
**Fergus:**   
Normally, I would have happily called myself a cameraman in order to hit on you&ndash;but things are complicated now.   
   
**G：???:**  
Oh?   
   
**Fergus:**   
So I'm going to kill you. Period. If you want someone to resent, you have only me.   
   
**Fergus:**   
I'm doing this entirely for myself, after all. I'll cut you down just because I want to.   
   
**G：???:**  
Hmph. You seem to have your reasons, but I won't ask. You're quite bold to think you can kill me.   
   
**G：???:**  
I don't mean to boast, but I, Nero Claudius, am not a petty Servant who will die so easily, you see?   
   
**Fergus:**   
...Nero, the tyrant of ancient Rome! What an unusual Servant to run into.   
   
**Fergus:**   
No wonder your radiance is different from that mediocre rabble. Such a swelling. A swelling similar to a waterfall.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Mediocre...rabble?   
   
**Fergus:**   
Indeed. On my way here,I cut down three other Servants.   
   
**Fergus:**   
So you'll be my fourth victim.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Oh. Very impressive.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
But unfortunately, O mighty Fergus mac Róich, you're quite mistaken.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
The fourth victim...will be YOU!   
   
**Fergus:**   
&ndash;I see. So I guess you aren't just an emperor that orders people about from your throne.   
   
**Fergus:**   
How delightful. I guess there was no need to bring them...  
   
**Fergus:**   
Very well then. I'm Fergus, of the Saber class. I'll face you as one of the queen's knights.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
You know, what you're most mistaken about is your destiny. You are truly unlucky.   
   
**Fergus:**   
...What?   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
&ndash;You're here, right? Faceless King!   
   
**Fergus:**   
...Ugh!!   
   
**Fergus:**   
...Who's there?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yeah, yeah. I'll just come on out now.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hey there, little emperor. I'm impressed you knew I was here.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Call it my sixth sense. I'm quite attuned to the presence of spectators.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yup, yup. Nothing less from a tyrant always seeking love. Anyway, I'm not the only one who came running here.   
   
**Mash:**   
Nero!?   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Hmm, that voice...I feel like I have heard it somewhere before...  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, that's right...You were still alive, back in Rome.   
   
**Mash:**   
Ahem. Your Majesty, Nero Claudius. I am Mash Kyrielight.   
   
**Mash:**   
Please accept our humble assistance.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, we owe you for your help in Rome!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Grant us the glory of fighting by your side one more time!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Oh? So we have met somewhere before. You have earned my trust.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Anyway, both of you are my type! What beautiful faces!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
You may have the honor of standing beside me! Pleased to meet you, strangers from my past!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Hehe. Master. Nero is just the same, isn't she?   
   
**Fergus:**   
Hmm. I suppose it is reckless to take on so many.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
It would save us a lot of trouble if you would just surrender.   
   
**Fergus:**   
&ndash;Surely, you jest.   
   
**Fergus:**   
I also shall borrow the power of my queen! Come out, brave soldiers!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
!!!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Tch, so they were hiding.   
   
**Fergus:**   
One against seven is a bit tough, but a hundred against seven should be more even.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Oh great...Looks like I can't slack off here.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
I do not pardon laziness, mouse. If you wish to serve me, fight for your life.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Got it. Well then&ndash; Guess it's time to perform my role as an ally of justice!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Fergus:**   
Ugh!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That's checkmate, General Muscles.   
   
**Fergus:**   
General...Hah, general, you say? Sorry, but I'm no general.   
   
**Fergus:**   
My role is to simply add a little flair to the queen's legend.   
   
**Fergus:**   
I only wished to become her equal in the world this time...  
   
**Rama:**   
W-Wait, Fergus! Do you know of my bride, Sita?   
   
**Rama:**   
The wife of a man named Rama, by the name of Sita!   
   
**Fergus:**   
Your bride? I don't know if she was your bride, but I've seen a young woman of similar appearance to you.   
   
**Rama:**   
Where!?   
   
**Fergus:**   
...Hmph, very well. That was the one thing I found unpleasant in the queen's strategy, after all.   
   
**Fergus:**   
Return to the West, Rama. To Alcatraz Island. Your bride may be there.   
   
**Rama:**   
Did you say...Alcatraz Island?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, the famous prison island, said to be impossible to escape!?   
   
**Fergus:**   
It's your choice whether to trust me or not.   
   
**Rama:**   
No...I will. I'll believe you, Fergus mac Róich.   
   
**Rama:**   
I'll head to Alcatraz Island.   
   
**Fergus:**   
Heroes of India gaze at other people with such pure, beautiful eyes...  
   
**Fergus:**   
Still, good grief&ndash;  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Hm?   
   
**Mash:**   
???  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh?   
   
**Fergus:**   
There are so many splendid women here besides the queen.   
   
**Fergus:**   
What a waste, to die at a time like this...Ahahaha!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
...A Celtic warrior who can admire beauty? That man Fergus had such fine taste!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
No, I think it's just that he doesn't have any standards at all...  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Hm? Did you say something?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Oh, nothing. Anyway, what are you doing in an abandoned city like this, Your Majesty?   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
You can't tell? ...Well, I suppose I can't blame you.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hehehe, I know. I've got it! This is a plan only a woman with an appreciation for art and beauty could come up with!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
We meet again, Saber! It must be fate that we were both summoned to America.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I can hear Mount János whispering to settle things here. To see who has the greater talent!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Oh? ...I thought I sensed something tingling. It must have been you, the devilish singing diva, Elisabeth!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Hehehe. Things must be made clear to you, above all others. Listen well. In fact, everyone should listen...  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
To my grand plan which is as profound as the deepest abyss!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...I've already got an idea. Well, go right ahead, Your Majesty.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Very well, I shall! Here, I plan to build the city of ultimate fantasy, namely...  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Hollywood! That world-renowned palace of amusement!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Whaaaaaat!?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Whaaaaaat.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Yes, such a pleasant reaction, thank you! I see you're a top class Master!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Ugh...To think you've taken one of the two greatest locations in America...Though admittedly I've already taken the other one...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I knew it, Saber...You and I are tied by bonds of true friendship!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
We're rivals! And friends who appreciate the same art!   
   
**Mash:**   
...It's just like we expected, Senpai.   
   
**Billy:**   
Heroes are amusing, aren't they, Geronimo?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
I feel like I understand why the Roman Empire collapsed now.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Treating someone's aesthetic sense is outside of my field.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Do you intend to help me with my plan? I could even promote you to sub-heroine, Mash!   
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you very much. It's an honor to be the sub-heroine.   
   
**Mash:**   
...However, Nero. Or should I say, Your Majesty. There's just one problem with your plan.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Hm? What on earth could be the flaw in my perfect plan?   
   
**Mash:**   
This nation is currently in the middle of a war due to these Celtic warriors.   
   
**Mash:**   
As it is now, you won't find any cameramen&ndash;or even an audience!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
What!?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
(Yup. I know that all too well. I knew that all along! )  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
N-No wonder a single person hasn't appeared to listen to my rehearsals!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
There's a saying in the Orient: “Amusement is only amusing when you have a livelihood. ”  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
...Well, it might have been a little different...But close enough.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Very well! In that case, I must make a stand as well! To build a golden city of movies in this land!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Elisabeth, our showdown is on hold. For now, we need to mop up the Celtic warriors in this country!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Yes, I'd expect no less from my rival! I won't lose!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Leave the ticket sales to me! I'll force it on them after they're defeated!   
   
**Mash:**   
What a beautiful friendship.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yeah, beautiful...As long as we don't get wrapped up in it.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Anyway, this means Saber's our ally now. We even took down Fergus as a bonus.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Let's consider this to be a good omen.   
   
**Mash:**   
Excuse me, there's a transmission from the Doctor. Yes, Doctor?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry for interrupting your fun. If you head a little west from your location, you'll find a point with a strong Leyline.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'd like you to establish a circle and set up a summoning point as usual.   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. Everyone, I'm sorry, but there's a place we'd like to go.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
But the patient...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah, don't worry about that. Once the summoning point is established, we can supply healing spells.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Using that, you can hold out for a while. Securing camp is vital, for Rama's sake as well.   
   
## Section 10: Ambivalent States   
   
**Mash:**   
As usual, it seems enemies are gathering at the Leyline. Let's clean them up.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
I'll set up the summoning circle now.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yes, nice work as always. I'm glad you managed to establish the base safely.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Now then. I suppose today's story should be about the United States of America?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Although...I don't have much relation to that nation at all...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Besides, what kind of fool would put a code in their own self-portrait?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Do you know how it feels to have something like that pushed onto you? Do you?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Anyway, setting that aside...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The phrase “e pluribus unum” is their national motto, meaning “out of many, one. ”  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But that is the contradiction.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
To unite many into a single entity,the many must lose their individuality.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
They claim to be rationalism incarnate,yet act as champions of justice.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
They strive to be the strongest in the world, yet believe in a god.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The nation of America is the embodiment of contradictory tendencies in humans.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
&ndash;And for that reason, their nation has no connection whatsoever to monsters or Magecraft.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
While they may all reach for the same unattainable stars, their approaches are fundamentally different.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But having no connection doesn't mean one has no knowledge.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
A Holy Grail War may have occurred, even in this nation. But that would be in a different world, a faraway world&ndash;  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...That's about it for today's lesson, I think. The summoning circle is established, after all.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Anyway, ciao everyone♪Do your best as always!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Hm, night falls quickly. We should rest soon.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
It'd be one thing if we were all Servants, but we have a Master with us. Plus one of us is wounded.   
   
**Rama:**   
I'm fine! Oww...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
I fully understand your condition. Please stop trying to act tough.   
   
**Rama:**   
H-Hey! Stop trying to gouge my wounds! Fine, I got it. I want to rest, I really do!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hm, that's fine I suppose. Hey, Greenie, lend me that towel.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I told you, this isn't a towel! It's my Noble Phantasm! It's not something to sit your ass on!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Haah. You're so stingy. I can tell how you were raised, you know?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I don't need to be told by some exploitative aristocrat!   
   
**Billy:**   
There are silent ways to laugh!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
You're always laughing out loud, though. Geez...  
   
**Billy:**   
Night gets cold, so I'll gather firewood now. Sound okay?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Yes, we aren't within their sphere of influence yet. It would be a problem if Fujimaru freezes to death.   
   
**Billy:**   
Okay. Robin, help me out.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'll go sing for a bit. One needs to keep practicing, no matter the time.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's both the fate and duty of an idol. Also, a life of an idol. Oh, and hope of an idol.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Hmm, well said. I won't lose either!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
The necrosis in your heart is starting to spread faster. I can still keep you alive for a few days, but&ndash;  
   
**Nightingale:**   
After that, I can't make any promises.   
   
**Rama:**   
I understand. Just let me rest for now.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I'll inject a double dose of painkillers. That should help.   
   
**Rama:**   
No, I won't stay conscious without the pain. I need to be able to move, if the time comes...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Then I'll give you the normal dose. Just be prepared for intense pain.   
   
**Rama:**   
I know. This is a punishment that I must accept.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Punishment?   
   
**Rama:**   
I suffered an unsightly defeat to Cú Chulainn. Not only that, but to save me&ndash;  
   
**Rama:**   
Many people were sacrificed. Therefore, this is my punishment.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Are idiots allowed to become kings in India?   
   
**Rama:**   
What?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
In what world would people, after risking their lives to save someone, be happy to see that person suffer?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
The people who saved you surely wished for your safety, and for your good health.   
   
**Rama:**   
Uh...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
All too foolish. Recover from your wounds, and fight to honor those who saved you.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That is the best, and only, thing you can do for them.   
   
**Rama:**   
...Thanks for the advice.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That's a nurse's duty.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Ah, Master. The stars are beautiful, aren't they?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There's nothing there.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, a primal landscape. A place where it's hard for people to survive, where only beasts are allowed to live.   
   
**Mash:**   
How long do you need to devote to something for a nation to be born here&ndash;I can't even begin to imagine.   
   
**Mash:**   
Countless people, resources, blood and sweat. The culmination of humanity's efforts that transcends good and evil.   
   
**Mash:**   
...No matter how much I thought about it in Chaldea, I couldn't understand...But I'm starting to see now.   
   
**Mash:**   
It's all because of you. Thank you very much.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're welcome.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm nothing special.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**Mash:**   
What is it, Fou?   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Don't run, Fou! Just sit still, and let me brush you!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou fou!   
   
**Mash:**   
You're being threatened, Nero.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Hmph, too bad. By the way, Geronimo was calling for you.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
He wanted to talk about our plans going forward...Hm?   
   
**Mash:**   
Night is their time. Call for everyone. Let's fight back!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Geronimo:**   
We're currently in the western region of North America. The Celtic warriors seem to mainly be coming from the East.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
American army bases and cities have fallen one after another.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
While most of them massacre men and women of all ages, some Servants seem to allow non-combatants to escape.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
It's fine to be an honorable Servant, but those that escaped are going to die sooner or later regardless.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
The East is almost completely occupied. And...This is the most important part...  
   
**Geronimo:**   
They're using Washington as their base. In other words, the original capital.   
   
**Mash:**   
Are you sure of that?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
It's information from a man who escaped from Washington, but I have no proof.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Still, if you don't mind hearing my personal intuition, I believe this is the enemy's main stronghold.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Why is that?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
When seeking to humiliate a nation,the most effective method is to occupy their capital.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
On the other hand, the United Western States led by Edison has been actively accepting refugees from the East.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
He makes them work in mechanized infantry factories, and diligently makes improvements each day.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
He is accompanied by Helena Blavatsky, with whom he was also friends in life&ndash;  
   
**Geronimo:**   
As well as one of the most powerful beings in Indian mythology, the “Hero of Benefaction” Karna, from the Mahabharata.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Blavatsky may be obvious, but it's unknown why Karna would have taken his side...  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Regardless, those three and their mechanized infantry seem to be compensating for their lack of Servants.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Now, assuming that Washington is the enemy stronghold&ndash;the question is, what should we do next?   
   
**Billy:**   
I know! Can't we wait for them to destroy each other?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
That would be difficult.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Since the Celts possess the Grail, Edison's army can't close the military power gap regardless of the improvements he's made.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
If anything, it's the chaotic nature of the current situation that allows small forces like us to move around freely.   
   
**Billy:**   
That's true. Never mind!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Most of us rallying here on this occasion are heroes, but not really heroes.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
An outlaw, an outcast, a lone wolf.... That's the type of folk we are.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Given the chance, they will exploit that weakness of ours. So there's only one way to win.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
We must search for specific Servants, and eliminate them.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
As I thought, our only option is assassination. We'll infiltrate their base and take out the Servants.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Um...Is that really okay? There's more than one of them, right?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
You're correct, dragon girl.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
The capital has the toughest defense in a nation. It would be difficult for even an Assassin to infiltrate and assassinate someone.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Normally, at least.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Which means?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Celtic warriors are extremely belligerent.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Also, considering the haphazard nature of their invasions, it's obvious they simply do as they please.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
In other words&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
...The Celtic warriors won't place any emphasis on defending the capital?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
That's my speculation. They simply see a fortress as a place to live, and not a place to defend.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
They stress about how strong their warriors ought to be&mdash; Their society values individuals more than the whole.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Ah, I get it. Rather than build up a castle's defenses, they think they can rely on their own strength.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That's the opposite of Edison, who believes in uniformity and strength in numbers. No wonder their castle is shorthanded.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Yeah. However, this is a gamble.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
We have no way to defend the West. We must gamble since the difference in military strength is overwhelming.   
   
**Billy:**   
Hmm, I guess this really is the bottom of the barrel.   
   
**Billy:**   
I don't like it, but I doubt there's a better plan than this.   
   
**Billy:**   
I got no problem with this plan.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
No matter how slim it may be, I will take any chance I can get. An all-or-nothing gamble scares me.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Lancer and I don't mind, either.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Right. We're really busy, so the sooner it ends the better.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Medical treatment is pointless if it doesn't address the source. If Washington is the lesion, it must be cut out.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...However, we should prioritize treatment of this patient first.   
   
**Rama:**   
I'm fine...Or so I'd like to say, but I'm useless when it comes to assassination. I'll only slow you down.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Yes, exactly. That's why I want to split our force into two.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
One group will go with Nightingale in pursuit of the Servant Sita, who has ties to Rama, for his treatment.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
The other will infiltrate the East,and carry out the assassination.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...The assassination mission is dangerous, there's a high chance of failure. We must avoid clumping up and getting wiped out.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Personally, I'd like Mash and Fujimaru to accompany Nightingale and Rama.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
What do you think?   
   
**Mash:**   
Us?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Yes. To put it one way...You're our ace in the hole. Literally, our trump card.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
If all goes well and we eliminate the enemy, that's fine. If we can't, the rest is in your hands.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai? I'll leave the decision up to the Master.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Understood.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go with that.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Very well, I'll leave it to you. Now, in terms of balance...I'd like at least one more Servant to go along with you.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
...Hm, okay. Lancer...No, Elisabeth. You should go with them.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? Why me? We're not going together?   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Umu. While I'd love to see whose song is better...We can't exactly sing loudly during an assassination mission.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
That would be boring.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
That's why when we meet again, we'll make a big stage. They'll be the judges, and we'll finally settle things.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
To see who the true idol is!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Ugh...How splendid! A once-in-a-lifetime performance! I'd expect no less from my rival. You think BIG!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Judges?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Let's just pretend we didn't hear that.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
But in that case, shouldn't you go with the Master instead of me, Nero? Can you handle something as complicated as an assassination?   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Hehehe, sorry to disappoint you, but I'm more fitted for assassination.... Why, you ask?   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
I'm Nero Claudius. I'm a veteran of both assassinating and being assassinated!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Life as emperor is filled with conspiracies. Kill or be killed, poison or be poisoned. It's filled with gory details.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
...Umu. I feel sad just saying that...Either way, there's no one more suited for assassination than me!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Ahem...Go on, feel free to applaud. Applaud.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That's not something to brag about, Your Majesty.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
I know. Even I'm not even really trying to brag.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
But with my “Imperial Privilege,” I can mimic an Assassin for a while.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
There's also another very important reason.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Important...reason?   
   
**Mash:**   
What could that be...  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Umu. Well you see...Rama and I are way too similar!   
   
**Rama:**   
That's all!?   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
What do you mean, that's all? It's important not to have overlapping characteristics!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...In that case, we can't help it. That's a fatal issue for any group, after all...  
   
**Rama:**   
It's really that important? So much so that you accepted it instantly!?   
   
**Rama:**   
Hey, Fujimaru. I'm really confused here!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't worry about it.   
   
**Rama:**   
You say that, but...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Okay, settle down a bit, patient.   
   
**Rama:**   
Owwww!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Individuality is important.   
   
**Rama:**   
Fujimaru, you too? So characteristic overlap...is really that important...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Anyway, it's fine. You'd better get that assassination done, Nero.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
That goes without saying. Just leave it to me. It's like a secret live performance.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
That settles it, then. Myself, Robin, Billy, and Nero...  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Our team will head to the East for the assassinations. And&ndash;  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Nightingale, Rama, Mash, Elisabeth,and Master Fujimaru...  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Your team will head to Alcatraz Island to rescue Sita. Any issues with that, Master?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not at all.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Please be careful.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Of course. Very well, we'll depart tomorrow morning.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'll give you a communication device. We can use it to decide where to rendezvous afterwards.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Sure. Now rest up and prepare for tomorrow.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Particularly you, Master. You need to head back west. Make sure you eat something and sleep well tonight.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Geronimo:**   
We'll be heading to the East now.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, and we'll head to Alcatraz Island.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
I'm sure there are Celtic Servants posted at Alcatraz Island as well. Be careful.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. You too, Geronimo.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Master. Our time together was short, but enjoyable. I pray for success on your end.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You sound like you're going to die.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You sound like we won't meet again.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Hm, I suppose I do sound like that.... Don't worry, we'll meet again.   
   
**Billy:**   
Hey, Master. Don't worry, this will be quick.   
   
**Billy:**   
Just sit tight and wait for the good news! ...Just kidding.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Take care of the little princess here, Master.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hey, it should be the other way around! I'm going to take care of these guys.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yeah, yeah.... Anyway, time to get to work.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Umu. Fujimaru, watch over Lancer for me.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hey, you too, Saber? That's so rude.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Ahahahaha. Forgive me, Lancer.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Listen, Saber. This is a promise. When you come back, we'll settle who number one is&ndash;  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
I know. We'll have a showdown, fair and square,and see who's more worthy of the audience's applause!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
I'll show you my true strength when that time comes! &mdash;It's mind-blowing, by the way!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
So she's been holding back all this time? Now that's a scary thought.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Yes, go and kill them all, Saber. We still have that collaboration between Golden Theater and Castle Csejte to do.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Umu, leave everything to me!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Well, let's get moving.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Umu. It was a quick farewell, but I have no regrets. Now, to finish our tasks.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...We're not going to our deaths, Nero.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
I'm aware of that. But I also know how dangerous assassination plots can be.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
We're infiltrating deep into enemy lines. Prioritizing our own survival reduces the chance of success.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hey, are you planning to...  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Say nothing more. It would be insensitive of you, Archer...I mean, Robin Hood.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
I intend to survive. My stubbornness is second to none, after all!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That's true. I don't intend to die, either. Let's just do our best.   
   
**Billy:**   
Hey, Geronimo.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
What?   
   
**Billy:**   
I'm an American, so it's fine, but...You're a proud Apache, right?   
   
**Billy:**   
Is it really okay? Saving this nation, I mean.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
You're still saying that? If this nation isn't saved, we won't be saved, either.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Besides, the idea of America owing me a debt is pleasant.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Even if all is lost and forgotten once the world corrects itself.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
There's no need for you to feel any sort of guilt.   
   
**Billy:**   
...I see. Then I'll go with that.   
   
**Billy:**   
I just hope this assassination goes well.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Indeed...  
   
**Rama:**   
Ugh...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Master. It seems he's finally approaching his limit.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Please try to make haste. If not, I may be forced to amputate the patient's limbs...  
   
**Rama:**   
Anything but that. Haha, I need to show some willpower...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
This patient's display of toughness is praise-worthy. An ordinary person would have broken mentally already.   
   
**Rama:**   
I can't die until I meet my wife. That is my duty, as the king of Kosala.   
   
**Rama:**   
...At least, that's what I tried to do. But she ended up being harmed for that reason.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Right, according to the Ramayana, you suspected your wife of infidelity, and tested her twice.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Seriously? No wonder she got mad at you.   
   
**Rama:**   
...No, I never suspected my wife of infidelity. But that wasn't enough to appease the people.   
   
**Rama:**   
The first ceremony should have removed all doubt...But the people continued to suspect her.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...You trusted her, right?   
   
**Rama:**   
I did. However, I still exiled her. I had no choice.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What the...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Isn't that the same as suspecting her?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's right! You're the worst! Simply the worst!   
   
**Mash:**   
U-Um, both of you, calm down...He's injured.   
   
**Rama:**   
...No, they're right. I truly am the worst.   
   
**Rama:**   
Self-protection, embarrassment, fear...As one ages, various things intertwine, and tie you down.   
   
**Rama:**   
This truth is evident from my being summoned as a youth. Back during this time, all I felt for Sita was love.   
   
**Rama:**   
You could say that was my peak condition...Back when that was enough for me.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Then you must endure, until you meet your love once again. If you truly love her, you must prove it.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
If not, it would be the same as if you didn't love her. Some things must be said to truly be understood.   
   
**Rama:**   
I understand that. Now, let's hurry. I'm still fine.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
We should hurry, Master.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Right. At the very least, this lady Sita needs to give this man a good slap across the face.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
If it comes down to it, I could even lend her my microphone!   
   
**Rama:**   
Haha, that sounds painful.... Hm? Master, there seems to be enemies about.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's right. I've detected enemies. They're Celt warriors, but their numbers are few.   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. Let's go, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Now, let's hurry onwards. No stops until Alcatraz.   
   
## Section 11: The Rock   
   
**Mash:**   
We've arrived. That island over there is Alcatraz Island.   
   
**Rama:**   
It's unexpectedly close. But we still can't exactly swim there.   
   
**Mash:**   
The chance of being noticed by enemy Servants&mdash;  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
The island's not that big...Anybody could notice us when we land. No use worrying about that.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
More importantly, I don't want to swim. Got that?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can't swim?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sink like a rock?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's not it! I've...never properly swam before, but I'm sure I'd be fine!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What I'm trying to say is,I don't want to swim in the ocean.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Seawater dries out my skin.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It might be fine for the Servants, but I'm sure it would be hard for our Master Fujimaru.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Currents are swift, and the water is cold. It's an extremely unfit place to swim.   
   
**Mash:**   
We'll try searching for a boat that'll get us across.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Maybe we should ask the old man over there.... Um, excuse me?   
   
**Old Man:**   
Hm?   
   
**Mash:**   
We're looking for a boat to cross over to that island&ndash;  
   
**Old Man:**   
...Forget it. There are demons living on that island now.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Demons?   
   
**Old Man:**   
That's right. I know because I'm originally from England. Those were “dragonkin. ”  
   
**Mash:**   
What!?   
   
**Old Man:**   
If you really want to go, I can lend you my boat...But you'd better pay for it if you break it.   
   
**Mash:**   
...There you have it.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Dragonkin, huh? That's not too bad, I'm a Dragonkin too. Well, a Demi at that.   
   
**Rama:**   
Wait...You are!?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Where did you think my tail and horns came from?   
   
**Rama:**   
That's...I thought you were just into things like that...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
When you've healed, Sita won't be the only one slapping you!   
   
**Mash:**   
Th-That's enough.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Dragons waiting at our destination or not, this patient is at his limit.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
We shouldn't be afraid of a fight. We need to go, there's no time to waste.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Right, it'll be fine. We fought more than enough dragonkin in France, after all.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
There were wyverns everywhere we looked...As a fellow Demi-Dragon, it got old really fast.   
   
**Rama:**   
I see. The journey to save the world sounds like quite the ordeal.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;Anyway, Master.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Set sail!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**E：???:**  
...Hm. One, two, three, four...But one of them seems weakened...Is that one injured?   
   
**E：???:**  
So that really means three. Seriously? ONLY three?   
   
**E：???:**  
I just hope there's enough for everyone to get their fill...  
   
**E：???:**  
Tch...Whatever. All right. Guys, you've got work.   
   
**E：???:**  
You're not just here to live idly and eat humans. Go put yourselves to the test!   
   
**G：???:**  
......  
   
**G：???:**  
&mdash;Lord Rama?   
   
**Mash:**   
We're here.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I've already picked up several enemy wyvern responses. Also&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
A Servant is here.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Right. But the Servant doesn't seem to be moving.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The wyverns seem to be deployed to form a path to the enemy Servant.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Which means?   
   
**Rama:**   
...We're likely being tested. He's saying, “I'm right here. Come at me...”  
   
**Nightingale:**   
And if we don't defeat that Servant, we likely won't be able to meet Sita.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Let's head straight there. Considering the patient's condition, we don't have a moment to lose.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
No need to wait for permission to operate. Cutting straight through!   
   
**Mash:**   
Uh, w-wait! ...Then again, I guess Nightingale isn't exactly the type of person to wait...  
   
**Mash:**   
Let's follow her. There's no mistake that her choice is the fastest option. No sense in overthinking.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's right. It's good when things are easy to understand. Let's charge, full speed ahead!   
   
**Mash:**   
Here they come. Wyverns and Celtic warriors! Master, please give me your orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Whew, piece of cake! Are you still doing okay?   
   
**Rama:**   
...Yes, somewhat. Right now, I'm just worried whether I'll be able to meet Sita again or not.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh? We're busy fighting for our lives,and you're thinking about your wife?   
   
**Rama:**   
I-I can't fight like this, I can't help it! I'd love to fight if I could!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
No, I meant the opposite. That's a good thing. I thought you were some playboy prince, but you're actually really nice.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Okay, I feel more motivated! Leave these weaklings to me. I'll make sure you see your wife again!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
But in exchange, you'd better apologize to her properly. Every girl wants to know that someone needs them.   
   
**Rama:**   
Y-Yes...That's right. I just hope I have the chance to apologize...  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Nightingale:**   
We must push forward and defeat them, for his treatment!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Ugh...  
   
**Mash:**   
Are you okay!?   
   
**Rama:**   
Don't hurt yourself too much for me, Nightingale. I know of shame, and you mentioned something similar earlier.   
   
**Rama:**   
I don't wish for you to be harmed.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Be quiet. For me, the second most hated thing in this world is an incurable illness.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
What I hate most are patients who don't try to recover.   
   
**Rama:**   
S-Shouldn't it be the opposite?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
No. Incurable diseases will become curable someday.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Doctors and nurses like myself constantly work towards that goal, racking our minds and building knowledge.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
We must cure illness, even if that means killing people. Disease must be killed, massacred, and exterminated.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;But to do that, a patient's willpower is imperative.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Curing a patient who has no will to recover is impossible, for any doctor.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Medical treatment can only begin when someone has the will to be healed.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I intend to cure you. I'll cure you so you can act openheartedly.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I'll cure you so that you may whisper words of love to your wife. I'll cure you&mdash;so you can wield your sword and fight.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
But for that, your body, your cells,must have the determination to recover.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
If you lose willpower, muster it up again. Otherwise, I'll kill you myself.   
   
**Rama:**   
...You know, you really are a Berserker!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You disapprove?   
   
**Rama:**   
Not at all...I got it. I'll recover. I WILL recover. I have the desire to do so.   
   
**Rama:**   
I refuse to die, not until my wish is fulfilled!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
This is the final gate. Please hold out just a little longer.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...A Servant!   
   
**E：???:**  
Hey. Welcome to the Alcatraz Penitentiary. Are you here for imprisonment? An attack? Aiding a jailbreak?   
   
**E：???:**  
Let me know what you want. I'll think about it after I kill you.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
This patient's wife seems to be held here. She's necessary for his recovery, please release her.   
   
**E：???:**  
What, you're here for a meeting? Seriously, you didn't come to fight?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Of course not. Why would a nurse want to fight? The only things that nurses fight are illness and injury.   
   
**E：???:**  
You're absolutely correct. A nurse who takes lives would be out of their mind.   
   
**E：???:**  
Hmm? That means you're actually not crazy? You're quite the respectable Servant!   
   
**Rama:**   
I must agree with our enemy.   
   
**Rama:**   
This nurse here is a contradictory woman,someone who's crazy yet isn't crazy either.   
   
**E：???:**  
Oh? I thought you were just their luggage, but you can talk? I get it. You're that lady's husband.   
   
**E：???:**  
Unfortunately for you,I have no intention of letting her go.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;So you are obstructing treatment of an injured man. Obstacles must be eliminated.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I wish for bloodshed. No, I thirst for it.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
If it means saving a patient,I'll remove all obstacles down to their roots!   
   
**E：???:**  
Heh...Hahahaha! How amusing! So Berserkers come in different varieties too!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Ugh...This Servant doesn't make me feel well...I feel it in my horns!   
   
**E：???:**  
I'm sure, young lady! After all, my True Name is Beowulf&ndash;the “Dragon Slayer. ”  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The famed hero of the oldest English epic poem, Beowulf!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He's a formidable enemy, so don't hold back. Everyone, fight him together!   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Oh, we're starting with a group fight? I see you guys are going all out, I like that!   
   
**Mash:**   
Wha...A dragonkin? It wasn't just wyverns?   
   
**Beowulf:**   
I handpicked this one. A bit of a waste to use in skirmishes, but good enough as a test.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
It's obvious that we're enemies,but there are still codes of conduct to follow.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
I admire those who are strong, even enemies. Fear not death, but extravagance, and never forget honor.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
That's the rule of our world. Well, it just means you need to fight, and prove yourself.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
This world is filled with conflict, and this nation is being swallowed into the mud of war.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
If you have a problem with that, come and fight. Prove that your life is worth living. Prove that you're warriors.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
If you manage that, let's see...I'll at least remember your names!   
   
**Beowulf:**   
What's going on? You don't feel pain, woman? Or, do you have a heart of iron?   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Edison's mechanized soldier is more human than you. You're like steel in human clothes, Berserker!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I'm often told that. I don't care at all. My body is simply a means to heal patients, after all.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
You're like a puppet just doing what it was built for! Looks like I need to crush you completely to stop you!   
   
**Rama:**   
...Wait. Nightingale, I have a request.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;You're a patient, please be quiet.   
   
**Rama:**   
No, this is necessary for my treatment.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...What is it?   
   
**Rama:**   
Put me down.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...I can't do that.   
   
**Rama:**   
Put me down, for the sake of treatment. If you fall, who will treat me?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&mdash;Can you even fight?   
   
**Rama:**   
Believe in me. A patient and doctor must first trust each other, right?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Just one correction. I'm a nurse, not a doctor.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Huh?   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Hey, I want to fight that living iron puppet lady over there.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
I have no interest in fighting a living corpse. Just go die in a corner or something.   
   
**Rama:**   
...You're right. I'm just a living corpse. However...Listen to me.   
   
**Rama:**   
I have quite the story for you. A sweet deal. You won't lose out.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Hm? You've come to a prison, and you got a sweet deal? You trying to bribe the jailer or something&mdash;  
   
**Rama:**   
&mdash;“Brahmastra! ”  
   
**Beowulf:**   
What!?   
   
**Beowulf:**   
You've got a pretty face, but you pull a surprise attack like that? Damn, now that's interesting!   
   
**Rama:**   
Shut up! Stand aside! For getting in the way of love, you could've got it much worse!   
   
**Rama:**   
My wife is waiting for me! I'm not going to be picky about my methods!   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Heh...Haha, of course! That's definitely my bad!   
   
**Beowulf:**   
I tried acting like a big villain, but that was more like some petty underling!   
   
**Beowulf:**   
All right, bring it on, frail boy! If you manage to beat me now, that's a victory for justice!   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Put your life on the line for your woman, and die with honor!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Beowulf:**   
&mdash;Tch, I can't even win against a man who's half-dead...I've lost, no matter how anyone looks at it.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Fine, I surrender. Do whatever you want. I'm not so tasteless as to stand in the way of your love.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Damn, bringing love affairs onto the battlefield...I'm weak against things like that.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
To be honest, I wanted to wipe you guys out, or be completely wiped out myself...  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Oh, by the way, I didn't lay a finger on the prisoner. She's so dainty, I felt like she'd snap just by touching her.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That means...you're surrendering from battle?   
   
**Beowulf:**   
That's right. We can talk somewhere else. Just get going, frail boy. Your dainty wife is waiting.   
   
**Rama:**   
Yes...I'll do that!   
   
**F：???:**  
......Lord Rama?   
   
**Rama:**   
Is that you, Sita? I've come for you...I've...come...  
   
**F：???:**  
Lord Rama!   
   
**Mash:**   
Rama, you shouldn't run in your condition...  
   
**Rama:**   
...Ah, damn it. My vision's all blurry. I can't see a thing.   
   
**Sita:**   
I'm right here, Lord Rama.   
   
**Rama:**   
Where...Sita...Where are you?   
   
**Rama:**   
...I wanted to see you. I wanted to see you. I really, really wanted to see you again.   
   
**Rama:**   
You being there for me was all I needed!   
   
**Mash:**   
Rama!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;We must begin treatment at once.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I'm sorry, normally we wouldn't conduct medical procedures in such an unsanitary place.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
But you're a Servant, so this is an exception. Feel free to hold his hand, no need for hesitation.   
   
**Sita:**   
...What happened to Lord Rama?   
   
**Mash:**   
I'll explain. You see&ndash;  
   
**Sita:**   
My, something like that happened? To think I could ever be of use to Lord Rama...  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, so who exactly are you?   
   
**Sita:**   
I am “Rama. ”  
   
**Mash:**   
What...What do you mean?   
   
**Sita:**   
Are you familiar with the curse placed on Lord Rama?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If I recall...When he killed the monkey Vali with an ambush from behind, the monkey's wife cast a curse on him.   
   
**Sita:**   
Yes. That curse keeps us apart, even as Heroic Spirits.   
   
**Sita:**   
We can never meet again.   
   
**Sita:**   
When participating in a Holy Grail War as Servants,either he or I get summoned as Rama.   
   
**Sita:**   
We are never summoned simultaneously. Even in Holy Grail Wars, we are fated to never meet again.   
   
**Sita:**   
...Even this unique situation is no different. When he awakens, I will most likely vanish.   
   
**Mash:**   
That can't be...  
   
**Sita:**   
&ndash;But it's okay. I'm fine with that. While Lord Rama wasn't able to see me...  
   
**Sita:**   
I was able to be here, and hold his hand. That's...enough for me to be happy.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
&ndash;Are you really okay with that? What about a heartfelt apology? An oath of love, from the bottom of his soul?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You don't want something like that? This man betrayed you once before, right?   
   
**Sita:**   
This man fought for 14 years, for my sake.   
   
**Sita:**   
He faced Ravana, even though we had only lived together for a year.   
   
**Sita:**   
He could have forgotten about me, and taken a new wife&ndash;but he never did, to the day he died.   
   
**Sita:**   
That's enough. I know his love and passion well enough. That's why we will...continue yearning for each other.   
   
**Sita:**   
Even if it's an impossible wish, we'll continue to believe that it'll come true one day.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...I see. It sounds like you had a short, but happy time together.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
The mending is mostly complete,but “something” is nestled inside, interfering.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's likely the curse of Gáe Bolg.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Even if he recovers from his wound, I doubt he will be able to fight...I am sorry to say.   
   
**Sita:**   
In that case, I shall offer this body.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
What!?   
   
**Sita:**   
I'll dispel the curse with my body. I'll burden myself with the curse, then disappear.   
   
**Sita:**   
Luckily, Rama and I are “one and the same. ” It should be simple to take the curse in his place.   
   
**Mash:**   
P-Please wait! That defeats the purpose of us coming here!   
   
**Mash:**   
Rama was able to come this far...because it was all for you!   
   
**Sita:**   
...Yes. I'm saying, those feelings...are enough to fulfill me.   
   
**Sita:**   
Also, from what you just told me, you need a strong warrior more than anything now. Isn't that right?   
   
**Sita:**   
In that case, my husband...Lord Rama, is the most powerful warrior in this world.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Very well, I'll transplant the lesion to you. Are you sure this is okay?   
   
**Sita:**   
Yes, please do so.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;I never married in my lifetime. However, I still understand your feelings of wanting to help another.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Though only a short while, it was an honor to speak with you. Farewell, Mrs. Sita.   
   
**Sita:**   
Yes.   
   
**Sita:**   
Lord Rama...Rama. I can take just a small portion of your burden.   
   
**Sita:**   
...I can aid your fight, even if it's only for a little. But that's more than enough to make me happy.   
   
**Sita:**   
I love you...I really, really do love you.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;Mr. Rama. Mr. Rama! Can you hear my voice? Should I fire a gun next to your ear?   
   
**Mash:**   
Please don't do that...  
   
**Rama:**   
......  
   
**Rama:**   
......Ah, she is gone.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;Yes, to cure you.   
   
**Rama:**   
I see...I thought she might do that, considering how abnormal this Holy Grail War is.   
   
**Rama:**   
So this is also destiny, I suppose.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
She held your hand, and kissed you. She offered you her tears, and her love.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That's why you're standing here, alive.   
   
**Rama:**   
&ndash;Thank you, Nightingale. Those words alone give me salvation.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
There's no need for a thank you. This is what gives my life meaning, after all.   
   
**Rama:**   
Nightingale, Mash, Elisabeth, Dr. Roman...and Master.   
   
**Rama:**   
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. I, Rama, Saber class and king of Kosala...  
   
**Rama:**   
...hereby renew my oath. Fujimaru, I am your Servant.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ready to fight?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Rama:**   
...My body does not falter. I'm fully prepared for battle.   
   
**Rama:**   
And...this time, I shall emerge victorious over Cú Chulainn. I swear it. I shall not be defeated again.   
   
**Mash:**   
...This completes our team's mission. We should hurry to the East.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
It's finally time to begin treating the root cause. Let's put our skills to the test.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hey, what exactly is the treatment?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
We shall purge the Celtic warriors. Completely.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Wonderful. Truly the most exciting treatment.   
   
## Section 12: Sympathy for the Soldier   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...How'd it go?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I'm done scouting. Geez. I'm really overusing “No Face May King. ”  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
We can't help it. If I went scouting, it would cause a huge uproar.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I guess that's true! But anyway...  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
It seems like they intend to hold a large-scale parade along this major street.   
   
**Billy:**   
A parade? Why would they do that?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That I don't know.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Still, that's definitely what those Celts are preparing.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
A parade...How outrageous! No, enviable!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Isn't that the opposite!?   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Archer. What a sad man...Have you never held a parade?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Why would I? I'm just a regular guy.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Parades are great...All the people shouting my name, the orderly troops marching along in perfect step.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
One wave of the hand, and I'm showered with “Wonderful! ” “Superb! ” “Hurray! ” “Lady Nero, sleep with me! ”  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Umu, now I want to hold a parade, too.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...I see. That sounds like an exciting time for anyone. Let's take out the target at the parade.   
   
**Billy:**   
Target who, exactly?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
The Servant with the highest honors held at the parade...Although it might not be a Servant.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Billy. At a parade, the person of highest influence must also stand out the most.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
That's the whole point of the event. But that also makes it a good opportunity for assassination.   
   
**Billy:**   
Hmm, it's not easy being a show-off.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Robin, did you notice any Servants lurking about?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I sensed two. If there were any others, they weren't within my detection range.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
The two there are surrounded by Celtic warriors.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
So most of the Servants are absent...  
   
**Billy:**   
But we don't know for sure. They could have just been outside of Robin's range.   
   
**Billy:**   
There's always the possibility of an ambush.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I'm an Archer. My Servant detection range is pretty far, you know?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Then again, Servants can indeed close in from outside detection range in an instant...  
   
**Billy:**   
&ndash;What should we do, Geronimo?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...We have to do it. This is undoubtedly a golden opportunity.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
We didn't have to fight on the way here at all. Meanwhile, Mash and company made a bold move out in the West.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
I'm sure the enemy is already aware of our actions.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
They might feel that something is up, but they surely don't think we have this many Servants lined up.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Yes. So what should we do?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Nero, what kind of Noble Phantasm do you have?   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Hm? My Noble Phantasm? My Noble Phantasm is&mdash;  
   
**Geronimo:**   
I see. Then we'll use that. There's no need to hold back on using Noble Phantasms. We'll end things here.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Umu! This is a great stage for our big moment!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Understood. Let's end this quickly, and make our escape.   
   
**Billy:**   
Yeah, let's do our best!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
&ndash;Then let's follow the plan.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I'll use “No Face May King” to disappear and get close...Make way for the Faceless King!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
That woman's standing above the Celtic warriors&ndash; I see, she's the queen!   
   
**Medb:**   
Everyone! Thank you so much for coming here to see me, Medb!   
   
**Medb:**   
This nation belongs to the Eternal King!   
   
**Medb:**   
A nation of Cú and myself, made by Cú and myself, for Cú and myself!   
   
**Medb:**   
Be honored that you serve us 24 hours a day. Rejoice that you are our subordinates 24 hours a day.   
   
**Medb:**   
Justice, honor, and glory all belong to us!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
&ndash;Robin!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Got it. Removing “No Face May King”!  Go, Saber!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Yes, leave it to me!   
   
**Medb:**   
Hm?   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Queen Medb! You may look cute, but your reign comes to an end now!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Sunlight of spring, dancing flowers! The winds of May that brush your cheeks! The blessed bells that ring all the way beyond stella!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Open, Nuptiae Domus Aurea!   
   
**Medb:**   
Could this be...a Reality Marble!? No, this is different. This is Magecraft! Unwavering, unhesitant Magecraft!   
   
**Medb:**   
It's so beautiful! I want this Noble Phantasm!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
This Noble Phantasm is beyond you, but we have a great banquet for you tonight! Brace yourself!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Queen of Connacht, Medb! Sorry, but we'll be taking your head!   
   
**Billy:**   
&ndash;Here goes!   
   
**Medb:**   
Oh my, so many! And because of this barrier, my warriors are weakened, too!   
   
**Medb:**   
This is bad! I'm in big trouble! Big, big trouble!   
   
**Medb:**   
Save me, my king!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Bring on your so-called king!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
This is the moment of truth. Put some spirit into this!   
   
**Billy:**   
Wait. I've got a bad feeling!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;Haaaaah!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Ugh...He has this much strength inside my Golden Theater!?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
A bold plan, but a failure. You should have targeted me, not Medb.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Child of Light, Cú Chulainn! Still in that ominous form, I see.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
It seems you're the holder of the Holy Grail!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Huh? I don't care about the Grail. I gave that thing to Medb.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Then what's this strength!? You're within Nero's Bounded Field!   
   
**Medb:**   
I wished for it!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
What!?   
   
**Medb:**   
I wished for Cú to “become a king”! A strong and wicked king, who could stand equal to me!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
&ndash;I see. If it's a wish upon the Grail, it's no wonder he can surpass this Bounded Field...  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
That doesn't matter. All I sought was this situation. I decided to reign supreme as “king,” and fight with all my might.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
...Oh? So you're a “king”? Let me ask you as an emperor. How do you intend to take the right of leadership?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I'll fight, kill, and conquer. That's all.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
...Is that really all?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I'm not the type to rule through wisdom. Besides, everyone living on this land is a warrior.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I'll take everything, kill everyone, and dominate everywhere...Then, when there's nothing left&ndash; I will return to the void.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
What...In that case, you're no different from a mindless beast!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
And what's wrong with that? We were born into an era that's neither dream nor reality.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
If everything's an illusion to begin with, we should all vanish without building anything, no?   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
So you would deny prosperity...You are not fit to be a king!   
   
**Medb:**   
Oh, but he is.   
   
**Medb:**   
The qualification to be king is absolute strength. Enough to declare domination and create a nation alone.   
   
**Medb:**   
That alone is enough for people to follow. Everything else can be handled by others.   
   
**Medb:**   
I mean, mankind is enslaved by strength. The weak will cling to the strong as long as they get to pick up the leftover glory.   
   
**Medb:**   
That's just the way of the world. Aren't you the same?   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Hah. I like lions, but mad dogs aren't my cup of tea. When it comes down to it, you're just another dog, a bitch, who seduced a lion.   
   
**Medb:**   
That's fine. I don't mind being a bitch. I don't mind at all.   
   
**Medb:**   
I mean, I fell in love. What am I supposed to do? That's right...Ever since the day I failed to take Ulster!   
   
**Medb:**   
A warrior who wouldn't become mine,a man who didn't heed to my will.   
   
**Medb:**   
A great hero who protected his nation alone,who boasted to none, and ended his life with a smile!   
   
**Medb:**   
As far as I know, Cú Chulainn is stronger than anyone or anything, and I've always loved him!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
I see. Then watch as the man you love falls!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Here I go!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
We're right behind you!   
   
**Billy:**   
Got it! ...Wait, are you kidding me?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
A Servant...  
   
**Medb:**   
&ndash;To be perfectly honest, I thought Cú would be more than enough here.   
   
**Medb:**   
But I figured I'd have one more as backup, just in case. I'm so smart!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...  
   
**Medb:**   
Oh dear. Don't look at me like that, Cú. This doesn't mean that I don't trust you, okay?   
   
**Medb:**   
But sometimes there's strength in numbers, you know? Like right now.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...I'll handle that woman. Take care of the other weaklings.   
   
**Medb:**   
Excited?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
No. This is a matter of principle. If she calls herself an emperor, then it's my duty as a king to crush her.   
   
**Medb:**   
Okay♪ Then go right ahead and handle the others, Arjuna!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Did she say...Arjuna!?   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
What!?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Arjuna, the eternal archenemy of Karna?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
This is the worst...To think that they have something like that hidden up their sleeve! I underestimated them!   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...I have no intention of making you suffer. Please let me finish my duty quickly.   
   
**Billy:**   
What should we do, Geronimo?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
&ndash;Robin!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
What!?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Take the communicator.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Use “No Face May King” and get out of here. We'll buy you some time.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
!!!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
What are you doing, Archer!? Go!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Unfortunately, I can't leave this place. I cannot afford to leave!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
I need to teach this man a thing or two about how to conduct oneself as a king!   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
&ndash;Listen well. You must live, and meet up with Fujimaru. We haven't been defeated yet.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Just go! Then return to this land with the song of victory!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...That's a tough order, but I got it. I'll be getting out of here first, Your Majesty.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Yes, that's more like it, Hunter of the Forest. I'm counting on you.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Now then&mdash; Sorry to keep you waiting, Cú Chulainn.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
So, thorny man. I think you're overdoing it a bit with that imposing look.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
You're right, but give me a break. This is me holding it back as much as I can.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Got that, girl? If you intend to win,you've got to settle things before it bursts open.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Now, why don't you show me how a king is supposed to act?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I have no intention of learning, though. Stuff like that isn't tasty.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Umu. It's not tasty, but it's meaningful. King of Beasts, I'll beat some humanity into you!   
   
**Mash:**   
There seem to be some survivors left. We should eliminate them as soon as possible.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Right. Once we're done with this assassination,I need to have that singing match with Saber, after all.   
   
**Rama:**   
I-I see...I hope that works out for you...  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Now, let's leave this island.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait! Enemy signals detected&ndash;Servants closing in!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
These are...the first enemy Servants you met!   
   
**Mash:**   
The first enemy Servants...Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne!   
   
**Fionn:**   
Hey there, Lady Mash. Do you remember my promise from before?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh, that...  
   
**Fionn:**   
Yes, I'm serious this time. That is, if you manage to survive your defeat!   
   
**Fionn:**   
You'll be mine. In other words, I want you as my bride.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
A proposal? That was a marriage proposal just now! Mash, you're unexpectedly popular!   
   
**Mash:**   
No. I already declined...Or rather, considering the situation, it's out of the question...  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Now, don't say that. We've been moved by your tremendous courage, Lady Mash.   
   
**Fionn:**   
Hm, Diarmuid can't stand women, and even he's interested! Hehehe, are you sweeping her off her feet right before my eyes again?   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
I-I wouldn't do something like that...I'm not even thinking about it!   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
I just, I simply admire Lady Mash for her unwavering courage, that's all...  
   
**Fionn:**   
Hahaha, I'm joking. I took it too far. Don't worry about it.   
   
**Fionn:**   
I should be the one begging for forgiveness, after all. Yes, I really can't do anything about this personality of mine.   
   
**Fionn:**   
However, that's enough. I'll stop joking around. I'll let go of all the grudges I had in life. That's because&mdash;  
   
**Fionn:**   
Young warrior, we are here to fight side by side. There is no greater joy than that on this earth.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
!!! Of course. That's most certain, my king!   
   
**Fionn:**   
&ndash;We can make up for their numbers with our own. Beowulf, what say you?   
   
**Beowulf:**   
...Huh? I don't feel like it. I'm going back east.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Besides, I didn't take on this job because I wanted to.   
   
**Fionn:**   
I see. Do as you please. Very well...We'll fight this one by ourselves.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Here they come! A large army of Celtic warriors!   
   
**Fionn:**   
Well, didn't you resurrect a mighty Servant who could stand up to this army?   
   
**Rama:**   
...That's right! Master, there's no need to worry.   
   
**Rama:**   
My Noble Phantasm is a divine blade, bestowed by Brahma. Sheer numbers are no match for me!   
   
**Rama:**   
Not to mention, I am now one with Sita!   
   
**Rama:**   
If you seek to defeat me, bring a million soldiers and their leader with ten heads and twenty arms to face me!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Rama:**   
This is nothing!! Hahaha! I feel great today, I could face another 10,000 opponents!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Wow, you're doing really well there, prince. I won't lose either!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Get to work, ghosts of Csejte. Now, I'll charm you with this hit song of mine!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Wait, wait, wait! You're a Servant, but you're also a nurse, right?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Yes, I'm a nurse. That's why I intend to kill you.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
That's some strange reasoning! Tch...That didn't work!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
How is it strange? You're like patients, delirious with a fever.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
If I don't cure it, you won't be saved! That's why I intend to save you, even if I have to kill you!   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Mm...Your reasoning is absurd, but your beliefs are real. I take back what I said earlier.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Your attempts to save others are noble. But I still serve my king.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
As long as I am alive, I will die for his life! Bring it!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
As long as you are alive...Is that so? Well then, allow me to relieve you of your royal duties!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
We have you now,Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne!   
   
**Fionn:**   
Very well. It's finally time to settle this! Will we get married or not? Let's begin the fight!   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
My King, please don't let your guard down on account of your bride's beauty. She is already a powerful foe. Please give up this talk of marriage.   
   
**Fionn:**   
Hahahaha! A shame, but of course, Diarmuid! Did you think we could defeat them whilst holding back?   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
No, not at all.   
   
**Fionn:**   
Right? Heh heh, as long as we're Servants...we can't escape from this desire.   
   
**Fionn:**   
To battle the strong. To carve away at life and soul.   
   
**Fionn:**   
That's why the Holy Grail War continues! ...Thinking of it that way, our king is quite an exception.   
   
**Fionn:**   
He's no doubt the most powerful warrior, so I can't believe he doesn't feel any joy!   
   
**Mash:**   
...He feels no joy?   
   
**Fionn:**   
Heh. Go meet him if you want to know more. Although he shows no mercy to his enemies!   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
That's enough idle chat.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
I am Diarmuid Ua Duibhne&ndash;the first spear of the Knights of Fianna! Here I come!   
   
**Fionn:**   
Yes, agreed! I am Fionn mac Cumhaill, captain of the Knights of Fianna! To battle!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Fionn:**   
Ugh...  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
My king! ...Guh, I can't go on...  
   
**Fionn:**   
Haha...Well, it can't be helped. I fought plenty, I've had my fill.   
   
**Fionn:**   
Diarmuid, I'm quite satisfied. But are you still not content?   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
...Yes. I thought victory would be ours this time.   
   
**Fionn:**   
&ndash;Well, to be honest. I didn't care if we won or lost this time.   
   
**Fionn:**   
When I was alive, I became more and more tainted.   
   
**Fionn:**   
The glimmer in my eyes wallowed within politics. The treasure, power, and duty I won tied me down more and more.   
   
**Fionn:**   
It was painful. So painful, yet I couldn't let it go.   
   
**Fionn:**   
&ndash;I fear that's why I envied you so much,as you were trying to die for your love.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
My king...You...  
   
**Fionn:**   
We fought together. In a pure yet avaricious pursuit of victory.   
   
**Fionn:**   
I'm satisfied...Although to be honest, it's regrettable that I couldn't take Lady Mash as my own...  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm very sorry. I can't accept your request.   
   
**Fionn:**   
Yes, I've been rejected! Now I shall pass on...Without regretfully clinging onto this world.   
   
**Fionn:**   
Would you accompany me, Diarmuid?   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Yes, sir!   
   
**Fionn:**   
As for you, Berserker. Do you not seek to heal your own wounds?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That's not necessary. I have neither the time nor the means to heal myself.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
My heart is torn to pieces by the simple existence of patients, after all.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That's why...If I was to be healed, it would be when there are no more patients in the world.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Until then, I will bear any wound as compensation.   
   
**Fionn:**   
I see. You are broken, yet beautiful. Your conviction is like a dazzling jewel.   
   
**Fionn:**   
Next time I'm summoned, I'd like to aid your cause. What do you think, making passes at my next bridal candidate?   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
What is there to say? It's very like you to do so, my king.   
   
**Fionn:**   
Yes, very well! It was worthwhile being summoned,if only because I was able to live youthfully until death!   
   
**Fionn:**   
Farewell, defenders of order! Let us meet again, if fate allows!   
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;Confirmed elimination of Spirit Origins.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Light and cheerful to the very end...Quite the pleasant pair.   
   
**Rama:**   
But considering how they gathered such a large force here, the assassination by the others must have gone well...Right?   
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;We've received a transmission. Huh? It's not Geronimo, but Robin Hood?   
   
**Mash:**   
I'll switch to open transmission.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
&ndash;Sorry. We screwed up.   
   
**Mash:**   
!!! Tell us what happened, Robin!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Old Man Geronimo, Billy, and Saber...Nero. They're probably all gone.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
&mdash;What? Hey, what are you talking about?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I'm heading to an abandoned Western United States base. Do you know the coordinates? I might need you to come right away.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Understood.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What happened?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
   
**Mash:**   
...I don't know. Doctor, do you know the location Robin specified?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Y-Yeah. Of course. Obtaining communicator coordinates&ndash;code received.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'll send you the shortest route to the destination. Head over there right away.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...You're kidding. That was a lie, right? He was just joking with us, right?   
   
## Section 13: Over the Rainbow   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Oh spirits that walk this earth. By the True Name of ■■■■■, lend me your power.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Unleashing Noble Phantasm&ndash; “Tsago Degi Naleya! ”  
   
**Arjuna:**   
&ndash;Howl. “Agni Gandiva! ”  
   
**Geronimo:**   
My spirits, destroyed with a single blow. As expected from the strongest hero of India!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
But I don't understand. You possess such power, yet why?   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...I have my reasons.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Ugh...  
   
**Billy:**   
&ndash;Take this!   
   
**Arjuna:**   
!!!   
   
**Billy:**   
...You can even repel bullets!?   
   
**Arjuna:**   
The fact that a modern weapon like that can harm me is praiseworthy enough.   
   
**Billy:**   
Well, thank you...  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Mmph!   
   
**Arjuna:**   
&ndash;However, it won't reach me. I'm sorry, but I'll settle this now.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Ugh...  
   
**Billy:**   
Ah...Sorry...Geronimo...  
   
**Billy:**   
Dammit, I wish I had been a little more useful...  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...This is the end.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Arjuna...You're decent. You still have a sound mind...  
   
**Geronimo:**   
Why did you join them?   
   
**Medb:**   
Hehehehehe! You can't answer them, can you Arjuna?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
...Queen Medb. To think you'd serve Cú Chulainn.   
   
**Medb:**   
Of course I would. I mean,Cú decided for himself to become king.   
   
**Medb:**   
Not out of righteousness, or nobility, or even ambition. He just wanted to heighten himself.   
   
**Medb:**   
The ones you sent to Alcatraz will be finished off by Beowulf, Fionn, and Diarmuid.   
   
**Medb:**   
Well, even if they fail to, that's not a problem. Your defeat is already certain.   
   
**Medb:**   
So long as we have the Holy Grail,this world will persistently continue to reincarnate.   
   
**Medb:**   
All that's left is to destroy Edison's army. That's easy.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
&ndash;Ah, I see. So you don't actually know yet.   
   
**Medb:**   
...Don't know what?   
   
**Geronimo:**   
It seems you think you're some sort of chosen one, who obtained absolute power&ndash;  
   
**Geronimo:**   
But actually, you're just one out of seven.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
Indeed, the fact you obtained the Grail is proof of your greatness.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
However, while it is rare, it is not the “only one. ”If anyone has the “only one,” it's us.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
They have already recovered four Holy Grails.   
   
**Medb:**   
!!!   
   
**Geronimo:**   
That is why. Even if we fall here...others will take our place.   
   
**Medb:**   
...I see. But none of you have a chance against our king. A Mad King and a War King, Cú stands at the pinnacle of power.   
   
**Geronimo:**   
As a shaman, let me make a prediction for you. Be glad, you'll die happy. Unfortunately, it'll be real soon.   
   
**Medb:**   
&ndash;Hmph.   
   
**Medb:**   
Arjuna. Go and chase down the Servant who escaped.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Understood.   
   
**Medb:**   
Now, Cú. Do you want me to help?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
No, it'll be over soon.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Ugh...  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
You can't maintain the Bounded Field anymore...This is the end.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
...Yes. With so many parts of the theater destroyed, I have no choice but to yield.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
However, I'd like to ask one thing. Consider it a final tribute to the defeated.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;What?   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
It's fine to hone your strength and become a king. Even if the rule you impose is tyrannical.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
However...How can you act without raising one eyebrow?   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
...I'm not trying to cast doubt on your conscience. You're not enjoying this in the first place.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
You're neither a king rewarded by the smiles of your people, nor one striving for your dream.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
What exactly do you seek, then?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I seek nothing. I don't need rewards. I don't even hope for a place to rest at my destination.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
This is how I am. I merely charge forward until exhausted.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
You could say, if anything,wherever my corpse lies is my destination.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
...How absurd. You've decided to live as a king,yet you have no interest in gaining anything as a king.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
You are mistaken. Those contradict each other. The only path for you is to abandon one or the other, Cú Chulainn!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I see. But in reality, as you see here, I'm the victor and you're the vanquished.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Now die, Emperor of Rome.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;It matters not if I'm torn to pieces. “Gáe Bolg! ”  
   
**Nero Bride:**   
Ugh...How disappointing...It seems my performance ends here&mdash;  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
What a pleasant feeling. That pierced not just your heart, but also all your other organs too.   
   
**Nero Bride:**   
...I'm sorry, Lancer. I wanted to...Sing together with you...  
   
**Medb:**   
I see it's over. Now, all that's left is that Servant named Robin.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
You make it sound like there's a survivor. Press the attack and crush them.   
   
**Medb:**   
Yup!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
!!!   
   
**Medb:**   
Cú?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;Over there.   
   
**Mash:**   
This is the designated place.... Master!   
   
**Rama:**   
Hm, Robin Hood's fighting. All right, let's head over quickly!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Sorry, I ended up running into them along the way!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
H-Hey! So what exactly happened out there!?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Well...Here's the gist of it...  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...That's about it.   
   
**Mash:**   
Geronimo, Billy, and even Nero...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...That idiot...We finally got to be summoned in the same era by some miracle...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Sorry, I'll be over there for a while.   
   
**Rama:**   
Sure...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Still, it's impressive that you managed to escape such a situation. Did you use some sort of trick?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I would never have managed to pull it off alone. There was a Servant who lent me a hand.   
   
**Mash:**   
A hand?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Tch...So persistent!   
   
**Arjuna:**   
That goes for us both. I'm sorry, but I must shoot you down.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
Your bow isn't graceful enough. As a fellow Archer, allow me to teach you a few things.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Ugh!   
   
**Arjuna:**   
Hm!?   
   
**D：???:**  
&ndash;Weak, so weak.   
   
**D：???:**  
You're well-trained, but you don't put any heart into your attacks. You're like a child throwing sticks.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Who are you? I pride myself in putting my full might behind that attack.   
   
**D：???:**  
I have no obligation to answer. Just remember me as a god-slayer who happened to pass by.   
   
**D：???:**  
I've decided to allow that boy to escape with his life. Now withdraw, youngster who was merely adored by gods.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Being told that doesn't compel me to withdraw.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;No, stand down, Arjuna. That woman is too much even for you to handle.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I'm telling you, you're in the way. If you're around, you're just going to get hurt.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Or what? Are you trying to hold me back? Does that mean you're a traitor, too?   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Understood.   
   
**D：???:**  
Good, good. Listening to others is a good thing. A good child, unlike you, Sétanta.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Quit calling me by my childhood name. What a headache. To think even you were summoned here.   
   
**D：???:**  
   
Those are my lines, fool. That's not how you speak to your mentor.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
But I've always been like this.... So? Are you my enemy?   
   
**D：???:**  
Why yes. You know how it goes...  
   
**D：???:**  
If you see a rabid dog in your favorite flower garden, you wouldn't just sit around reading, would you?   
   
**D：???:**  
I can't bear to see the fool you've become. Though a fool, you're still my student. I should behead you out of mercy.   
   
**D：???:**  
Now, answer me, Cú Chulainn. What has possessed you?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
......  
   
**D：???:**  
No need to answer, huh?   
   
**D：???:**  
In that case, the only thing left for us to do is fight to the death...However, it seems the circumstances won't allow us to.   
   
**D：???:**  
I must allow that pale...boy in green to escape. You have that burden named Medb behind you.   
   
**D：???:**  
If we fight, things won't end well for either of them. So what'll it be, O king who gained a queen?   
   
**D：???:**  
Lose everything here, and promptly lighten your burden?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
You must be joking. Knowing you, you'd take Medb out the second we start this fight.   
   
**D：???:**  
Of course. I can't stand that woman. So I might just impale her with the best thrust of my life.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
We won't fight here. I'll let that Archer go.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Now you will get out of my sight, too. Come back again when everyone has died off, so no one can stand in our way.   
   
**D：???:**  
Very well, that would be my duty anyway. When you no longer have a way to die, I'll kill you with a smile.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...A shield rune to escape from the battlefield, huh?   
   
**Medb:**   
Not going after them?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
She's not someone who'd go down so easily. She can handle even a thousand spears I throw her way.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I can't win unless I'm ready to die. When I fight her again, it will be when there's no one left to kill.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Robin, the woman who you said saved you...If she's Cú Chulainn's mentor, then she...  
   
**???:**  
I'm right here. Is this some sort of far-seeing spell? I can't say it's in good taste. Poor disposition, too.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
N-Nice to meet you, too...  
   
**???:**  
I should introduce myself. My name is Scáthach. Although I'm sure some of you already realized that.   
   
**Mash:**   
Scáthach! Mentor of Cú Chulainn, and guardian of the Land of Shadows!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
&ndash;Yes, that's right. Oh, needless to say, I'm different from the other Celtic Servants.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Perhaps it's because I am a special being beyond human, that Grail cannot rule over me.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
The reason I materialized as a Heroic Spirit is a special one, too. All of humanity was incinerated, as was my realm.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
And so, being “dead,” I was summoned here. In a proper version of history, I wouldn't even be able to talk to the living.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
From that perspective, I'm glad about the current incident in a way, but...No, there's nothing to be glad about.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
My student was already foolish enough, but now I see him in an even more unsightly, idiotic form.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I came here to put a collar on him and take him back, but it seems there's something on his mind as well.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I considered putting an end to everything, including this era, but then I saw you.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
This war isn't something that Heroic Spirits should settle. It must be solved by human hands.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
That Archer, a part of the cause, was in a dilemma. I couldn't bear not to lend aid.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thank you.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yes, you seem rather ordinary, but...There is strength in your eyes. A good Master, isn't that right, Mash?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, thank you very much. I'm proud of my Master.   
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway, Scáthach. Would you fight alongside us?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
That'd be difficult. I can lend a hand, but I can't join you.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
As I said before, I don't have the means of repairing this era. All I can do is kill.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Also...I doubt I could win against THAT Cú Chulainn.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wh-What!? You're Cú Chulainn's mentor. And even you can't win...  
   
**Scáthach:**   
I'm shocked myself. Nothing can be more irritating.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
That is the Cú Chulainn I know,and at the same time he isn't.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
It's likely because of Medb's wish upon the Grail. She wanted the fool to become a wicked king rivaling herself.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
As a result, a cursed warrior with nothing but the power to become a king was born.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
A Fanged God, or a Mad King, covered from head to toe in spines of death. That is the current Cú Chulainn.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Pitiful.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Most pitiful. That thing is painful. The fool felt even one thorn unmanageable, so he must be out of his mind with a thousand.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
But by paying such a price, he has surpassed me. They say an idiot without hesitation is strong, yes?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That isn't strength. It's simply confining one's life inside a cage.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That's called failure. Dreams that don't reach outside are nothing but delusions.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Indeed. Either way, this isn't just a matter of defeating Cú Chulainn alone.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Considering overall damage, Queen Medb has priority. The Holy Grail must be taken from that woman.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Oh, don't expect much from me. I'd destroy the Holy Grail along with Medb, but that puts you back at square one.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You're right...If the Grail is destroyed, repairing the Foundation of Humanity would be difficult.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That would be a huge time loss for us. If possible, we need to recover the Grail intact.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's consider Lady Scáthach to be our last resort. I want you guys to try defeating Medb by yourselves.   
   
**Mash:**   
Medb...The legendary queen of the Celts.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yes. She's a woman who is honest about her own desires. She's just engrossed in taking over a nation at the moment.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
That woman, along with Cú Chulainn...Those two alone are enough to take any nation.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yet they also have Arjuna. And...I suppose Beowulf is still alive as well.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
He's rather capricious, so we have no idea what he would do. But it's certain that he would side with the enemy.   
   
**Mash:**   
???Doesn't it seem a bit noisy around us?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Hey! They're coming to attack us. What should we do?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Intercept them.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hold our ground.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Yes. I'm super angry right now. I'll strangle them all myself!   
   
**Mash:**   
W-We should go, too. We must retain this camp as the front line for the West!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Wyverns, huh...They'll be difficult for those machines to handle.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Fujimaru, come with me. I'd like to see your talents.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I don't see any Servants with them. Overcome this situation first.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll try.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Got it.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yes, good answer. Now on your way!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Not bad, but how about the next ones?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Wyverns and Chimeras? Curse you, Medb, summoning things like this.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Land and air.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Servants must understand their own roles and the Master must provide appropriate commands to kill those off.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Trouble won't be tolerated. Now go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Next are high ranking warriors among the Celts. Although they've given up their humanity.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
They're as swift and strong as Servants. But if you have trouble here, you'll never reach Cú Chulainn.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Know your Servants, and use them well. Don't disappoint me, understand?   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hm...Shadow Servants have appeared. That Medb seems to understand how to use the Holy Grail.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
These are wraiths that couldn't become Servants. They are one step shy of becoming heroes.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Or they are Heroic Spirits that became shadows due to the summoners' lack of ability, improper summoning circles, etc.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Thus, you could say they're beings closest to Servants. Make sure to defeat them. Humans stand no chance against them.   
   
**Mash:**   
...What?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Hm?   
   
**C：???:**  
&mdash;Haaah!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Wh-What's that!? The black things are disappearing one after another!   
   
**Rama:**   
...A Servant. However, not a Celtic one. He seems to be from near my country...Chinese perhaps?   
   
**Mash:**   
He doesn't look like an enemy. But...is he...an ally?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
&ndash;Regardless, his technique is quite impressive.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Abilities like that are impossible without both innate talent and hellish training to forge one's body.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Excellent. Most excellent. It makes me itch for a good fight.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
You there! What is your name!?   
   
**C：???:**  
Lancer, Li Shuwen! Well met, Servant of twin spears!   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
A storm has been raging within me ever since I caught sight of you. It will not subside until I defeat you. Accept my challenge!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
&ndash;Oh? You challenge me?   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Naturally. I know the reason why I was summoned.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Still...I can't help it. I'm filled with selfishness, after all.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I must try and see if my spear can reach the gods.   
   
**Rama:**   
This man is like a famished tiger, or a starving wolf...  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...What a great potential playthi&ndash; Ahem...I mean, talent worth training.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Lancer, Li Shuwen. If this was the Land of Shadows, I'd train you right away.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
However, I belong to Fujimaru's cause already. Thus, things must be done in order.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
First fight Mash, and win. If you do, I, Scáthach, shall face you directly.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
However, if defeated, you must be gone immediately.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...I see, I understand. Very well, Mash. I hereby challenge you to a duel.   
   
**Mash:**   
But...I don't have any reason to fight.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I am confronting you. Is that not reason enough?   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
If that's still insufficient, then consider me as a Servant sided with the Celts.   
   
**Mash:**   
Master...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We have to fight.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's an enemy.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Yes, I see your Master has good judgment. That's right, I am your enemy. That should be beyond a doubt.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
If you don't treat me as such&ndash;you'll die.   
   
**Mash:**   
I understand...Master! Please provide your orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
H-He is...really strong!   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
No, that's my line. To think you'd stand so well against me...  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
If we were to fight seriously, to the death,I have no idea which way the scales would tip...  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Scáthach, I'd like to rescind my previous request.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Oh, is that okay?   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
All of you perhaps stand a chance against those Celts.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I may be a scoundrel detached from society, but even I don't enjoy watching the world fall to ruin.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
You who's not human...Protect this world with that shield of yours.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I will.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Now then, Scáthach. I have a request. Regardless of whether this world is saved or not&ndash;  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Would you face me at the end?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Very well. That is, if I survive until the time comes.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
You don't seem like one who would die so easily.... Oh right, I have one more thing to tell you.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
This is simply my inference, but it seems the King of Inventions is possessed by something.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Perhaps a good whack in the head will wake him up from his endless dream.   
   
**Mash:**   
Um...Li Shuwen? Would you care to fight alongside us&mdash;  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I'm sorry. I can't say with confidence that I wouldn't attack you if I continued to be around you.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
If I was in my older body, I may have withered and settled down a bit. But I can't help it, as I was summoned in my physical prime.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Why, fate allowing, we may yet fight alongside each other. Farewell.   
   
**Mash:**   
And he's gone.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As expected of Li Shuwen in his prime. So rough, he's like a knife that cuts you just by touching it...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Master, if I may, I believe I should go and see the patient.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What patient?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who's that?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;Edison, King of Inventions.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
According to what that Servant said,he is supposedly possessed by something.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...I agree with his opinion.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Even considering my knowledge as a Servant, that being is too foreign in nature to say he's Edison, King of Inventions.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
In that case, it must be an illness. We should meet with him again.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Things are starting to sound crazy again...He captured you before, yet you want to meet him again?   
   
**Rama:**   
I believe so, too. However&ndash;  
   
**Nightingale:**   
What are you saying? There are many infected areas. In situations like this, triage is important.   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, what should we do?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go see Edison.   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Right. I think that's the correct thing to do, too.   
   
**Mash:**   
I guess it's my intuition as a Servant...I feel like we can't leave him like this.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Then we should go. Immediately. We'll head straight there.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Charge via the shortest route.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
We need to knock that hard-headed man out with some anesthesia, then wake him up.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hm...Robin, Elisabeth, Rama.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
You've heard your Master's opinion. What do you think?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Well, to be honest, my head hurts so much I'd like some anesthesia myself...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'll leave the decision to Fujimaru. Everything until now has been right, so I'm sure it'll be fine going forward.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hmm...I'm a Servant who's better off acting alone. And besides, that...presi-king, was it?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Why would I take the effort to meet someone I know I'd be incompatible with just by how you describe him?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Are you saying you'll just casually go and assassinate Cú Chulainn for us?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I don't do crazy things like that. As long as there are other means, at least.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
If you can't do it, just say so. You just can't honestly admit things, can you?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...To think you of all people would tell me that. I should probably just shut my mouth and go along with it.   
   
**Rama:**   
I have faith in our Master. If we all stand together, we can even defeat Karna if needed.   
   
**Rama:**   
Now, Master. Let's go and wake Edison from his dream!   
   
## Section 14: The Running Man   
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;Master. Celts are attacking the town. We should eliminate them.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Ah, wait a second. Master, sorry for the trouble, but do you think we could capture them alive?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
If we tried to.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm good at things like that.   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? Why do you ask? Do you torture people too?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
No way! An interrogation, if anything!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
If we want to get to Edison's stronghold nonstop, we'll need prisoners like them.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Prisoners? Why? There's no use for them other than relieving my headache.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...Geez. You've gotten a little more decent, but you're still the same at the root.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Oh well, whatever. Anyway, just hold back a bit, that's all I'm asking.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I don't really get it, but okay! Now, let's go, my little [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...Whew. We made it through the battle just fine. We also captured some retreating enemies.   
   
**Mash:**   
Robin, what should we do from here?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
All right, tie them up...There.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Now's the time for me to get to work. You all go elsewhere and eat a meal or something.   
   
**Mechanized Infantry:**   
Halt right there. Identify yourself.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Industry and domination!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Robin!?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's that!?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mechanized Infantry:**   
Industry and domination! Presi-king Edison is the greatest CEO!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
The greatest CEO! By the way, I'm Second Lieutenant Anderson Komadori of the 26th Commando Unit!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I have juicy news! We've captured some enemy soldiers, and they're to be transferred to headquarters!   
   
**Mechanized Infantry:**   
&ndash;Understood and confirmed. They do appear to match our data on Celtic soldiers.   
   
**Mechanized Infantry:**   
Excellent work out there. Please continue through.   
   
**Mechanized Infantry:**   
Industry and...  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Domination! I'll continue with my duties now.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
All right then. All of you, follow me.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Uh, Robin? What was that greeting just now? Are you into stuff like that?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I didn't wanna do it, either! That's the salute among mechanized troops! I had no choice!   
   
**Mash:**   
Domination...Is Mr. Edison, well, perhaps a bad guy?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No. He's a little problematic, but he's probably got a different grasp of the word “domination. ”  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Citizens coming together as one to overcome hardship. Perhaps he thinks of that as “domination. ”  
   
**Scáthach:**   
It wasn't domination for one's own vanity, but a call to action done for the sake of this nation.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Interesting. I heard he was an inventor, but it seems he had political potential as well.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Still, those soldiers were unsatisfactory. They weren't trained at all. That's beyond foolish!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Yeah. By simplifying the thought process, he's trying to improve their reflexes.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
By losing individual instinct and senses, they become tools of automation, completing a single task in large numbers...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Also, it's conceivable they're administering drugs for suppressing fear and doubt. It happens often, but I worry about the aftereffects.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Edison doesn't have the time to raise soldiers, or should I say warriors.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's why he came up with a way for anyone to easily become a soldier.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's a doctrine of mass production and united thoughts...The exact opposite of the Celts.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That said, their opponents are heroes of legend. If this was a modern war, Edison would likely win, but...  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hm...The Celts are disregarding their rear from the get-go anyway.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...In fact, it's not like the Celtic warriors are using much in the way of intelligence...  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Generally, they're muscleheads. Muscleheads versus machines...Yes, they're brilliantly equal in disposition.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Suppressing fear with drugs, huh...Sounds like this side isn't very decent, either.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I shouldn't have hesitated about this. Let's go straight to our target.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Let's take down this self-proclaimed king ASAP!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Whaaaat!?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Don't misunderstand. We're not going to take him down, we're going to treat him.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Although, I can't deny that the treatment procedure may be violent, even quite painful&ndash;  
   
**Nightingale:**   
But in the end, that's still treatment.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I got it, just don't shoot a gun near my ear again!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I'll take it into consideration. Anyway, we should head to Edison's stronghold&ndash;but first...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
It's gradual, but Edison's side is being overwhelmed. We should proceed after treating some Celtic warriors.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That enemy looks like a Bicorn. It's an evil, monstrous horse.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That queen sure does summon some ridiculous stuff!   
   
## Section 15: The King in the High Castle   
   
**Mechanized Infantry:**   
&ndash;Halt. Beyond here is state-owned land.   
   
**Mechanized Infantry:**   
Retreat immediately, and submit an enlistment form to the United Western States Army Mechanized Infantry Corps.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...Tch, they're bloodthirsty. Is this what you'd call a dystopia? Makes me nauseous.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hmm, I rather like it. It's a good thing when peasants follow the rules.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yeah, yeah. I've always been part of the resistance, anyway. But it looks like we can't fool our way through any further.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Master, we need to break in!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Charge!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A rebellion!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Whoa, as I'd expect, Master! I see you're enthusiastic.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Begone! There are patients waiting!   
   
**Rama:**   
Yes, such encouraging words...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If she wasn't kicking opponents around while saying that, it would sound even better!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Hm? What's this, a burst transmission? Huh? What?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wh-Wh-Whaaaat!?   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor!? Doctor, please respond...Doctor!   
   
**Edison:**   
Why you...How could you give in to the Celts! And you call yourselves heroes!?   
   
**Edison:**   
Above all, my Madonna, my Crimean Angel...To think someone with your ideals wouldn't share my own!   
   
**Edison:**   
This is a huge disappointment! I haven't been this sad since the unemployment rate hit 30%!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Disappointment? No, there is still hope. We haven't betrayed you.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Furthermore, us joining the Celts...That's a joke gone too far.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
You fought your way into here, yet you say that?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
According to intel, your assassination of Medb failed. It's rather unnatural that you're still alive.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
You must have begged for your lives, and joined the enemy. Isn't that the normal way to see it, Florence?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What did you say? Begged for their lives, and joined the enemy?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You've got to be joking! She'd never be up for something like that!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Sorry, I must have stepped on a dragon's tail. If I hurt your feelings...No, that was rude of me. Sorry.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
It looks like they're merely losers. I don't see any signs that they've joined the Celts.   
   
**Edison:**   
What? So they were simply defeated? Then did they come here to ask for our protection?   
   
**Edison:**   
I can feel that lust for blood! Oh Angel of Crimea, why do you point your gun at me!?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...An angel, you say? True, I was called that before.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
There's nothing more painful than being compared to a creature as gentle as cotton candy.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
King of Inventions, Edison. After seeing you like this, I understand.   
   
**Edison:**   
Hm, what is it? Have you finally realized my greatness and my intelligence?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You're ill. You must receive treatment immediately.   
   
**Edison:**   
What...was that?   
   
**G：Blavatsky:**   
Ahh...You've said it right to his face...  
   
**Edison:**   
&ndash;How rude. What part of me is ill?   
   
**Edison:**   
These strong limbs. This sound body, bursting with health. This sharp and honed intellect.   
   
**Edison:**   
Everywhere you look, it's so standard!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Be quiet. What's so rude about telling a patient that they're ill?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
If you want to be pampered, go ask your mother or wife.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You have the power to save the world, yet you're trying to bring the world to ruin.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
How is that anything but an illness?   
   
**Edison:**   
You're wrong! I'm&ndash;  
   
**Nightingale:**   
I'll attend to you right now. Just keep quiet, and rest in bed.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What!? Huh? I-I finally got through the hacking.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Th-That's good. I couldn't communicate with you for a while...What happened?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Edison interrupted us.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I-I'd expect no less from Edison. To think he could cut into our communications after just that one peek last time...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Your security's rather weak.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, we've been really careful about security, you know!?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's just, well...Uh...This is Edison we're talking about, so it wasn't much use...Hahaha.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
So shooting a gun stops hacking? I'll remember that, Master!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Forget it.   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
O-Okay, I'll forget it.... So that's no good?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
We don't have time for idle chat. &ndash;Now, we must break through.   
   
**Karna:**   
&ndash;So you've come.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Of course, Karna.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You're also ill. Withdraw at once, you shouldn't be here.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
There's something you desire, after all. I recommend recuperation in a remote place.   
   
**Karna:**   
...You might be correct. I'm infected by an illness called loyalty.   
   
**Karna:**   
Instantly realizing what I desire...Is that due to your occupation as a nurse?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
No, you're simply easy to understand.   
   
**Karna:**   
......I see.   
   
**Mash:**   
Um, Karna seems somewhat depressed.   
   
**Karna:**   
&ndash;Thank you for pointing that out. However, I cannot surrender this path to you.   
   
**Karna:**   
The King of Inventions asked for my aid, after all. He kneeled before a worthless man like me.   
   
**Karna:**   
He was the first to ask. That's more than enough reason to oppose you.   
   
**Karna:**   
...Also, one more thing. Edison resembles a friend of mine.   
   
**Karna:**   
A man clever, yet foolish. Proud, yet full of charity.   
   
**Karna:**   
There was once a king who called me friend. A king who saved me.   
   
**Karna:**   
Edison resembles that amiable man well. To put it simply, I cannot leave him be.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&mdash;How surprising. To think someone like you could smile like that.   
   
**Karna:**   
Even I'm human. I have emotions, like any ordinary person. However, that's enough talk.   
   
**Karna:**   
The first time was testing the waters. This is the second. Show me just how much you have improved&mdash;!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hah...Hah...Hah...Y-You're good!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Stand back. You're at your limit. Umm...Redhorn?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Oh shut up! Some things I just can't give up as a fellow Lancer!   
   
**Karna:**   
Lancer!? Weren't you an idol?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'm taking a break from my idol activities. Right now, I don't have a choice, so I'm holding this spear!   
   
**Karna:**   
...Mm. Return? What an odd order.   
   
**Karna:**   
But&mdash;I see, He wants to decide with his own hands. That's rather arrogant, but perhaps it cannot be helped.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What? Are you running away!? With the win!?   
   
**Karna:**   
I don't think I've won yet...  
   
**Karna:**   
I have orders from my lord to return to the throne. I'll be waiting for you, up ahead in the throne room.   
   
**Karna:**   
Along with this nation's finest...All three of us.   
   
**Mash:**   
This nation's finest...That means...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Servants.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Edison and company.   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Seems about right. Earlier we were speaking over the comms, but I imagine Edison wants to speak in person.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Regardless, it looks like we can't avoid battle before talking to him.   
   
**Mash:**   
...True. I don't think Edison will come around unless he is knocked down once.   
   
**Mash:**   
Let's get things ready first, Master. Then we'll head out.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Now&ndash;entering!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go!   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes!   
   
**Edison:**   
How dare you come here! You reprehensible traitors!   
   
**Edison:**   
Why can you not believe in my righteousness? Are you drowning in conspiracy theories?   
   
**Edison:**   
Like “Edison was the embodiment of capitalism itself! ”and “True geniuses do not idolize business! ”  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Mr. Edison. I believe you're the one easily swayed by conspiracy theories.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
While I have not sensed a sliver of intelligence from you, I do know that your inventions are indeed amazing.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Which is why I have diagnosed that you are ill based on something other than such rumors.   
   
**Edison:**   
Argh! I have no idea what kind of nonsense that is! Nightingale, pioneer of statistics!   
   
**Edison:**   
Why did you materialize as a Berserker? I have no intention of speaking to an unintelligent beast!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Well, aren't you a beast yourself? I mean, you're a lion...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Sigh. Your fever is indeed getting to you. What a waste of intelligence.   
   
**Edison:**   
Mmm!? Lady Nightingale, what did you just call me!?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Pardon me. Slip of the tongue.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Master. Please prepare to operate. First, we need to have him rest on the bed, and make him hear what we have to say.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
You're rather aggressive, Florence. Are you implying you're going to fight him and win?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Yes, I doubt he'll listen to us any other way. So we'll fight, we'll punch, and we'll win.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
I like stuff like that. Very straightforward.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
I don't like fighting...Nor am I good at it. But I suppose I can set aside those feelings for now.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Mr. Edison, are you ready?   
   
**Edison:**   
Y-Yes!? Yes, I'm ready. I'll engage them with all the electricity available!   
   
**Edison:**   
Then they will truly know...How amazing inventions from this King of Inventions are&ndash;!   
   
**Edison:**   
Direct current is just the way to go!   
   
**Mash:**   
...So you still ARE fixated about that!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Edison:**   
Ooooooooh! Not yet...I have not lost yet! I will not surrender!   
   
**Edison:**   
If I do not suffice as a soldier, then I shall give up this body of mine to science!   
   
**Edison:**   
Time for Thomas' great transformation, the big remodeling! I shall cast away this humanoid gentleman's form!   
   
**Edison:**   
Now it's time for a beastly boost! I'll transform into Thomas Mazda Edison&mdash;  
   
**Edison:**   
Gah!? Wh-What was that for, Karna? How dare you throw my superhuman elixir on the floor!?   
   
**Karna:**   
Sorry, Edison. But this ends here...I cannot let you walk the path of destruction any further.   
   
**Karna:**   
Besides, first and foremost,that medicine is bad for your body.   
   
**Edison:**   
No! Good medicine is always bitter to the taste. I can withstand my heart exploding! I'll show you!   
   
**Edison:**   
If I don't hold my ground here,who is going to protect this nation!?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;Protect, you say? For someone trying to protect, you have a rather illogical method of fighting.   
   
**Edison:**   
What...D-Did you just call me...illogical?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Yes. Extremely illogical.   
   
**Edison:**   
I am always logical! Both this nation and I are children of logic.   
   
**Edison:**   
It can't possibly be illogical&ndash;  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...We can't win.   
   
**Edison:**   
...What?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Those Celts are monsters who spend all their time fighting, from birth to death.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
People of this era are already falling behind, right at the starting line.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Moreover, the revered Queen Medb possesses the Holy Grail, allowing her to create soldiers infinitely.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That's why we can't win. There's simply no way to win.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
The Holy Grail is the only resource they need to reinforce their army. The idea of strength in numbers was a mistake to begin with.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
But you didn't let up your ground. Rather, you didn't want to give up that system.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Because&mdash;  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Mass production. Cheaper, more efficient production. That was what you, Thomas Edison, were ingenious at.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
But those aesthetics strip you of the intelligence you originally had.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You thought, “I cannot lose on my home turf. ”And subconsciously, you got worked up over it.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
And because you kept grumbling like that,you were corrupted by such an illness.   
   
**Edison:**   
Erm...W-Well, but...But...Why...I cannot deny that...  
   
**Edison:**   
True, I was fixated on productivity. Even if we run out of resources, as long as we obtain victory at the end...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Indeed. There's no point winning in just the field of productivity. BUT! MOST! OF! ALL!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
The biggest mistake is your body itself!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
There are no records that indicate Edison had the head of a lion.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Furthermore, it is impossible for you to have such strength.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That means you possess power that doesn't belong to you. That is the dream pushing you to become “king. ”  
   
**Mash:**   
Um...isn't that the Holy Grail?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
No. It is not the Holy Grail.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
The Holy Grail can only grant wishes. It does not manifest them.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Edison. Your own desire did not stem from yourself.   
   
**Edison:**   
...That's right. My name is Thomas Alva Edison.   
   
**Edison:**   
I am the Presi-king of the United States of America. Past, present, and future...  
   
**Edison:**   
The successive presidents of this nation granted me power. Because it was logical.   
   
**Edison:**   
They came to the conclusion that even if they were all summoned as Servants, they would lose to the Celts.   
   
**Edison:**   
So, why not concentrate all the power into a single person. Not a president, but a hero with international fame.   
   
**Edison:**   
...They entrusted me with the future known as “America! ”  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The presidents...from the first to the last.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Or rather, the thoughts of those who took up the mantle of president, or what you could call their grudges, had possessed him?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That is the illness. For us, it's not just about America.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
We must heal, we must save this world. That is our Order.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
E pluribus unum.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You are a state made up of many races, equivalent to being children of many nations.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Which is why you have an obligation to save the world.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Yet you divert your eyes and try to save only your own nation&ndash;that is why Edison suffers.   
   
**Edison:**   
Hrng...Guh...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
That is also why&ndash;you were defeated by Nikola Tesla, your fellow inventor.   
   
**Edison:**   
Gaohoooooooooooooo!?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
(She landed the heaviest blow&mdash;! )  
   
**Karna:**   
(...I wish you pulled your punches...)  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I-Is he okay? Mr. Edison, are you alive?   
   
**Edison:**   
GAFU...GAFUUU!   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, he has a pulse, but barely. He's on the ground, but he is still twitching, so...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
He will live. Edison, answer me.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
What is it you want to do?   
   
**Edison:**   
Urgh...Mm...  
   
**Edison:**   
...Yes. I admit it, Florence Nightingale.   
   
**Edison:**   
The successive kings granted me power, but logically that also pointed to the fact that I couldn't win...  
   
**Edison:**   
I have strayed from my path just a little...It seems I was wandering in a maze of foolish thoughts.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Just a little...Just a little bit, was it...Very well.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
To heal an illness, one must first admit that he is ill.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Being lost is fine. Because right now, you have returned to the starting point.   
   
**Edison:**   
I see...Despite all the sacrifices the citizens have made...I am now only at the starting line...  
   
**Edison:**   
This is rough...This is actually rough. What am I supposed to do now...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Huh? You mean you don't know, Edison?   
   
**Edison:**   
Blavatsky...Are you suggesting you do? What I should be doing?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Simple. Do what you would always do. If you fail 3,000 times, you try again with attempt number 3,001.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
You're never discouraged by failure, causing trouble for all those around you. You always find a way to get back up.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
That's your life. Right, Thomas Alva Edison?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
In the end...That was your ultimate talent, right?   
   
**Edison:**   
Blavatsky...I am not sure if I should take that as a compliment or insult...  
   
**Edison:**   
But thank you. You really are my friend. I just need to overcome it...That was my life's conclusion.   
   
**Edison:**   
But I'm a loser. A coward. The King of Lawsuits. Leading a nation again is something I can't possibly&mdash;  
   
**Karna:**   
That's not true. Make no mistake, Edison.   
   
**Karna:**   
You were lost, but you were headed towards the correct location.   
   
**Karna:**   
Saving someone you don't know the name of, or trying to shine light into a world of darkness...  
   
**Karna:**   
I can confidently say that those are desires you can be proud of.   
   
**Karna:**   
No matter how much you blame yourself, or how much you hate yourself, or how you perform evil deeds out of being overly cautious...  
   
**Karna:**   
Unlike heroes who can only save others by defeating something, you do it and have done it with your inventions.   
   
**Karna:**   
As in, not with your words.... Ultimately, you really became a light shining onto the world.   
   
**Karna:**   
Feed off that hope, that accomplishment, and stand up. You're at rock bottom right now, but not all is lost, right?   
   
**Edison:**   
Karna&mdash;  
   
**Karna:**   
Mmm. It is time to wake up, great King of Inventions. There are still so many gems hidden in that brain of yours.   
   
**Edison:**   
...I see. Your world is far from seeing inventions, and vastly differs from mine, yet you still say that.   
   
**Edison:**   
Babbage, my best friend, is telling me in Morse code...That I cannot lose until I am bankrupt.   
   
**Edison:**   
In that case...Yes! The presi-king will never die! He must rise as often as needed!   
   
**Edison:**   
The dream of bringing prosperity to the world has revived! Karna, Blavatsky! Sorry to have caused you trouble!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Don't worry. We're friends.   
   
**Karna:**   
...Right. Though a bit pushy, after coming this far, I suppose we are friends.   
   
**Edison:**   
&mdash;Ha. I'm always blessed with such great friends.   
   
**Edison:**   
Even that hysteric can't match me here. This is what I can call my own fortune.   
   
**Edison:**   
...I also owe you an apology and my thanks,Fujimaru. And to all you Servants who support [♂ him /♀ her].   
   
**Edison:**   
Frankly, I still have no idea. I still don't know how to save the world, or how to defeat the Celts.   
   
**Edison:**   
But&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yup. Let's think about it together.   
  
---  
  
   
**Edison:**   
I am grateful, and I'm counting on you. That's right, I have forgotten something very important!   
   
**Edison:**   
The president always has a vice president by his side. At times, the VP is even more capable.   
   
**Mash:**   
Mr. Edison, then you mean...  
   
**Edison:**   
Yes. I am Thomas Alva Edison. One cornerstone of the foundation for American prosperity.   
   
**Edison:**   
In that case, this time for sure...I want to create an invention that will save this world!   
   
**Edison:**   
Of course, as your Servant, Fujimaru!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It would be my pleasure!   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes! That's great news, Master!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So I've been appointed VP!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ahh, congratulations! Though, that role usually dies first in movies!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Edison:**   
&mdash;I will now bestow myself and all that I have upon you, Fujimaru.   
   
**Edison:**   
Will you save the world together with me? ...My Master.   
   
## Section 16: The Fellowship   
   
**Edison:**   
Now, everyone, have a seat! We're gonna brainstorm, guys!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Yes, teacher! Me, me!   
   
**Edison:**   
Yes, Elisabeth. What is it?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
We invade, and beat them up. That's our only choice!   
   
**Edison:**   
That's...Completely denied!!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Whyyyyyyy!?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...I know! How about we sing to heal their souls?   
   
**Everyone:**   
DENIED!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Whyyyyyyy!?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
They lack the refinement to appreciate it.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They have no tolerance for such things.   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I-I see. Then I suppose there's nothing we can do.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
One needs knowledge to understand music, too. If they don't have that, there's nothing I can do.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We need to wait for death metal to be invented.   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Right, if death metal was&ndash; What'd you just say, little [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Idols! My genre of choice is a cutesy pop idol song, you know?   
   
**Edison:**   
This is what's known as “letting 100 schools of thought contend,” yes? Anyway, all of you, please reassess the current situation.   
   
**Edison:**   
Here's a map. The Celts occupy the eastern half of North America.   
   
**Edison:**   
They'll ultimately invade us from two routes, north and south. They're currently making the preparations to do so.   
   
**Edison:**   
If we were to invade, we would leave one side exposed. They'd overwhelm us, and we'd lose.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Based on data obtained so far, losing too much land will likely be the condition for defeat in this war.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So I presume.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The connection to the era is fragile enough as is, it will sever more as the Celts expand their area of dominance.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In time, this era will no longer withstand its separation from reality...and it will “die. ”  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So, even if we do invade, we have to make sure they don't take any more of our current territory.   
   
**Edison:**   
...That's how it was...Then the fact that I increased the number of troops and pushed back the front line as a stopgap measure...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Ended up saving this nation, yes. The patient was continuously losing stamina, but you protected its heart.   
   
**Edison:**   
Yes...Yes!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
But, that was also your limit. You slightly pushed back the front line, but it won't be long before it falls.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Servants will likely be commanding the invading army.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
At this rate...the mechanized infantry won't stand a chance, and they'll continue to branch out.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
But that was then, right? Now we have a bunch of Servants!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Well, there is some truth to what Eli-Eli is saying. Hmm...Let's first look at our opponents' strength&ndash;  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Queen Medb, Cú Chulainn, Beowulf, Arjuna...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
We may outnumber them, but they have some of the world's greatest heroes on their side...Not just Celtic ones.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Add to that the Celtic soldiers, who can overwhelm even Servants if there are enough.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
And don't forget the monsters and Shadow Servants they pull into the confusion.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
To top it off, they can reproduce indefinitely. Can we defeat them? I can't. Totally impossible.   
   
**Rama:**   
Mmm, hmm...I could keep up at full strength, but&ndash;  
   
**Rama:**   
Defeat? That I cannot guarantee.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Even if we were to just go after the Servants...I mean, I'll do it if you ask me to.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I'd be beaten to a pulp if it's one-on-one. If only there was someone else to help...  
   
**Edison:**   
Hmm...  
   
**Rama:**   
...Mmm...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Now, then...  
   
**Edison:**   
This isn't good...The discussion is coming to a halt. How about we move our bodies a little bit?   
   
**Edison:**   
Fujimaru! You should take this opportunity to join us!   
   
**Edison:**   
This is a virtual skirmish I invented. It's only slightly dangerous!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Edison:**   
Physical activity relaxes the mind,but in the end, there are only two ways to go about this.   
   
**Mash:**   
Is one of them...assassination?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
A select few will go to Washington D. C. , and assassinate Queen Medb.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
That should prevent any further increase in Celtic soldiers. We can turn this into a fight between Servants.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
But Medb is extremely cautious.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Once she senses Servants, she will likely bring all her Servants back at once.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
To be honest, she's already survived one assassination attempt. I would expect her to be even more cautious.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That really hits home.   
   
**Edison:**   
Painfully true. What do you think,Chief Nurse Nightingale? Quite the pickle, isn't it?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...I shall leave military problems of this sort to you. I am just a nurse.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Now, don't say that.   
  
---  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
I'm telling you that I'm useless. Sheesh...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
If an ambush is impossible, we fight them head-on. That's about all I can think up right now.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm...Actually, Nightingale's suggestion is probably the most realistic one.   
   
**Edison:**   
Meaning?   
   
**Rama:**   
We place mechanized infantry and Servants both to the north and south.   
   
**Rama:**   
Of the two armies, one simply needs to hold its ground. Meanwhile, the main army will rush towards the capital.   
   
**Rama:**   
...What do you say, Scáthach?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
That's right. There are several Servants here.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Some Servants are powerful enough to rival the enemy, myself included. However, there aren't enough for “two even armies. ”  
   
**Scáthach:**   
But if we concentrate forces into one army, the other will crumble, and the enemy will occupy America.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
All types of balance must be considered when forming the North and South armies.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Now, how to handle it...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What, that's actually quite simple!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Mmm?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Come on, little [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] over there! Don't just stand around, you pick the parties!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um, me?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you sure?   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Naturally. You fought alongside Servants in France, Rome, and all sorts of other places, right?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
No other Master in the world is as familiar with Servants as you are.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
If you choose the teams,I can trust those decisions!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Oh, Eli-Eli has a point.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Can you stop calling me Eli-Eli!?   
   
**Rama:**   
Hmm, it's just like Elisabeth says. If Master selects the parties, I will be all right with it.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Give me some time.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hold on a sec.   
  
---  
  
   
**Scáthach:**   
No problem. Just think of a team of Servants by tomorrow.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
In the meantime, Edison and his team should prepare for the final battle.   
   
**Edison:**   
Sounds like a plan. Start up the comms! Inform all units immediately!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai. It's a lot of responsibility, but we're counting on you.   
   
**Mash:**   
Sleep on it for a day, if you need to. I believe you've got it in you!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;Taking a walk at this hour?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Change of pace.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...This is also some sort of fate. I shall accompany you.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Edison's wounds are healed. His responsibilities as King of America should've been lessened.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Or perhaps the obsessions of past presidents had been possessing him.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
There is a chance for a poor prognosis, so I need to continue monitoring him...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
One illness left. I only hope then the world will be healed.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll try my best.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah, we have to make it work.   
  
---  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
I have no intention of putting you under any pressure. I hope you don't misunderstand.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Normally, it's insane to have just one person bear the responsibilities of stopping world destruction.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That is indeed a dire move. Only the insane could withstand the pressure.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Like I once was.... But you are different.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You must remain steadfast and assign us to our posts.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I trust you. The same way I trust my comrades who fought against the stubborn army.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You need to make an effort. But there is no need to bear the entire burden.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Moreover, even if your choice is correct,there is the possibility that we, the entrusted, will fail.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Even with utmost preparations,soldiers will die, and people will fall ill.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
So, I hope you do not shoulder too much weight.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Relax, but be honest&ndash;I'm sure we will be fine.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Do you find the night breeze a bit chilly? Let's return.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
The fallen soldiers are on the move. If we leave them alone, their numbers will only increase.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
A corpse is a mound of pathogens. We must carefully mourn them, and send them to the afterlife!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;Now, let's head over to heal our wounded hero.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
My oh my...Even he is but an ill patient to you.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I would've never guessed that you, his mentor, had failed to notice.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I am not good at dealing with illness. After all, having come this close to being a Divine Spirit, illness has lost its meaning to me.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
A straightforward death is something I've long since left behind.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...I don't understand. For one who has traversed death, your expression seems glum?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
But of course. I have not traversed death. Simply, I have overcome it.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yet that doesn't mean I've transcended death. I am merely a ghost who was left behind by life.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
What of yourself? In the sense of ghosts or grudges, I believe you're rather close to me?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I have simply returned to the present world in my peak form. Which is why I shall treat anyone to the best of my ability.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
The fact that I was summoned in itself shows that this world is still in need of “nursing. ”  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm...  
   
**Scáthach:**   
First, the North Army. Elisabeth, Robin, Edison, and Blavatsky.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Then, the South Army. Karna, Rama, Nightingale, Fujimaru, Mash, and myself.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
The North Army might just be barely enough to hold them. However, depending on the enemy's number, the South Army can break through their defense.   
   
**Edison:**   
I see...  
   
**Edison:**   
I'll equip boosters on the mechanized infantry for the South Army so they can keep up with you Servants.   
   
**Edison:**   
Hold the North with as few members as possible, and rush into Washington D. C. with the South Army.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Wait a minute, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]! I want to get at him, too!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm counting on you.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're the only one.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
......  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
......Fine.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
In exchange, Cú Chulainn, the one who defeated Saber...Make sure to take him down.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Understood.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I promise you.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Fine then. I'll fight for you here, along with that Mr. Komadori.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That's not my actual name, you know? Well, you can leave this side to us.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
If we're against an army, my preparations will come in handy. I'll do a thorough job of harassing them.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yes. Our goal is 60% reduction. I'm sure you can do that much.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Against Celtic warriors led by Servants? That'll require double as much work as usual...  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Oh, you can do it with only double? That's amazing, Hermit of the Forest. You've exceeded my expectations.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Ugh, I talked too fast. Normally, it's impossible even with double the effort...  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Maybe if we put our lives on the line, we might make it work. We'll give it our best shot.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
They are counting on us.   
   
I'm just not sure how far we can go with two Casters...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
However, I'll do my best. No matter what the job is, I will see it through.   
   
**Edison:**   
...Mmm. We might've gone down the wrong path, but I'm glad my mechanized infantry can be of use.   
   
**Edison:**   
Allow me to take charge of the North Army.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
No one has any issue with this? Then let's move everybody out.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
This is quite a large-scale operation. I imagine our opponents will pick up on our movements.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
We have to time our attacks simultaneously. Three days from now, at dusk.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Servants in the North Army should move out at once. We must expect the unexpected.   
   
**Edison:**   
True. I trust you with this mission, Madame Blavatsky.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Indeed. Mr. Edison, I wish you the best, as well.   
   
**Edison:**   
Karna!   
   
**Karna:**   
What is it, Edison?   
   
**Edison:**   
Um, well. I've been meaning to say this, but didn't get the chance to!   
   
**Edison:**   
Thank you for answering the request of someone like me! I was able to come this far because you were with us!   
   
**Karna:**   
Don't mention it, Edison, and Godspeed.   
   
**Edison:**   
Thank you, Karna. Now, Master!   
   
**Edison:**   
...I imagine I won't be able to see you again. Though quite brief, you really treated me well.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're a role model for children.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Oh, you're Edison...What can I say?   
  
---  
  
   
**Edison:**   
Hah! Did you read a biography or something? If it was written for children, I must have been so awesome.   
   
**Edison:**   
...I swear I will accomplish this mission, so the real me won't lose to the book me.   
   
**Edison:**   
Then, farewell, my friends!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
All right, guess we'll take off, too. This is our final farewell.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I suppose this is the life of someone engaged in guerrilla warfare. As long as we're alive, we'll meet again.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Not necessarily seeing each other face to face. For example a song or a letter left behind by someone...  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I'm saying we'll come across stuff like that if we survive. For humans, meeting in person isn't the only way to reunite.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
See ya. It was a short while. But I had fun.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...It doesn't bother me. Seems like we're strangely connected, anyway...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I'll probably be summoned into a different era anyway. I might already have a contract as a Servant to begin with.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
There's no way I would die. I am invincible.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Which is why...Well, as long as you avenge Nero, I'll be fine.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Don't worry. You've got some potential as a Master.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
That's right! Why don't I write you a little song to cheer&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ahhh! My stomach! Can't hear you!   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
&ndash;you up. You say you're sick but you look pretty energetic?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Well, whatever...I plan to console the soldiers along the way!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
We've got a long road ahead...  
   
**Scáthach:**   
All right. Time for to head to the front lines. This is the final battle...Don't let your guard down.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Perfect! Why don't I find out if you're really up for the task...  
   
**Mash:**   
S-So suddenly&ndash;!?   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hm, not bad for a practice round.   
   
**Mash:**   
I didn't think I would be nearly killed in a warm-up...  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Oh, nonsense. All right then, Rama, you lead the charge.   
   
**Rama:**   
Huh? I don't mind, but...You're not going to do it?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I'll take my leave here.   
   
**Mash:**   
What!? W-Wait, why!?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I'll be acting on my own and monitoring the actions of Queen Medb and Cú Chulainn. If needed, I'll fight and hold them down.   
   
**Rama:**   
Isn't that like walking to your own death!?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Certainly, if I was some other Servant. But, who do you think I am?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Do I look like someone who'd be gobbled up that easily? Even if they got me, it'd take days.   
   
**Rama:**   
...Still, you already say it like it's inevitable...  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Well. That can't be helped. There must be some sacrifices. After all, someone's got to do it.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Listen. If those two ever make it to the front lines, we will most certainly lose.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I am something like a dam to hold them back. It's on you all to lead this battle to victory.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I am counting on you, Rama. You're still inexperienced, but you have the skill to be a swordsman comparable to my stupid student.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
You have experience leading battles, too. You're essential in our army.   
   
**Rama:**   
...There's no stopping you after such a speech. In life, my army was mostly monkeys...But, well, it'll work out.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Fujimaru...Master. Don't look so worried.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
You've got plenty of Servants now. You have nothing to fear, even if I alone am missing.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Ideally, I would've liked to enjoy the life of a normal Servant, but asking for luxuries can be endless.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Farewell!   
   
**Karna:**   
Master, a word?   
   
**Mash:**   
Karna. What is it?   
   
**Karna:**   
I'd like to stand out as much as possible in the vanguard...Will you allow it?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I guess...  
  
---  
  
   
**Karna:**   
&ndash;Arjuna is on the other side.   
   
**Karna:**   
By nature, he shouldn't be on that side.   
   
**Karna:**   
A born hero, Kiritin...Arjuna is the very embodiment of justice, a true Heroic Spirit.   
   
**Karna:**   
In addition, he and I are connected to each other...For better or for worse.   
   
**Karna:**   
The key to this battle lies in how we immobilize enemy Servants.   
   
**Karna:**   
In which case, I'll concentrate on shutting down Arjuna with everything I've got...Would that be all right?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Please, Karna.   
   
**Karna:**   
Very well. I'll make sure to shut Arjuna down.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do your best.   
   
**Karna:**   
Of course I will. I will not go easy on him.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Karna:**   
I will take the vanguard soldiers, then. Let's go!   
   
**Mash:**   
Karna leading the vanguard. Rama and Nightingale are here with us, too.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yet...I am still worried. Despite being more supported than ever before&mdash;  
   
**Rama:**   
You have good reason to be, Mash. After all, Cú Chulainn is on their side.   
   
**Rama:**   
The strongest soldier, who singlehandedly fought his way through Medb's army.   
   
**Rama:**   
As long as he is against us,there will be no such thing as a sure victory for us.   
   
**Rama:**   
I need not mention Edison and his North Army. We, too, may very well collapse on the battlefield.   
   
**Rama:**   
Nevertheless, to make victory ours...We will give it our all.   
   
**Rama:**   
Now, Master. Your orders.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Aim for the White House!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Begin the advance!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Understood! All units attack! This is the final battle!   
   
**Rama:**   
Take back the United States of America for yourselves! We will lend our assistance as well!   
   
## Section 17: War   
   
**Medb:**   
Hey! Guess what, my king? They're dead. Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid.   
   
**Medb:**   
Looks like the Servants turned the tables on them. You really can't underestimate them, can you?   
   
**Medb:**   
Or, could it be that their Master is even stronger than we thought?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...That's nice.   
   
**Medb:**   
So apathetic. Not interested?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Of course not. The greatest benefit of a dead man is that you no longer have to think of him.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
What interests me is what the living are up to.... Let's see. What do you think they're planning to do?   
   
**Soldier:**   
I have a report.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Ah. Speak.   
   
**Soldier:**   
Yes sir. The United Western States Army split their troops to the north and south. The South Army is advancing towards us.   
   
**Medb:**   
My, they want a final battle?   
   
**Soldier:**   
They're bringing in troops standing by at the rear as well. No doubt about it.   
   
**Soldier:**   
And leading the army is&ndash;  
   
**Medb:**   
It's not Edison?   
   
**Soldier:**   
No, Edison and Blavatsky are in charge of the North Army. The South Army is led by another Servant.   
   
**Medb:**   
...There's more?   
   
**Soldier:**   
Yes. Leading the South Army is a young male Servant,and a Servant with a giant shield.   
   
**Soldier:**   
We have also confirmed a nurse Servant.   
   
**Soldier:**   
Leading the vanguard is Karna&ndash;the thin Lancer with a shining spear.   
   
**Medb:**   
One, two, three...Four!? There are suddenly four more of them!?   
   
**Soldier:**   
Karna's presence had been previously confirmed, but...  
   
**Medb:**   
That still leaves three new Servants!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Probably more than three.   
   
**Medb:**   
Huh?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
My mentor, the Indian rascal, even the Servant I let escape once...  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
On top of it, that shield Servant from the report...That means there must be more.   
   
**Medb:**   
What, no way! Edison partnered up with those guys!?   
   
**Medb:**   
...In other words, they gave up on giving up?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Looks like it.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
He gave up on protecting America,and instead decided to take the world for his own.   
   
**Medb:**   
Hmm, this might not be good, huh? You never know what can happen in an all-out war.   
   
**Medb:**   
What to do?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Hey.   
   
**Soldier:**   
Yes?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
We're off to war. Gather troops.   
   
**Medb:**   
W-Wait...Are you planning on joining the fight!?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Of course. Are you planning on leaving them alone?   
   
**Medb:**   
No, no! In the name of the Mad King, I won't let them be. I'll crush those Servants with my entire army.   
   
**Medb:**   
By advancing on us, they insulted the king and provoked us. Then again, it just goes to show how desperate they are.   
   
**Medb:**   
Desperate people are favorable for me.   
   
**Medb:**   
The despair of those who hate us and spite us is so many shades darker than the ordinary kind, you see?   
   
**Medb:**   
An avenging father slain by his family's murderer, a lover killed by someone whose lover was also killed,  
   
**Medb:**   
I love stories like that. That's why I simply squash them, with my superior resources!   
   
**Medb:**   
Let us divide our army into two forces as well.   
   
**Medb:**   
Leave the North Army to Beowulf, and put Arjuna in charge of the South Army.   
   
**Medb:**   
I'll take care of informing the Servants. Now, go!   
   
**Soldier:**   
Yes!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Taking the scout's report into consideration, their main force is the South Army.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
They're planning to crush our forces with that army and march straight to the capital.   
   
**Medb:**   
The North Army only needs to hold the front. At worst, they're buying time?   
   
**Medb:**   
My oh my...And they call themselves proud Servants?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
That's just how desperate they are.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
That Edison guy has cast aside his pride,and is trying to protect this world and fix history.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
The source is most likely&ndash;the world's last remaining Master that was in the reports.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Medb. How are you reading this?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Servants unleash their greatest powers when they have a Master.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
If they come fighting not as individual troops,but as Servants accompanying their Master   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Is our army powerful enough to defeat them?   
   
**Medb:**   
...Let's see. It might be tough.   
   
**Medb:**   
Beowulf and Arjuna are both top-notch warriors, but they have no will to fight.   
   
**Medb:**   
You could say Arjuna has a reason to fight, although it's a very personal one.   
   
**Medb:**   
But Beowulf is only barely following orders. I can't imagine him losing...but...  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Medb. We're going all in.   
   
**Medb:**   
!!! O-Okay.   
   
**Medb:**   
But I need time. Setting the North aside, the South&ndash;  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I'll hold the South down.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Arjuna can lead the charge,and I'll destroy all the Servants I can get my hands on.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
After all, they've got that woman.   
   
**Medb:**   
...Scáthach?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Yeah, she IS my mentor. I can't imagine any other man being able to handle her.   
   
**Medb:**   
&ndash;Do you want to fight her?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
No. I am a king. A king doesn't fight for self-interest.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I am the frame in establishing this nation. I'll devote myself to being a weapon slaughtering opponents.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
As long as Karna lives, Arjuna won't have the composure to deal with other Servants.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
If that is the case, I'll go. I'll go, and I'll kill.   
   
**Medb:**   
Very well. I won't stop you. Ride forth, my king!   
   
**Medb:**   
Hahaha, hahaha, hahahahaha! The least kingly king in the world.   
   
**Medb:**   
Despite having no intention of unifying the nation,you devote yourself to its creation.   
   
**Medb:**   
That's why you never lose. You always kill the opposition. Once all opposition is gone, you may even turn on your allies.   
   
**Medb:**   
...Perhaps that's the very thing I've been desiring most.   
   
**Medb:**   
For a king such as you to throw everything in this world into chaos.   
   
**Medb:**   
To wipe out everyone equally, with your Gáe Bolg.   
   
**Medb:**   
Oh believers of justice and miracles...Hurry up and come here! Let me lead you to your unsightly death!   
   
**Mash:**   
...A message from Karna!   
   
**Karna:**   
We've engaged the enemy vanguard. We defeated them, but several troops are headed your way.   
   
**Karna:**   
Sorry, but we don't have any forces to spare. Please stop them, Master.   
   
**Rama:**   
I'll take the right wing. Nightingale can handle the left. Mash, you break through the middle...Can you do that?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, I can!   
   
**Rama:**   
Good. Then let's go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;All done!   
   
**Rama:**   
...Their vanguard is this big? They must've figured out the South Army is the main force, and sent in their elites.   
   
**Rama:**   
It looks like it.   
   
**Rama:**   
The all-out clash is coming soon. Everybody, stay on guard!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Nothing less from the king of Kosala. Such tremendous charisma, no matter how you look!   
   
**Rama:**   
Can I consider that a compliment? So convoluted...  
   
**Rama:**   
Wyverns are coming, huh? All right, Master...Let's crush them!   
   
## Section 18: The Killing Fields   
   
**Rama:**   
If we continue to proceed at this pace, we can expect all armies to clash in the wilderness ahead.   
   
**Mash:**   
...It's going to be quite a large-scale war.   
   
**Scout:**   
Commander Rama! We've confirmed the Celtic army at a point 20 klicks ahead.   
   
**Scout:**   
Leading them is a brown-skinned male Servant holding a giant bow.   
   
**Rama:**   
...Have you told Karna yet?   
   
**Scout:**   
Yes sir, General Karna has already been informed.   
   
**Rama:**   
Very well.   
   
**Rama:**   
Tell all troops to not engage with that man, even if we enter battle.   
   
**Scout:**   
Yes, sir!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...It's Arjuna, isn't it.   
   
**Rama:**   
Most likely. Good grief, this is like a scene from a nightmare.   
   
**Rama:**   
Arjuna...The legendary hero. The Mahabharata is practically all about him.   
   
**Rama:**   
He grasps victory in every battlefield. Even Karna once suffered a crushing defeat.   
   
**Rama:**   
Is there any way we can win this?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There is.   
  
---  
  
   
**Rama:**   
...Hm, interesting.   
   
**Rama:**   
You declare it to be so, Master,but you probably have absolutely no basis behind it.   
   
**Rama:**   
Yet somehow, I feel as if we can win.   
   
**Mash:**   
Me, too. Somehow, having your guarantee makes my hair stand on end!   
   
**Rama:**   
Hahaha. Brilliant. Like the dawn of a new year!   
   
**Rama:**   
Heh. A good Master and good Servants. It's no wonder we've made it this far.   
   
**Rama:**   
Thanks to that, I have no doubts either. I merely wield my sword as your Servant!   
   
**Rama:**   
...They're coming!   
   
**Arjuna:**   
&ndash;There you are, Karna.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
You all go fight the Servants. I have&ndash;business with that Lancer.   
   
**D：Soldier:**   
Yes.   
   
**Rama:**   
Enemy forces, including wyverns, should be handled as discussed during our march!   
   
**Rama:**   
They're strong, but that's all they are! There's no need for fear!   
   
**E：Soldier:**   
...  
   
**Rama:**   
All of you have a duty to protect this land! And I don't mean because you are the owners!   
   
**Rama:**   
Since you've taken it, it means you're responsible for it until the end!   
   
**Rama:**   
Thousands and thousands of lives are depending on each of you.   
   
**Rama:**   
This war cannot be decided by heroes alone! This war has no meaning unless it's won by each and every single one of you!   
   
**Rama:**   
Go make victory your own! Now, charge!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, Karna's unit has broken through. The right and left wing units are headed this way!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's do this.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'll surely win.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes! Mash Kyrielight&ndash; Here I go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Rama:**   
Look out! Wyverns! Fire the Anti-Air Electromagnetic Net Launcher!   
   
**Soldier:**   
Commander, it's not just an Electromagnetic Net Launcher, but an Edisonian Direct Current Electromagnetic Net Launcher!   
   
**Rama:**   
He's picky about that kinda stuff!? Servants, take down the ones who slip through the net!   
   
**Mash:**   
Copy that! Master, your orders please!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
The soldiers keep coming, don't they?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Give me every bandage we have!   
   
**Celtic Soldier:**   
YAAHHH!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Out of my way!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I'm sorry, please defend this place until I'm done with treatment!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay.   
  
---  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
I appreciate it!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Treatment is mostly complete. I've sent those unfit for battle toward the back.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, is Karna safe?   
   
**Mash:**   
Seeing as Arjuna isn't here,I imagine they are in combat&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Amazing.   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's the very reenactment of mythology! Nothing less from a top Servant. Off the charts in every way!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Arjuna:**   
&ndash;So you've come, Karna.   
   
**Karna:**   
No matter when or what era. Only I can ever be your opponent.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
Each time I am summoned to a Holy Grail War as a Servant, it seems I always end up searching for you.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
While attempting to be a proper hero...I would seek you, and be disappointed.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Never again will we have an opportunity such as this.   
   
**Karna:**   
...  
   
**Arjuna:**   
The moment you stood before me,all my other priorities evaporated.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
&ndash;So, Karna. Shall we begin where we left off?   
   
**Karna:**   
...We shall, Arjuna.   
   
**Karna:**   
Both you and I seem to be held captive by a chronic disease that can never be cured.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...However.   
   
**Karna:**   
Yes.   
   
**Both:**   
&ndash;That is our very delight.   
   
**Karna:**   
This world has no gods, no curses, not even destiny.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
Precisely because there aren't, I made facing you my only desire upon the Holy Grail.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...And now, that wish has come true. I have no interest in saving this world.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
If it is to perish, it shall perish. Yet, you attempt to save it&ndash;this world.   
   
**Karna:**   
Of course. As long as people wishing to live proper lives exist, I will continue to protect them.   
   
**Karna:**   
I was given this power for that purpose. Know that as long as my father and my life remain, the sun remains immortal.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
That is why I am for destruction. If you stand with the good, I shall stand with the evil.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
That is equality. This time&mdash;surely this time, I must put an end to your very existence as my equal!   
   
**Karna:**   
...Now then. Arjuna. Do you know the saying“Curses, like chickens, come home to roost”?   
   
**Arjuna:**   
?   
   
**Karna:**   
No, it's nothing. There was once someone who taught me that. Watching you just reminded me of him.   
   
**Karna:**   
Like it or not, we've known each other the longest. On account of that, promise me one thing.   
   
**Karna:**   
If you defeat me, fulfill your original duty as a Heroic Spirit. Save the world with your “Agni Gandiva. ”  
   
**Karna:**   
...I hate to admit it,but you're far better at that sort of thing.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Very well. But once it's decided,don't make that your reason for defeat.   
   
**Karna:**   
Never. I would never fight for defeat.   
   
Upon my spear, upon my armor, I swear it.   
   
**Karna:**   
I swear upon my father and mother&ndash;that victory will be mine.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
I also swear victory upon my parents&ndash;and my brothers.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
After tens of thousands of years,I've finally obtained this chance!   
   
**Arjuna:**   
Not even evil spirits out there can interfere with me!   
   
**Both:**   
&ndash;Here I go!   
   
**Rama:**   
Whoa, that queen...Don't tell me she even called a giant dragon to attack us!   
   
**Rama:**   
But if we defeat it, it's just one more push before their front line crumbles! Let's do this!   
   
## Section 19: North American Myth War (Beginning)   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Life signatures eliminated! ...Whew, what an ordeal. Had me scared a bit.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, how's the northern front doing?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Don't worry, they've been holding it. This might be possible after all!   
   
**Karna:**   
HAAAAAA&ndash;!   
   
**Arjuna:**   
SHAAAAAA!   
   
**Rama:**   
It's Karna and Arjuna! What a chaotic battle!   
   
**Rama:**   
All forces, keep away from those two! You'll be caught in the crossfire!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Ever so slightly, Karna is overpowering him.   
   
**Rama:**   
Ah, you can tell, Nightingale?   
   
**Rama:**   
After all, an Archer shines in long-range combat. Being so closed in on, even the great Arjuna cannot handle him.   
   
**Rama:**   
Then again, normally Karna would be overwhelming in a situation like this.   
   
**Rama:**   
Yet the two appear to be nearly on par with each other. As expected of the great Arjuna!   
   
**Rama:**   
And yet&ndash;if things continue this way...  
   
**Karna:**   
...Tch!   
   
**Arjuna:**   
Ugh&mdash;!   
   
**Rama:**   
Karna will win!   
   
**C：???:**  
&ndash;“Gáe Bolg. ”  
   
**Mash:**   
What...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
!!!   
   
**Rama:**   
Wh-What&ndash;!?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Servant responses have suddenly...Wait, what just happened!?   
   
**Arjuna:**   
!!!   
   
**Karna:**   
...  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Don't hate me, Hero of Benefaction. After all, this killing spree has no rules.   
   
**Karna:**   
...Cú Chulainn...  
   
**Arjuna:**   
Cú Chulainn...You bastard!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;Shut up. Starting a fight without consulting me...Did I approve a one-on-one?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Wait until you've read the situation before running after your own interests.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
At least be grateful that you weren't stabbed from the back, Hero of the Endowed.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
!!!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Now let's see&ndash;Is that the famed Master?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
!!!   
  
---  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
What, shaking all over? My mistake for thinking you'd be a veteran hero.   
   
**Mash:**   
Y-You're...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Caster from Fuyuki!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The one we fought with back then!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Sadly, I don't remember that. A completely different guy.   
   
**Mash:**   
But...  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash, calm down.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash, he's an enemy.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, I know.   
   
**Rama:**   
Wait, Cú Chulainn! What happened to Scáthach&ndash;  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Hm? Oh, I defeated Scáthach.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
!!!   
   
**Rama:**   
...You don't mince your words, do you?   
   
**Mash:**   
No, not Scáthach...Impossible...  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Oh yeah, no need for condolences.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
You're all going to die here, too. Go lick each other's wounds on the other side.   
   
**Rama:**   
He's coming! Don't hold back on Command Spells, we'll fight with all we've got!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Hah...Hah...Hah...  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
The strength of that shield...Strange. I don't recall a shield so powerful, not even in folklore.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
But it's definitely a Noble Phantasm. Girl, that shield&mdash;  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Never mind. It won't matter if I take you down, anyway!   
   
**Rama:**   
Noble Phantasm incoming, Mash! That vermilion spear aims for your heart no matter what!   
   
**Rama:**   
You have to run at full speed!   
   
**Mash:**   
It's no use, I won't make it!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
It's go time&ndash;My demonic thorn of death.   
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
What...  
   
**H：???:**  
Dozing off as I stroll along,I find myself in a strange land of wilderness.   
   
**H：???:**  
Is this the dream continued, or merely an illusion? Well, not that it matters.   
   
**Merlin:**   
Good morning and hello, all. Everyone's trusted advisor, Mr. Merlin, is here.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mer...Who?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who's that cocky fellow!?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Merlin:**   
Right, you, never mind that. This appearance is a special service, an incognito visit totally on a whim.   
   
**Merlin:**   
Your paths and mine are not yet set to cross. I mean, I should be a shut-in from a tower in paradise to begin with.   
   
**Merlin:**   
Just consider this a lucky visit from a wonderful gentleman and be done with it, okay?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
So&ndash;what kind of blockhead are you? Is this what they call a daydream?   
   
**Merlin:**   
Of course. It's my ol' specialty,making do by confusing the opponent!   
   
**Merlin:**   
Oh! Congratulations on your coronation, Cú Chulainn.   
   
**Merlin:**   
To think the day would come when the great hero of Ireland settles down on a throne. My, my, destiny is a strange thing.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
This feeling...You must be an incubus...Which means...I see, you are the Stargazer.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Your meddling is breaking the rules. Is this fine, mage? Your pride will crumble to pieces.   
   
**Merlin:**   
Not to worry, we'll play it by ear. Besides, I have no pride or principles, or anything like that.   
   
**Mash:**   
Who&ndash;are you&ndash;?   
   
**Merlin:**   
I watch everything in this world from an island in the farthest lands. Yes, I watch everything.   
   
**Merlin:**   
That's the important point. I am but an observer, simply observing...At least for now.   
   
**Merlin:**   
...Whoa, I really am about to wake from my nap.   
   
**Merlin:**   
Sorry, but this is about all the help I can lend you. You'll have to finish slaying that beast on your own.   
   
**Merlin:**   
Once you have done so,the future in which we meet shall come.   
   
**Merlin:**   
Farewell, then, until that slightly altered future. Take care of Cath Palug for me.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Tch, behind me!   
   
**Karna:**   
Burn him to ashes...“Vasavi Shakti! ”  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Tch!   
   
**Mash:**   
Karna!   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...  
   
**Karna:**   
It wasn't strong enough...to reach him...Master...farewell...  
   
**Rama:**   
...Karna...  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
One last struggle at the very end. This is why I never trust the comings and goings of spearman.   
   
**Rama:**   
Quit babbling, now's the chance&ndash;!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Right back at you, scumbag! Flaunting your borrowed feathers...  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
That attack left me scorched all over. I'll be going home to cool off now.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...It's no use fleeing, Cú Chulainn. No matter how great your fury, that wound will never heal.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You are ill.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Ha. It's as you say, bloody saint. The day I'm healed will probably never come.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I'll simply continue being king,until the day I fall and rot.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;Come and get me, if you can. I'll fight you in Washington.   
   
**Rama:**   
...Don't let this opportunity pass! All forces push, push, push!   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...  
   
**Rama:**   
I am sorry Arjuna, but I must kill you!   
   
**Rama:**   
Er, Nightingale!?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;Arjuna. Have you any desire of receiving treatment?   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Treatment? What illness do you think I have?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Karna tried to be a Servant. That is all.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Despite trying to be a hero with a second life, you do not wish to be a Servant.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Our existence sides with neither. We have our self-interests, yet we also have a given Order.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
In that moment, Karna acted as a Servant, and believed that stopping Cú Chulainn would lead to victory.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...He believed that it was the right thing to do than indulging you with your deep-rooted obsession.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Obsession? My long-standing desire...  
   
**Arjuna:**   
How could the likes of you ever understand!?   
   
**Rama:**   
H-Hey, Nightingale. Er, maybe you shouldn't provoke him too much!?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;It's a mistaken obsession. No use crying over spilt milk. Defeating a nemesis with an arrow you shouldn't have shot&ndash;  
   
**Nightingale:**   
You must live the rest of your life with that regret. That's how it is for other heroes, too.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Madly wishing to redo, seeking a wish never granted.... Despite that, a Servant doesn't cross that final line.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You did not try to understand that final line.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...I...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Will you fight? If you would like to, you may.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...You're right. There's no need to fight. I don't even want to vent my anger.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
But I...want to settle the score. In order to purge this unmanageable something in my heart.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
I'll understand if you decline.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's fight.   
   
**Rama:**   
H-Hey!? Master, you're going to fight Arjuna!?   
   
**Rama:**   
Who is!? We are, yup, of course!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'll win.   
   
**Rama:**   
Hahahahaha, Master! I've got something to say to you, as a fellow warrior!   
   
**Rama:**   
There's no telling whether we'll win. After all, our opponent is Arjuna!   
   
**Rama:**   
Ah, what the heck! Let's do this!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
&ndash;Thank you. Then let us battle, if you please.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
My name is Arjuna. Consider it an honor&ndash;to fall by my arrow!   
   
**Rama:**   
I also have the pride of having bested the Demon King Ravana. &ndash;Prepare yourself, Arjuna!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Rama:**   
How's that, Arjuna!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Do you feel better now?   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Yes, very much. I appreciate you putting up with my self-indulgence.   
   
**Mash:**   
Arjuna. Well...If you wouldn't mind, could you lend us a hand?   
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Unfortunately, I cannot. Though I strongly desire to.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
I'll be sure to make amends for what I've done. Will you please believe me?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I will.   
  
---  
  
   
**Arjuna:**   
...Your words ring true, even in my hollowed heart. Farewell, then.   
   
**Rama:**   
...Arjuna...What did he...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
It means he was able to sort out his feelings.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
He is not as faithful as others think,nor as evil as he himself believes.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
He must've led quite a stifling life when he was alive.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
After all, he'd been living a life that was decided for him by someone else.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Oh, I see. Arjuna must have wanted a fresh start.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That day, that moment, that arrow he shot at Karna...He'd been regretting it all his life.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
His illness has been cured. Though the price he paid...was all too great.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
But despite that, we must forge ahead.   
   
**Rama:**   
Nightingale is right. All right, march on! Let's charge all the way to Washington!   
   
## Section 20: North American Myth War (Middle)   
   
**Rama:**   
Forward! The northern front has already clashed with the main army! There's no telling how long they'll last!   
   
**Rama:**   
Speed! Speed will determine the winner! Full speed ahead!   
   
**Rama:**   
Master! Enemy forces are straight ahead!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Crush them!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Blow 'em up!   
  
---  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Yes! All troops, charge!   
   
**Rama:**   
No stopping, not even for a moment! We'll come down on them in one giant blow!   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's the matter?   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm sorry. I was thinking of Scáthach.   
   
**Mash:**   
Scáthach said she could never defeat Cú Chulainn, but I didn't believe her.   
   
**Mash:**   
I felt nobody could ever defeat Scáthach. So&mdash;there was a part of me that wasn't worried.   
   
**Mash:**   
A part of me that thought, even if we failed here, Scáthach would set it right.   
   
**Mash:**   
But, it didn't turn out that way.... Scáthach was right.   
   
**Mash:**   
But, I still don't understand. I don't understand how Scáthach could've lost...  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;“Gáe Bolg! ”  
   
**Scáthach:**   
“Gáe Bolg Alternative&ndash;! ”  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Ugh!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
A clash of Gáe Bolgs, unimaginable during our lifetimes.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Both claim to deliver fatal blows,while at the same time evading them.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
With different Noble Phantasms, this would've ended in death, not a draw. But both our Noble Phantasms are forbidden magical spears.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Both thorns of death trace identical paths and clash. A curious phenomenon&ndash; one that may never occur again.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...But my, that right arm of yours. Have you been repairing it with rune spells as you throw your spear?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Pretty much.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
You're not waiting until the destruction ends to begin regenerating, unlike me.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
You're regenerating while it is being destroyed. The pain must be excruciating...No, I am sure “excruciating” is not even enough to describe it.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Pain can be managed. I'm already prepared for the worst.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;Hmph, you've been enduring it well too, my mentor.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Not really.... In the end, I'm merely buying time.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
In the past&mdash;I've even dreamed of being killed by you.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...  
   
**Scáthach:**   
“I should've died before things became this way,” I thought. If I regret anything about my life, that would be it.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
&ndash;But, I have no desire to be killed by your current self. Personally, I preferred your previous self.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I'm not obligated to shoulder any of the burden you bear. My path is simple and straightforward.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I can't afford to be taking detours,nor can I afford to carry someone else's baggage.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I'll take the shortest path to be king, and to rule.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
&ndash;For whom? Is it for Medb?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Medb wished upon the Holy Grail, and made you into a king. But that was never your wish.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
What makes you think so? Do you really think I've never dreamed of becoming king?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
You never mentioned such a dream when you were alive.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
True. Just as you say&ndash;in life,the thought of becoming king never crossed my mind.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
However. Isn't it common for Servants to harbor new dreams that might not have existed when they were alive?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...So, it's the opposite. You're trying to become a king as a result of becoming king.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
&ndash;What a foolish contradiction. Despite becoming king, nothing indicated you became one.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
That's why you have to destroy everything.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
If a man stands alone in the deserted wilderness,then indeed, he must be the unopposed king.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Yeah, that's fine by me. That solution feels best. A hero's existence is full of contradictions, after all.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
It's not for Medb. I brandish this spear for my own self-interest.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Now, you must be running out of ways to stall for time. Let's put an end to this, Scáthach.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
&mdash;Such an idiot. You're an idiot down to your bones, yet you're thinking so hard.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
But no matter. I'm finished with my questions. Gates, open.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;Tch!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
“Gate of Skye. ”  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
A Noble Phantasm that transports people to the Land of Shadows!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I'm sorry, but I'm taking you with me.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
My mentor...You must've sensed it. That you can't defeat me.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
You know you can't win, even using that Noble Phantasm, yes? &ndash;That's correct.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
A Noble Phantasm that transports, yet doesn't kill&mdash;Your consideration for others this late in the game is why you will lose.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Noble Phantasm seal. Transform&ndash;!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Wh-What?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
!!!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;You stopped moving, Scáthach!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Gah!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
“Curruid Coinchenn”&ndash;This is one trick I didn't learn from you.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
This Noble Phantasm is the one and only thing that can punch a hole in that gut of yours.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...So you've reached that far, huh? That's enough power to destroy the world.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I bet it is. As things stand, I'll be doing just that.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
&ndash;Cú Chulainn. That's what I don't understand.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Living and fighting. Those used to be your greatest joys.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Those were the big prerequisites. That is why you lived so beautifully.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yet why do you insist on being so ugly?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...I'm ugly, yes. Because as far as I've seen, that's what a king is.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...What......Who knew you were such an honest idiot?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Goodbye, Scáthach. We'll probably never meet again.   
   
**C：???:**  
Too bad. As a fellow spearman,I would've liked to try fighting him, but&ndash;  
   
**C：???:**  
I had to prioritize a previous appointment. You alive?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Somehow. Jumping through the gates myself to fling my body to the outsides of the world must've worked.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I've patched up my outward appearance, but that's about it. To put it into perspective, 90% of my organs are destroyed.   
   
**C：???:**  
Hm, that's a problem. You can't fight like that.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
If we were to fight, it'd be when this era ends. Until then, Shuwen, would you help those guys out?   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Which side?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...The North Army. The South Army has Fujimaru, but the North Army doesn't. This is a big difference.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
All right. Then I'll head to the North Army. You stay here, until the era comes to an end.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I'll be sure to come back for you. Whether the era ends, or the world ends. I promise.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
After all, that divine spear has reached a realm beyond human understanding. If you disappear before I fight it, I'll surely go mad.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Suit yourself. How can I refuse so earnest a request?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Fine. I look forward to your return. If you don't mind a cowardly spear that lost to its disciple.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Kaka! I wouldn't count that as a loss. Your objective was different from the start.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Realize the competition of spears has just begun, mistress. Time to see if my divine spear will stand up to a true god.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...Well, I suppose I should save the world first, though. Too bad. All I want to do is fight strong opponents...  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...but the world is such a hard place to live in.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
That is the fate of us Heroic Spirits.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Hahahahaha&mdash;that's for sure.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yeah, yeah. Here they come again.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Wait a second, how many of them are there? They just keep coming!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Did you really clean up 60% of them?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Well yeah, of course. I take my work seriously. It's one of my few redeeming qualities.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Poisoning their food and water, burning, drowning, dropping rocks...Even some treachery amongst them.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I used all sorts of tricks to cut out 60% of them. But there's still many left. Don't you just hate it?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...Seriously, what is it with those guys?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Normally when you lose 60% of your troops,morale plummets and retreat is par for the course.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I suppose there is one exception, though...  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
The case of ridiculously strong leaders being ridiculously tyrannical.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Encore after encore no matter how much I sing...I feel lucky as an idol, but I'm not happy about this!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That's just our job this time around.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
How are they doing over there?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...Karna was killed in battle.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...I see. That guy was crazy strong, too.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Don't tell Old Man Edison. He'll probably sink into depression.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I figured as much. Is the [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] doing all right?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yeah, they defeated Cú Chulainn, who then retreated. They're marching toward Washington with Rama and the others.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Our tasks remain the same?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Not sure about that. Hey! Old Man Edison!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Should we keep going!?   
   
**Edison:**   
Hahahahaha! Of course, sounds good!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Looks like it.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Ah, too bad. It's tiresome, but I guess we can give it one more push.   
   
**Edison:**   
Direct current is the best! Am I right!?   
   
**Mechanized Infantry:**   
Of course, Mr. Presi-king! All hail direct current! Brilliant domination!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Yes, yes, direct current is the best, the best. And now...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
&mdash;Behold, the Book of Dzyan in my hand. Light, shine here. Hierarchy in the heavens, Lemuria in the sea.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
And on earth, myself! Old things and new, make everything clear!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Everything seems to be going smoothly...But life never goes so well, does it?   
   
**Edison:**   
...Hm. Yes, it'll be here soon, without a doubt.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh, what'll be here? ...Wh-What the...  
   
**Beowulf:**   
&ndash;Life never goes so well, does it?   
   
**Beowulf:**   
...Wait, is this it? A cunning Archer and a scrawny Lancer?   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Where are the people who defeated me?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
They're out. And it's “slender,” not scrawny!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hey, was that a compliment?   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Yes, it's a compliment. Cutting us by 60%, just by laying traps.... But with 40% left, victory is ours.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Ugh, I can't stand it.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Crude, insensitive, and shameless. On top of that, muscles, tattoos, and stubble!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Nothing could be more vulgar! That settles it! You take him.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I'd like to say “Yeah, sure”&ndash;But I'm afraid I may die without your help.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What a slacker.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
My only talents are long-range combat, killing with poison, and sabotage.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Then go stand behind me and shoot your little arrows.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Bring it on, half-naked man. Having one dragon slayer is more than enough!   
   
**Beowulf:**   
I'd appreciate it if you'd at least call me by my True Name, scr...slender Lancer!   
   
**Edison:**   
Can you go assist Elisabeth and Robin Hood!?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
That's impossible. It's taking all I can to hold back the Celts! You little...  
   
**Edison:**   
...Alas, when it comes to tenacity, we just can't match these Celtic soldiers...How disappointing.   
   
**Edison:**   
So these are the limits of mass production...No, not true! It's just that my approach was incorrect!   
   
**Edison:**   
I can't lose. I must grasp the glory of success someday! As the one responsible, I must make an effort!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Ugh...  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Hmph!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Bastard!   
   
**Beowulf:**   
&ndash;Ha!   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Sorry. Despite being a Berserker, I'm not really insane.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
If anything, I'm just a little more ferocious. I don't easily lose the techniques I've cultivated.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Damn it, I hate these types...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Eli-Eli and Robin are in trouble. Not good!   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
&ndash;Then allow me.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Huh!?   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Whoa.... Hey now, who are you?   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Just a passing divine spear. My True Name is Li Shuwen.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...Hmph. I suppose it's a perk for this job. To be able to fight the famous Beowulf. The highest honor.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Oh? Not one for modesty with a name like “Divine Spear. ” Li Shuwen...Yes, I've heard a lot about you.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Oh, it's just an old nickname. So, what shall we do?   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Beowulf. You're the warrior known for killing the monster Grendel with your bare hands. In that case&mdash;  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Heh, you sure know how to flatter. And who were you, again?   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Ah, yes, yes. “No Second Strike,” right? Don't need a second strike! What a claim!   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Hm. How about we put it to the test? We'll see if it's real or an exaggeration.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
What a coincidence, for two Servants who can fight unarmed to meet in this place.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Fate is such an odd thing.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
It sure is strange. Which means...  
   
**Beowulf:**   
...a so-called fistfight?   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I don't know whether these fists will work on you or not. But I think I'd like to give it a try.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Let's see you withstand my Bajiquan!   
   
**Beowulf:**   
That's fine. Many winters have passed since my honoring as a Heroic Spirit.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Yet it's hard to forget that feeling...That moment when I beat that guy to death.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
And now, a guy who looks even stronger than Grendel is standing before me.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
So&ndash;no one would turn down such an opportunity!   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Indeed!   
   
**Beowulf:**   
One.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Two...  
   
**Both:**   
Three!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Whoa! A f-fistfight! Is it a fistfight!?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
This is so scary! Stop them, Greenie!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
No thanks! Even God couldn't stop a fight like this!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Wow, man, it's hard to believe we're the same species.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
What's with that? Sometimes I don't get how men think at all.   
   
**Edison:**   
Oh, come on. Girls box too, don't they? All warriors dream of a fistfight. It's their instinct.   
   
**Edison:**   
...Although, being an inventor,I wouldn't know much about it.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Whatever.   
   
**Edison:**   
Either way, the only Servant who could ever stand up to Beowulf in a fistfight is him.   
   
**Edison:**   
Let's leave Beowulf to Li Shuwen. We should focus on doing what we can.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
You're right. But Edison, I...have a bad feeling about this.   
   
**Edison:**   
...Your bad feelings are always on the mark. Whatever is to come, let us be prepared.   
   
**Rama:**   
All right! Mostly done&ndash;What!?   
   
**Rama:**   
Medb's elite soldiers...Shadow Servants! Master, we should handle this! Your orders, please!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Rama:**   
...All Shadow Servants have been eliminated!   
   
**Mash:**   
We're almost at the capital, Washington. Cú Chulainn and Queen Medb should be there.   
   
**Rama:**   
Karna and Scáthach are no longer with us. However, we do have our Master...Fujimaru.   
   
**Rama:**   
If we concentrate our power, we can defeat them!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you forcing yourself?   
   
**Rama:**   
Gah. No, uh...Well, how can I say this...  
   
**Rama:**   
...To be honest, I don't know if we can win. The difference in power is overwhelming.   
   
**Rama:**   
Yet I feel as though we can. I had the same feeling when I faced the Demon King Ravana.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You don't have to force yourself.   
   
**Rama:**   
Hah, I know. I'm not forcing myself.   
   
**Rama:**   
I'm still far from my limit&ndash;Even if I reach it, I feel as though I can go further.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Rama:**   
Hey, Master.   
   
**Rama:**   
I feel love for you. Mash and Nightingale, too.   
   
**Rama:**   
I love these soldiers, who follow my orders despite my young appearance.   
   
**Rama:**   
And I love Sita from the bottom of my heart,as she entrusted me with her life.   
   
**Rama:**   
Love makes me want to protect,and love makes me not submit to fear.   
   
**Rama:**   
Isn't it simple?   
   
**Rama:**   
However, when you think about it&ndash;a hero begins his journey from tiny feelings of that sort.   
   
**Rama:**   
This is something I came to understand,after returning to my youth.   
   
**Rama:**   
&ndash;Now, let's go!   
   
## Section 21: North American Myth War (Ending)   
   
**Medb:**   
They'll be here soon, my king. How's your body?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
The restoration is complete. It'd be a bit troublesome if Arjuna betrayed us, though&ndash;  
   
**Medb:**   
If the need arises, we could always use “that. ”  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...That's not necessary. I am enough.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Throw everything at the northern front. That'll end the war, and this world.   
   
**Medb:**   
&ndash;Right. Oh dear, I guess this is the end of playing queen.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Having fun?   
   
**Medb:**   
Yes, very much so. That's why I intend to enjoy it to the very end.   
   
**Medb:**   
You aren't having fun, are you, Cú?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I don't know. You can have fun on your own.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
All I need to do is continue being the king you wished for. No matter what happens.   
   
**Medb:**   
...Yeah. I love you, Cú.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Is that so?   
   
**Medb:**   
Now, let's begin the final battle.   
   
**Medb:**   
They'll struggle, and writhe, and try to stand up. All those who glare at us with determination in their eyes.   
   
**Medb:**   
We'll crush them under our heels easily. &ndash;Ahh, I'm so excited!   
   
**Rama:**   
We're here...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes! Master, we're just one step away!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The northern front is fighting well. At this rate, we should somehow&ndash;  
   
**Medb:**   
&ndash;So you've come.   
   
**Medb:**   
Oh dear, I guess those Shadow Servants really weren't good enough.   
   
**Rama:**   
You're&ndash;  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Medb. The queen who brings Celtic heroes into this world.   
   
**Mash:**   
So you're...  
   
**Medb:**   
Your scrap soldiers, or my cute boys&ndash;I wonder which are stronger?   
   
**Rama:**   
Sorry, but we don't have time for idle chit chat. We'll be taking you down now.   
   
**Medb:**   
I've already calculated it. Your power, my power,my summoned warriors' power, my monsters' power...  
   
**Medb:**   
...I'll make sure to win. After all, the one that the king trusted with everything was me, the queen!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I've confirmed enemy signatures. Analyzing the magical energy wavelengths&mdash;this is...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A massive dragonkin! Also&ndash;Chimeras,and even Shadow Servants!?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sheesh, she's really going all out!   
   
**Mash:**   
It's okay. We won't lose to enemies like that after all we've been through!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, let's go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Medb:**   
I guess that wasn't enough to stop you.   
   
**Medb:**   
...But I can't afford to lose. Come, Spriggan!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even more of them!? Can Queen Medb really create an infinite number of soldiers!?   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nightingale:**   
I would hesitate to call it infinite.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
It may be infinite given enough time, but we're defeating them faster than they're being created.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You could say that we're cornering her, both in Magecraft and science.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
However&ndash;  
   
**Medb:**   
&ndash;H-Haha. Hahahahaha!   
   
**Medb:**   
...Cornered? ME? Opposite. It's the opposite.   
   
**Medb:**   
I'm the one cornering you. Come visit the White House.   
   
**Rama:**   
Tch...She's staying out of range. So she knows that “Brahmastra” is a throwing weapon.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Let's go, everyone...Although we may not make it in time.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Make it in time?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
For what?   
  
---  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
...I don't know, but it seems like they're hiding a secret weapon.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Her smile wasn't because this is too easy for her,nor was it an attempt to mock us.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That was the smile of a predator.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
It was an unbearably sadistic smile, made right when she destroys something dear to us.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
But it's not towards us. If it was, she would have used the trump card immediately.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
In that case&ndash;  
   
**Rama:**   
Yes, I understand what you're trying to say, Nightingale. However, we must still pursue her.   
   
**Rama:**   
Now, we head to the White House!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Beowulf:**   
...Ugh!   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
&ndash;This is “Stalking Tiger,” a Bajiquan technique. Kung Fu that's been refined through thousands of years.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Like how mere fistfighting evolved into boxing,we developed fights to the death into techniques.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...This nation is the same. It's not something you should stick your hands into.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Heh...Seriously...Dammit, hitting that big Grendel was a lot easier.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Parrying incoming attacks is part of the technique. Try learning some boxing skills before your next summon.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
...Hah...Sorry, but I refuse.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Thinking in the middle of a fistfight is like trying to wake yourself from a dream. Isn't it?   
   
**Edison:**   
Okay! That should do it...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Mr. Edison...You should hurry and send the troops back.   
   
**Edison:**   
Hm?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Just have them retreat! Hurry!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
What, retreat?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hey, we're winning. What's this all of a sudden?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Who knows. You'd probably have to ask Edison to find&ndash;  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Wh-What!?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Aughhhhhhh!   
   
**Edison:**   
C-Calm down! It's just an earthquake, settle down!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
No, this is no mere earthquake! Augh!   
   
**Edison:**   
Blavatsky?   
   
**Mash:**   
Master. The White House...It's transformed...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wh-What the hell is this!? Are you telling me that this is truly the White House!?   
   
**Rama:**   
...Hm. Such extremely poor taste. The original White House was far more beautiful.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;Hey.   
   
**Rama:**   
...Cú Chulainn!   
   
**Mash:**   
Queen Medb!   
   
**Medb:**   
Hey, Demi-Servant. Don't utter my name so casually.   
   
**Medb:**   
I'm in a bad mood, mind if I kill you?   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Leave this place. Your wickedness is no illness. You were born with it.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I'd say you're in good health. Although you're still wicked.   
   
**Medb:**   
What?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Stand back, Medb. She's got business with me.   
   
**Medb:**   
What are you going to do to Cú?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That goes without saying. I'm a nurse. A nurse must fulfill her duty.   
   
**Medb:**   
Huh? With Cú? As a nurse?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
In other words, I intend to treat him.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...What a simplistic reason. However, as my enemy, I intend to kill you.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
An enemy is an enemy, even if they're a nurse. It's simple.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Feel free to do as you please. I'll treat you, and you'll kill me.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
While contradictory, that's how we should be. One thing to say before combat.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
What?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You are ill. I recommend suicide, or allowing yourself to be defeated.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I'm not really one to talk, but you're pretty crazy, aren't you? What you're saying is pretty ridiculous.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;You can't feel joy.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Say that again?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
No, that's not quite right. It's not that you can't, it's that you don't.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Becoming king didn't stop you from feeling joy. It only sealed your joy away.   
   
**Medb:**   
...Shut your mouth, nurse.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You've trapped yourself in a cage, ceding your body to a “system” called a “king. ”  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Since you feel no joy, you fight automatically and mechanically. If you don't do so, you can't continue being king.   
   
**Medb:**   
Didn't I tell you to shut up!?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
You talk like you've seen it for yourself. Did we have some sort of connection in our past life?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
No, I haven't seen it myself. I simply know, because that's how I used to be.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I cast aside my own humanity,working only to fulfill my goal.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I had to pay a price for that,but I didn't mind.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I was fine being nothing more than a healing machine.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Of course, I can't deny that it's a twisted way of life. Nothing changed from when I was alive, working tenaciously at patient's bedside.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
But still, I didn't mind. I simply wanted to help expand to the world, with an iron body and an iron will.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
The hope for medical treatment. The delight of recovery. These things were needed in the world at the time.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
For that, I abandoned everything I had, but I have no regrets!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;So let me ask, king of savages. Is your rule truly necessary?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
What prospects for the future do you have? Where do you aim to be, after all is done?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Who knows.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You have nothing. Your deeds are like severe burns. That's why&ndash;you and I are different.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
My blood boils, for the sake of dreams. Your blood has grown thick and cold, for the sake of ambition.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That is your illness. Allow me to treat you, Cú Chulainn.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Even if I die, I must treat you.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...You done talking? Your lecture was so crazy that I actually couldn't help but listen.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Ill. Ill. Illness, huh? I see, I get it. Pretty fitting. I was used to things like curses and wounds, but&mdash;  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I'd never actually suffered from illness before. This what you'd call “seeing the light,” iron woman.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
That must mean this overbearing sense of fatigue is an illness.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
If this body is healed, and this blood is purified, I might return to my senses.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;But that's not possible. I think you're well aware of that.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
You know, in this world there are incurable diseases that you can never recover from, right?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Well then. Here I go!   
   
**Medb:**   
...Let's go, Cú!   
   
**Medb:**   
I'm Medb, queen of Connacht. I won't lose to people like you!   
   
**Rama:**   
I am Rama, king of Kosala. This task was handed down to me, by those who have fallen.   
   
**Rama:**   
So long as you threaten to destroy this world&ndash;my fighting spirit, my will shall never falter.   
   
**Rama:**   
In the name of my wife Sita,I swear by the name of the god I hold faith in.   
   
**Rama:**   
I shall smite thee as an iron hammer. Prepare yourself, Queen Medb!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Rama:**   
&ndash;Right there! “Brahmastra! ”  
   
**Mash:**   
...We did it...  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...  
   
**Medb:**   
Uh&ndash;Ugh&ndash;  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Tch. You're in pretty bad shape, Medb.   
   
**Medb:**   
Yes, Cú. I feel like I could die at any moment. But I fulfilled my role...  
   
**Medb:**   
I really, really did it.... Will you praise me?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&mdash;Yeah. You did pretty well.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
You defended your nation, as queen. You're a pretty capable woman, when you try.   
   
**Medb:**   
...I'm glad. That's all I wanted to hear.   
   
**Medb:**   
That was enough to save me. My wish came true.   
   
**Medb:**   
You've finally&ndash;become mine.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's this “role? ”  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What did you do?   
  
---  
  
   
**Medb:**   
Ahahahaha! Ahahahaha! Don't you know my name?   
   
**Medb:**   
I'm Medb! Queen Medb! Don't you know of my greatest work, from my legend?   
   
**Medb:**   
The “Clan Calatin! ” A group of warriors to defeat the peerless hero, Cú Chulainn!   
   
**Rama:**   
So that's your trump card? Very well then, summon them!   
   
**Medb:**   
...Ahaha...That's wrong, so wrong. It's completely different from what you imagine!   
   
**Medb:**   
Completely, and totally wrong!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
......  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Wait. Is that possible? Should it even be possible!?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A Heroic Spirit can't possibly come up with something that terrifying! I mean, is it even possible through Magecraft!?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Queen Medb! This is something not even Solomon dared try!   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor!? Doctor, what exactly is happening!?   
   
**Mash:**   
There's nothing strange here&mdash;  
   
**Nightingale:**   
The North Army!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's right! THAT was summoned on them just now!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't tell me that's...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A Demon God Pillar?   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I've confirmed 28 Demon God Pillars at the northern front!   
   
**Mash:**   
...What?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
To summon an entire pack of Demon God Pillars by shoving them into the framework of “Clan Calatin! ”  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's theoretically possible for a wielder of the Holy Grail. It's definitely possible...But a total of 28 of them!?   
   
**Rama:**   
Is that really possible!?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Her wish must have been that powerful. More so than any other to date.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;If it was for that man. She would offer any sacrifice. Even her own life.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, the Servants on the northern front!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...What is this!?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That's, you know...A major boss.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Why would something like that appear here!? Is our [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] okay!?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...We've received a transmission. It seems they're fine.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
In other words, the enemy sent these here to crush us instead!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...  
   
**Beowulf:**   
...There's no way to win. It's a whole group of Demon God Pillars.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
They aren't something that mere Servants can handle. However, escaping is impossible, too.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Well, this just means we've got to give up. Li Shuwen, they'd be too much even for you.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...As I'd expect.   
   
**Edison:**   
...This is the end.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Edison?   
   
**Edison:**   
There's no way to win against this! Look, just look!   
   
**Edison:**   
There's 28 of them!   
   
**Edison:**   
Even a single one would require multiple Servants to defeat!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Edison! Calm yourself! You mustn't panic!   
   
**Edison:**   
It seems...Justice is defeated...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
......Hey, lion head.   
   
**Edison:**   
...Lion head? Lion...There's no lion here...Oh, you must mean me! Wh-What is it, horned lady?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Well you see&mdash;Quit your whining!   
   
**Edison:**   
Aah, my ear!?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
It's true that we're in a pinch, in trouble, in a catastrophe! But that [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] trusted us to do this!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
If we can hold out here, we win! If we give up now, the front will collapse, right!?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
That's right, but these things are on a different level. Would our attacks even be effective?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Even if they aren't effective, it's fine if we just survive! I don't care what anyone says, I won't lose!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
No, I can't stand losing to them! They killed my rival...They killed my friend Nero!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Sure, that's fine, but...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hey you&ndash; Get out of the way!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Aaaaah!?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Above you! You've got to look above you! And wipe those tears.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...I-I know that! Let's pull ourselves together and fight, Greenie!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
I've got a name, learn it already! ...So, Old Man Edison?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
What will you do? You can try to run, if you want.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
We can still buy time, if you go now.   
   
**Edison:**   
......  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Now, bring it on! Clan Calatin!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I, Elisabeth Báthory&ndash;will send you to your death with my hit song!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...You leaving now?   
   
**Medb:**   
Yes, I am. I entrust the Grail to you.   
   
**Medb:**   
Farewell, Cú Chulainn. May we meet again sometime, somewhere&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
...Cú Chulainn. Are you&ndash;  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;I've always been one to take the long road. I never had much luck with good women. It never lasted.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
But all the bad women flock to me. Medb was especially tenacious, more so than briar vines...  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Sheesh. The moment she becomes good, she disappears looking satisfied.   
   
**Rama:**   
He seems a little different?   
   
**Mash:**   
...He's more like when we met in Fuyuki...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Just slightly, but the magical energy surrounding him has weakened.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The era's ability to correct itself probably strengthened, because the one who wished Cú Chulainn into kingship vanished.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's basically like a 0% chance became 3%...But now there's a possibility!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Listen, you have to defeat Cú Chulainn, before the northern front collapses! That's the last chance to repair this era!   
   
## Section 22: Shielder, Master, Soldier, Nurse   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;Okay. Then let's get the killing started.   
   
**Rama:**   
Mad King.... Do you intend to hand over the Grail?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Not at all. That was my geis. While Medb may have been a helplessly wicked woman&ndash;  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
She used a wish granter with the power to dominate an era without hesitation to seize just the heart of one man...Me.   
   
**　:**   
&ndash;Very well, this is my wish: To make Cú Chulainn king. A wicked king, enough to rival even me.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
For her, I may have been a toy to discard when she got tired of me, but I should admire her spirit at least.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
That's why I've abandoned all joy, and continue to fight. Now, and forever.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Besides, all of you&mdash;  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
You've gotten in my way so many times until now. Do you think I'd just let you live?   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Come, brats. What happens when you pick fights with an Ulster warrior&mdash;  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I'll teach you by tearing your bodies to pieces, and crushing your very bones!   
   
**Rama:**   
Mash! Master! This is the final battle! Don't back down now! If you let down your guard for even a moment, we'll die!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Fou! Fou!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Let's go! Master, bring us victory!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
His form...changed!?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It seems the Holy Grail's wish is still driving him. “A better king”&ndash;in his case, “stronger. ”  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He's going to attack with even more strength than before! Be careful!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Hah ...Hah ...Hah!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
&ndash;Oh tree of mourning, sharpen your fangs! “Yew Bow! ”  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Oh man, this isn't good. It's not working at all!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Manager, give me some water! My throat's all dry!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...By manager, you mean me!? That being said, I do have water!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I won't lose!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...Edison, Mr. Edison. You already know, don't you?   
   
**Edison:**   
...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Stand up. Stand, and fight.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Aren't you an American? Aren't you a pioneer who traded the sword for an axe and gun?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
While you believe in the occult,you refused to rely on such powers.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
That aspect of you was why I shared a friendship with you&ndash;  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
That's why everyone followed you. To reject the unknown and dream of the future. That was your greatest merit.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Now, you must&ndash;  
   
**Edison:**   
......  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Ah, oh no!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hey, lady!?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...???  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? I'm fine?   
   
**Edison:**   
&ndash;How difficult it truly is to stand up and fight.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
That's right. It is difficult.   
   
**Edison:**   
But one is a hero because one treads past countless despair.   
   
**Edison:**   
If I keep forcing such burdens upon such a little lady...I'd be a disgrace to America!   
   
**Edison:**   
Hahahaha! I'll show you the heroic figure of the true King of Inventions! “World Faith Domination! ”  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...Amazing!   
   
**Edison:**   
I know, right?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
With that, my live concert can shine brighter than usual! All glittery! And sparkly! And dragony!   
   
**Edison:**   
...I never assumed it would be used like that...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Edison has now stood up as well.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
But...Even if all five of us fight,I don't know how many more minutes we can last.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...If only there was something else...Something that would give us an edge...  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Mash:**   
His form...Again!   
   
**Rama:**   
We should be wearing him down,but it doesn't feel like that at all!   
   
**Rama:**   
As expected of the Child of Light. He might just be the strongest Lancer in the world!   
   
**Rama:**   
Still&ndash;we cannot lose.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Y-You need to hurry! The northern front won't hold much longer!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Just a reminder. If they lose, America loses! At that point, it's highly likely this era will collapse!   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood, Doctor...But...But!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
&ndash;Not enough. This still isn't enough to defeat me!   
   
**Rama:**   
We need to do it! Master, please give us your orders!   
   
**Rama:**   
We need to trust the guys at the northern front!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Got it!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Full speed ahead!   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Gah!?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
You need healing...Augh!   
   
**Edison:**   
Robin Hood! Blavatsky!   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Guh...Something of this size is difficult to knock chi into...  
   
**Edison:**   
No one can go on...I must at least evacuate everyone else&ndash;  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What would be the point in that, you idiot!? I-I can...still fight!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Guh...  
   
**Edison:**   
No, you mustn't move......You can't fight anymore...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Desertion...Treason...Back talk! Those are the things I hate the most...So...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
I can...Still fight!   
   
**Edison:**   
...Then I have no choice!   
   
**Edison:**   
Blavatsky! Take care of them!   
   
**Edison:**   
Noble Phantasm overload&ndash;“World Faith Domination! ”  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Wait...Self-destruction!?   
   
**Edison:**   
Don't stop me! This is the only thing I can think of now!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Hey, stop it, Old Man Edison!   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I admire your courage,but you might not even last one minute!   
   
**Edison:**   
I don't care!   
   
**Edison:**   
I have a duty to protect you&ndash;everyone, for a little while longer!   
   
**Edison:**   
Not as the Presi-king of America! Not as King of Inventions! Not even as Thomas Alva Edison!   
   
**Edison:**   
But because I am human!   
   
**Edison:**   
I have a duty as a human who, in the distant future, will exploit this land and inhabit this nation!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Edison...You mustn't...  
   
**Edison:**   
Farewell, my friends. Trust in Fujimaru.   
   
**Edison:**   
I'm sure [♂ he /♀ she] will surely lead you to victory&ndash;  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Edison!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...  
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...Huh...  
   
**Edison:**   
...What...  
   
**H：???:**  
&ndash;Hahahahaha! How unsightly! How unsightly of you, Edison!   
   
**H：???:**  
You're ordinary after all, unfit to stand before me! Hang your head in shame, and begone immediately!   
   
**Edison:**   
...This...This disgusting voice...And this pointless laugh...  
   
**Edison:**   
D-Don't tell me...You're...  
   
**H：???:**  
I'll tell you! I am the true genius, the one given the duty of pioneering the stars, I am&mdash;  
   
**Edison:**   
Hysteric! It's you, Mr. Hysteric&mdash;!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I'm Nikola Tesla!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
You're kidding! Nikola Tesla!?   
   
**Edison:**   
Guh, nnnnn! To appear at a time like this, as always...  
   
**Edison:**   
What a man with good timing you are! And you say that you of all people, intend to help me!?   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
You must be joking! Even if I was summoned a thousand times, I would never help you!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I intend to save this era&ndash;And those whom I owe a debt to.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I caused them a bit of trouble in England, after all.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
That relic from the Age of Gods is destined to disappear, due to the power of electricity I paved the path to.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Edison. Just stand aside and witness the beauty of my grand lightning!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!   
   
**Edison:**   
Mmph, that laugh sounds like he's been practicing it every morning in front of a mirror! Such meticulous planning, fit for a genius!   
   
**Edison:**   
But don't mess with me, Tesla! In the end, you're nothing more than an eccentric that stood out!   
   
**Edison:**   
A true genius is universal! You're not one to talk! You couldn't even find a wife! You stayed single your whole life!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
&ndash;Fool. That just means no woman was able to match me. Genius begets a solitary life. You really are an ordinary man.   
   
**Edison:**   
I'm not ordinary! I'm a CEO! I'm tired of seeing geniuses! People like Bell!   
   
**Edison:**   
A CEO must use geniuses well! You don't even understand that!? Fool! You fool!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...Hey. Old Man Edison. Isn't he being really childish right now!?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
&ndash;Yes, yes. Okay, geniuses. It's about time to start dealing with reality.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Even the power of electricity can't defeat these monsters.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
...Hmph. I wasn't summoned by that strange man to defeat those things.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
That Master is the one fighting, correct? Then, I simply have to keep these monsters sealed away.   
   
**Edison:**   
...An electrical cage.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Hah. I suppose even an ordinary man would realize it if I gave away these many hints.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Now, out of the way! “System Keraunos! ”  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Feel the power of the thunder and lightning of a new legend!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
What!? Maybe I held back too much!   
   
**Edison:**   
&ndash;Hah!   
   
**Edison:**   
You always choke at the very end. That's why people never write decent biographies about you.   
   
**Edison:**   
By the way, my biography is distributed globally.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Why you!   
   
**Edison:**   
This is true electricity, true thunder!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
...Tch.   
   
**Edison:**   
...Tch.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Fine, we must work together. Of course, since I have the higher power output. Sync with me.   
   
**Edison:**   
That much I agree with. All right then. I'll overload it a bit and continuously hit those eerie monsters&ndash;  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Yes. We'll hit them with enough lightning to keep killing an immortal monster until the end of time.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
...Here goes!   
   
**Edison:**   
&ndash;Got it. Noble Phantasm&ndash;activate!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Thunder and lighting, descend!   
   
**Edison:**   
Bring light to this world that has plunged into darkness!   
   
**Both:**   
&ndash;“World Faith Domination! ”&ndash;“System Keraunos! ”  
   
**Edison:**   
So, what do we do now?   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I just told you! Our only duty is to keep those things sealed away!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I hate to admit it, but even among ancient relics that should vanish one day, some items have their uses.   
   
**Edison:**   
That's...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
I'm observing an enormous amount of Ether!   
   
**Edison:**   
What!? What exactly is happening&ndash;  
   
**E：???:**  
&ndash;Expanding sacred domain. Domain secured. Setting divine punishment enforcement limits. Calculating amount of time needed for magical energy convergence and acceleration.   
   
**E：???:**  
&ndash;Countdown.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
It's Arjuna!   
   
**Arjuna:**   
Please evacuate at once, if you could. I'll try to keep the range as small as possible, but&ndash;  
   
**Arjuna:**   
I will sacrifice myself with this attack, after all. I won't be holding back.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...A weapon...From the Age of Gods...A Divine Construct?   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
G-Get away! We'll be consumed by it too!   
   
**Arjuna:**   
By the rage of Shiva, your life ends here. “Pashupata”&ndash; Take this!   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...You're kidding...He did it?   
   
**Arjuna:**   
I hope this is&ndash;enough to atone for my actions.   
   
**Arjuna:**   
Karna...How you felt...Now I...finally...  
   
**Edison:**   
We won...  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
It would seem so...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
We really did it, Robin!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...Although I've got mixed feelings, as a fellow Archer. Man, it's a big world out there.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...Now that I've finished my duty here,I must hurry and attend to my other business.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Pardon me.   
   
**Edison:**   
Hahaha!   
   
**Edison:**   
His Noble Phantasm may have dealt the finishing blow, but it was MY electrical skills that contained those giants!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Cease your delusions, Edison. You were simply backup. Mere support.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
It was Nikola Tesla's electricity that sealed those monsters. If I had full power, I could've blown up the whole continent!   
   
**Edison:**   
...Hmm, I could argue about that if I wanted to, but...I'm in an extremely good mood right now.   
   
**Edison:**   
I'll just leave it at that. Period, times infinity.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
What?   
   
**Edison:**   
...What? Do you want to fight?   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
&ndash;Of course not. I wouldn't lend an ear to the jokes of an ordinary man&ndash;  
   
**Edison:**   
Oops, my hand slipped.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Oops, my electricity slipped.   
   
**Edison:**   
...  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Um, they've started fighting.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Just leave them. The war's over. They're free to hurt each other however they want.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...Even the articles of William Hearst wouldn't contain such absurd spectacles.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
&ndash;Heh, but those two are both heading down the proper path...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
That path just happens to be narrow,so they always end up fighting each other.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
In the past, those who wished to see happiness for others were forced to take up the sword.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
If they didn't rule through violence, no one would know happiness.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...But those two were different. They fought not with swords, but with their intellect.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
In other words, they're proof that humanity slowly progressed&ndash;the fruit of history itself.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Do you understand that, Beowulf? Your side never had a chance of victory from the very start.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
They've brought happiness and fortune to far more people...than your side ever could.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
...So it's not an era of strength anymore, huh? How sad.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Perhaps so. To move forward and make progress, something must be lost.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Brilliant tales of heroes vanish,and what's left is mostly bland and uninteresting&ndash;  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
But these scholars and eccentrics share the same passion of “making a nameless someone happy” and work their hardest to achieve that.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
...I see. But for now, you still need some strength like mine, right?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
That's right. Farewell, Beowulf.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Hope you're summoned by Fujimaru next time.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Hahahahaha! Sounds great, that may give me more fun than I had this time!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Y-You, you did it&ndash;! Everyone, we won!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The “Clan Calatin” at the northern front has completely vanished!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And Cú Chulainn's finished as well!   
   
**Mash:**   
Confirmed Spirit Origin collapse! Heroic Spirit Cú Chulainn's materialization is fading!   
   
**Rama:**   
This is the end, Cú Chulainn!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Tch. Geez, looks like I've lost my touch...  
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
...Well. This is the end of the Mad King Cú Chulainn's role.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
However&ndash;before I'm done, I've got to summon the Demon God guarding the Holy Grail.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Good luck, brats.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
O Holy Grail. The ultimate vessel to make wishes come true.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Manifest. Remember. You have joined the 72 Demon Gods!   
   
**Rama:**   
There's still more!? Ugh, my Noble Phantasm's has just about run out.   
   
**Rama:**   
Cú Chulainn...is far too powerful!   
   
**Mash:**   
No way...We're already at the limit of our power! We can't keep fighting consecutive battles like this&mdash;  
   
**Nightingale:**   
I shall sever all that is poisonous,and all that is harmful&ndash;Nightingale Pledge!   
   
**Rama:**   
My wounds!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;Master, now is the time to save lives. I shall treat your wounds. Everything will be as it was before.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Over, and over, as many times as it takes. To crush the outrageous, to overcome despair.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
For that, I offer everything I have.   
   
**Mash:**   
Nightingale!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
One of the 72 Demon God Pillars...Rank number 38. The Demon of War, Halphas.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
War will never vanish from this world. Weapons will never disappear from this world.   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
Mortals are fated to continue fighting,turning like screws in an endless cycle.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;No! No! I deny it! I shall shout it tens of thousands of times!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
When the lives saved outnumber those lost,the spiral of conflict should eventually cease turning!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
No, I'll MAKE it cease. That is my task, as a Servant.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
So begone from this world, Demon God. I shall never give up, even if it means a thousand deaths!   
   
**Cú Chulainn Alter:**   
I am the one who bestows conflict. You who wish for peace in your hearts...You are unnecessary!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Holy Grail recovery...Mission complete! But...There were too many sacrifices...  
   
**Rama:**   
What are you saying? We're Servants. We were summoned to fight, and destined to fight for salvation.   
   
**Rama:**   
This battle was on an epochal scale.   
   
**Rama:**   
Some might regret that they never finish the fight, but none of them run away from it.   
   
**Rama:**   
See them off with a smile.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Sigh, I'm tired! France, then Rome, and now America!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Sheesh, you should know when to stop calling for encores.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
You've already been summoned three times!? Why? Is there some sort of demand for virgin girls?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
W-Wh-Who are you calling a virgin!? If you say it again, I'll hit you with my mic, you pervert!   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yeah, yeah. Still, I'd say our Master's pretty good.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
This is the fifth one, right? How many hells have they ventured into...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Yes, although they're still far from my ideal Master&ndash;  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
But I quite like their spirit,constantly reaching for the stars!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Anyway, Robin. I'll be going first.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
Yeah, take care. Sigh, I wonder if I'll be called again.   
   
**Robin Hood:**   
...Maybe I should study up on effective traps,for every era and location.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Mr. Edison. The world was saved, isn't that wonderful?   
   
**Edison:**   
Yes...That's right, this was for the best.   
   
**Edison:**   
We are “e pluribus unum. ”Even America cannot stand alone.   
   
**Edison:**   
I gave in to despair, and thought only of this nation...That was my first blunder.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...I think that's fine.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
In the end, it's because you fought back that you were able to keep this nation safe before they arrived.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
There might be countless mistakes during the process, but finding the correct answer from those is what Edison does best, right?   
   
**Edison:**   
...That's right.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
&ndash;Hah. Just like an ordinary man of action.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
You encounter needless troubles because you rush blindly into challenges without understanding the theories.   
   
**Edison:**   
...What, you mean empty theories? Like those of a certain someone.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Huh?   
   
**Edison:**   
What?   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
You two could at least try to get along when it's time to depart...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...It's about time. Mr. Edison, I'm glad I was able to fight alongside you.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
Mr. Tesla, I recognize you're a genius,but you should learn to fit in with others.   
   
**Blavatsky:**   
...I say that, but I suppose you're a genius because you didn't learn to fit in...  
   
**Blavatsky:**   
It seems difficult to be a genius.   
   
**Edison:**   
&ndash;Good grief. To think I'd join forces with you of all people to save this nation.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
There are things unthinkable in our lifetimes. That's just what it means to be a Servant, Mr. Ordinary.   
   
**Edison:**   
&ndash;Hah. I will be summoned again, and this time&ndash;I will fight for [♂ his /♀ her] sake.   
   
**Edison:**   
This time as a proper Servant...along with Karna and Blavatsky.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
...Hmph. This is as irritating as static electricity. To think my conclusions are the same as an ordinary man's.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Yes&mdash;but it's the truth. If opportunity arises, this thunder god shall fight for humanity. Though...  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I'll have no issues if I'm summoned first,but that is something that depends on luck...  
   
**Mash:**   
Nightingale!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Yes?   
   
**Mash:**   
When I was about to fall to my knees,your voice helped me stand again.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Thank you very much!   
   
**Nightingale:**   
There's no need to thank me. That's how our agreement was originally, anyway.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
&ndash;It seems the treatment is complete. We healed the injuries of an entire nation, not just an individual.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, thanks to you.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thank you.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nightingale:**   
While gratitude is unnecessary, I'll accept it respectfully. However, in exchange...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Please, allow me to shake your hand, [♂ Mr. /♀ Ms. ] Fujimaru.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
My secret pleasure was to shake a patient's hand like this when they were discharged from hospital.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course, gladly.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Don't worry, I'll adjust my strength accordingly. Anyway, stay healthy, my Master.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You have a rather cute side.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Cute isn't quite the right expression. Joy of this sort is just good etiquette as a nurse.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
...Good grief. To think you're still well enough to make such a bad joke. It seems I've underestimated you, Master.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry to interrupt a good scene. With the Holy Grail's recovery, the era correction will begin soon!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Preparations for the Rayshift are complete. It's time to part ways.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This time...there were far too many Servants who had to die for us to get to this point.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
While I know parting is sad and painful, you still emerged victorious.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You can return with pride. That's the greatest respect you can pay them.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes...Anyway, Nightingale,we'll be going now&mdash;  
   
**Nightingale:**   
Miss Mash. Before that, may I have a word?   
   
**Nightingale:**   
My wish is to eliminate hospitals from the world.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That is, adequate medical care being available in every home.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I didn't think that, even after 100 years, it wouldn't have been achieved...  
   
**Nightingale:**   
But there's one thing I still believe in. That someday, illness will be eradicated completely.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
No more patients will die filled with despair and resentment.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
I'll no longer have to oversee the final agonizing moments of soldiers that have respected me.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
That's why I fought. Both now, and forever into the future.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
There's no reason for you to feel any guilt. I did this for my own goals.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
You too must continue to live...for yours.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Thank you very much, Chief Nurse.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Miss Mash. Dreams and wishes are different things.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
My wish isn't my dream. The moment people classify something as a dream, they misunderstand it as something far away.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Constantly facing reality, understanding the numbers, and fighting thoroughly is what opens a path to one's wishes.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Sobbing must be trampled, resignation must be crushed. &ndash;That is the one and only path that humans can walk.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Master. I have as much trust in you as my kindred spirit, Sidney Herbert.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Please, continue to support Miss Mash. May there always be light along your path.   
   
**Nightingale:**   
Farewell. I look forward to the day we meet again.   
   
**Mash:**   
...The path to one's wishes...is opened by fighting...  
   
**Rama:**   
Ahem, it seems I'm the last. Mash, Master...  
   
**Rama:**   
My wish has not been fulfilled yet, but still...I'm proud of many things that happened during this battle.   
   
**Rama:**   
I was able to rescue Sita. In record time, no less.   
   
**Rama:**   
But above all, I was able to meet you. I find this bond as precious as Sita and my younger brother Lakshmana.   
   
**Rama:**   
If I could become your Servant once again,that would bring me the greatest joy possible.   
   
**Rama:**   
Thus, this is the only thing I have to say. &ndash;May we meet again!   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. See you again!   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...So it was no good.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...No, that's not true.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
...I'm quite surprised.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Taking a lethal wound and still surviving is how a Servant is, and how I am.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
All that means is some of the skills I've acquired over my long life have proven useful.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Still, Cú Chulainn really was the strongest. Even though their timing was impeccable...To think they could actually defeat him...  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I should say I'm impressed.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Now then, that leaves just one more promise&ndash;  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Very well, I'll fulfill my agreement. Although, now with the Holy Grail's power gone, this world is correcting itself.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
There's time for a single round at most&ndash;  
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I don't mind. After fighting with Beowulf,I think a single strike is my limit now.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
Your proposition is convenient for me, if anything.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...I see. Although simply vanishing would be less painful, I'd imagine.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
A chance to fight the famed queen of the Land of Shadows? If I miss this chance, it'll probably be gone for eternity.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
I don't mind if it's just a single round. Scáthach, do you happen to know my nickname?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Yes. Your nickname means that you only need one strike to defeat any opponent. Something that any warrior would admire.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
“No Second Strike”&ndash; If so, I shall put everything I have behind this single strike as well.   
   
**Li Shuwen:**   
&ndash;Heh. I'd want no less.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
&ndash;Very well.   
   
**Both:**   
An honest&ndash;  
   
**Both:**   
Match!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&ndash;Hey, you managed to pull through again, somehow.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This means the United States of America, a nation essential to history, was successfully established.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In any case, good work. We'll secure the Holy Grail that you recovered.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Both of you should go back to your rooms and get some rest. I'll tell you about the next plan later.   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood, Doctor. Let's get going to our rooms, Senpai.   
   
**Mash:**   
May I ask something? Many sad things happened on this journey, as always.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's why it might be a little&ndash;inappropriate, to say something like this.   
   
**Mash:**   
But...I'm having fun.   
   
**Mash:**   
Travelling to different parts of the world and eras with you. We meet many people and heroes.   
   
**Mash:**   
This time, we went to America, and got to meet regional heroes like Geronimo and Billy...  
   
**Mash:**   
And we got to witness Nightingale's incredibly strong conviction.   
   
**Mash:**   
Putting good and bad aside&ndash;even the enemies we met with possessed vivid personalities, in their own ways.   
   
**Mash:**   
...It's amazing. I'm sure no mage could experience such a journey.   
   
**Mash:**   
Our journey will never go down in history. It'll be one engraved only within our memories.   
   
**Mash:**   
I want to cherish these memories forever and ever.... That's how I feel.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I feel the same.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's cherish them.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Anyway, I'll be going now.   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, don't lie down right away just because you're tired.   
   
**Mash:**   
You should take a shower to relax your body before going to sleep.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yup. Good night, see you tomorrow.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You did well, Mash.   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. Let's do our best next time too.   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?   
   
**Mash:**   
Sen...pai...S-Strange...I can't...stand&mdash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Mash?   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Fou, fo&mdash;u!
