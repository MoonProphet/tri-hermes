# Singularity 4: The Mist City - London  
  
## Prelude  
   
**Woman:**   
Hah...Hah...Hah...  
   
**Woman:**   
What is this fog? My body...is losing...more and more...strength...  
   
**Woman:**   
Not only that...  
   
**Woman:**   
All this time...Something's been...chasing me all this time!   
   
**E：???:**  
&mdash;I'm sorry.   
   
**Woman:**   
Huh? Wh-When did you...get in front...of me? O-Oh...  
   
**Woman:**   
...N-No...Stay away...  
   
**Woman:**   
Oooh, no, don't come near me...I don't know you...What are you...WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU!   
   
**E：???:**  
I'm sorry, Mom. I'm sorry.   
   
**E：???:**  
But I want to go home...I want to go home, go home, go home, go home, so...  
   
**E：???:**  
We...We really, really...want to go home, okay?   
   
**Woman:**   
Eek! No, please stop&mdash; Stop, stop, stop, stop!   
   
**Woman:**   
What's that thing you're holding!? Stop it...Please...Just don't come...near me!   
   
**E：???:**  
I'm sorry.   
  
**--SECTION BREAK--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning, Senpai.... You're looking quite pale today.   
   
**Mash:**   
You couldn't sleep at all? That's no good,you must get plenty of rest while you're in Chaldea.   
   
**Mash:**   
Rest is also an important part of our mission. Like I told you before, we are&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai?   
   
**Mash:**   
Perhaps...You had...a dream?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I had a scary dream.   
   
**Mash:**   
...So you did have a dream.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What kind of dream was it? It's just a guess, but...could it be my...Um...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The dream was like a horror movie.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't really remember.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see. That's good to hear...  
   
**Mash:**   
No. No, it's nothing. The meeting's about to start,so let's go to the Control Room.   
   
**Mash:**   
You've had breakfast already, right? Then let's go, the Doctor is waiting.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good morning, everybody. Good timing. We just finished prepping.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's start with the analysis of information from last time.   
   
**Mash:**   
Observing the era of King Solomon, where a summoning spell called the 72 Demon Gods was used, right?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's right. Let me start with the result...There was nothing wrong with King Solomon's era.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Singularities could not be observed around the 10th century BC. Basically what that means is...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Unfortunately, as Romani says, those who called themselves the 72 Demon Gods had nothing to do with King Solomon.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why is that?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, how do I put it...Think of it like a mystery novel,one where the suspect's alibi stands.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Good morning, Da Vinci.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hey, good morning! Someone that can actually greet people! Fujimaru, you're a fine Master!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If King Solomon had used the 72 Demon Gods,we definitely would have detected it.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Or at least seen signs that he released his 72 Demon Gods toward the future from 10th Century B. C.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But there was nothing unusual during King Solomon's time. Which means his era remains part of correct human history.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Therefore&mdash;  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Lev Lainur and those calling themselves Demon Gods appeared from a completely different era.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So, King Solomon has nothing to do with them. Well, of course&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
...That's not the case if King Solomon had been serving someone else as a Servant, right?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Correct. Like Fujimaru,one can simply use Solomon as a familiar in his own era.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That way, one could also control the "72 Demon Gods. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sigh. Using the 72 Demon Gods as familiars...But that's assuming those things really existed.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Besides, I don't think King Solomon is the kind of person that would aid such evil.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Even if he was so in life...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Servants obey their Masters...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Forgive me, Doctor. But it's a Servant's nature to obey their Master.   
   
**Mash:**   
As long as it's the Master's command, then King Solomon would have no choice but to obey, right?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Such a villain couldn't summon Solomon. It's not like the Holy Grail War in Fuyuki.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Chaldea's Summoning System comes into effect only if the Master and Heroic Spirit both agree to it.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, you do have a point. I came to Chaldea because I agreed to.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The director back then was a fine mage. I agreed to the contract because I could trust them.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I told you before, didn't I? I'm Chaldea's third successful summon. It's definitely worth noting!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you're Servant No. 3?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who was the first?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
No. 2 is right in front of you. It's Mash. As for No. 1, no one knows at this point.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
No. 1 and No. 2 are treated as confidential matters. Only the previous director knew the details.   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai. The Heroic Spirit who rescued me is No. 2.... Not that I know his True Name or skills.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Director Marie didn't even know about No. 1, either. The previous director kept all of No. 1's data under wraps.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Now that I think about it, perhaps the previous director's death wasn't an accident, but a murder.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's likely that Lev disliked the successful No. 1&mdash;No, the Heroic Spirit Summoning System itself, so much so that he killed the previous director.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, but I think No. 1 ended in failure. Since even Mash's Heroic Spirit No. 2 ended as an incomplete summon.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
For Chaldea, completely successful Heroic Spirit summons started with me, No. 3.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Also, No. 1's existence itself is suspicious. I think No. 1 may have been summoned by accident.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's because Fate, the Heroic Spirit Summoning System's foundation, was at long last proven with No. 2's help and&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ahem! Ms. Leonardo, we're going to start the Rayshift soon, so would you mind getting it ready?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Whoops, a slip of my tongue. Well, that's it for me♪  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Now, in any case, for the remaining four Singularities...It's possible the mastermind lurks in one of these eras.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
After all, there are no abnormalities in any other era. If we crush each Singularity, we'll find the culprit.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Now let me explain the details of our Order this time. The Fourth Singularity is in the 19th century&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Of the seven, it's the Singularity closest to modern times. But no need to be surprised.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is a time when civilizations rise and flourish. In this era, mankind makes huge strides.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&ndash;In other words, the Industrial Revolution! It's a definitive turning point in mankind's history.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even from the standpoint of a consumer society,this is when mankind makes a huge leap towards modern times.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Your specific destination will be the dazzling, lavish British Empire.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Surprisingly, it's specific to the capital, London. This differs from the widespread approach of the other Singularities.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Maybe this time, you won't have to walk yourselves to death. After all, there are carriages and trains.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That is, of course, if you can manage to use them. Since some abnormalities have been detected...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Soon, the Singularity that is 19th century London will be incinerated. It will vanish. You must stop it.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Find the Holy Grail,and correct the Fourth Singularity.   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. So we'll be working inside the city this time.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, that's right. Lucky you! London, the city of fog...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If only I could go with you all. Please get Sherlock Holmes's autograph if you see him.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor. This isn't a vacation.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
R-Right.   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, one more thing. Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm guessing it will be hard to get his autograph. I'm sorry, but please give up.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Right...Wait, Mash, you too?   
   
**Mash:**   
Excuse me?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Are you a Holmes fan, too? Isn't he the best? The world's best detective, the little gray cells!   
   
**Mash:**   
That's Hercule Poirot. He appears in books written by Agatha Christie.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh...Th-That's right. Okay. Let's get back on track.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All right, are you ready? The world hasn't been incinerated yet, so go reclaim our future!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mission...start!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's be cautious this time.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai.   
   
**Announcement A:**   
Unsummon Program, start. Spiritron Conversion, start.   
   
**Announcement A:**   
Rayshift starting in 3, 2, 1...  
   
**Announcement A:**   
All procedures cleared. Grand Order, commencing operation.   
   
## Section 1: London, The City of Demonic Fog   
   
**Mash:**   
Rayshift successful.... It seems we can't see very well in our current conditions.   
   
**Mash:**   
Fog? No, could it be smoke? It's extremely dense...  
   
**Mash:**   
In the sky...I can see the same "Circle of Light" as before. But...  
   
**Mash:**   
...with all this fog and pollution, it's obscured&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fog and smoke engulfing the sky? That's fairly common for the Industrial Revolution...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...but this doesn't look like your typical fog or smoke. I'm picking up an abnormal amount of magical energy readings.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's dense. Very dense. Really dense. No, this may be a little too dense!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's like the atmosphere is saturated with magical energy!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's poisonous to life-forms, this fog...Mash, Fujimaru, how are you feeling?   
   
**Mash:**   
There's nothing wrong with me. Probably because I'm a Demi-Servant.   
   
**Mash:**   
How about you, Senpai? You don't seem...any different than usual.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Same as always.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Good to hear. But try not to enter that dense fog if you can.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru is okay...Huh. Indeed, there are no significant vital sign changes.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm a bit surprised. I have the analysis result of that fog...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm positive it's harmful to organisms. It would threaten a normal human's life if they breathed it.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mages, monsters, Servants, and Phantasmals have innate magic resistance, so for them it's a different story...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So of course Mash is fine. But how is Fujimaru all right...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm...I wonder. Maybe it's a poison-resistance skill?   
   
**Mash:**   
Really?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It could be part of Mash's benefits, or rather,the benefits of the Heroic Spirit Mash fused with.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Maybe the Servant that fused with Mash has high poison resistance, or a strong blessing skill...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...and its protection extends to the Master. That could be why Fujimaru is safe.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm happy to be of use to Senpai,but it seems strange to call it a "skill. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, Fujimaru is human, after all. We'll call it "Poison Resistance Skill (Temporary)," then.   
   
**Mash:**   
I-I see..."Temporary," is it...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
For now. London, has turned into a city of death enveloped by a magical fog.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
How does it look around there? Do you see any victims?   
   
**Mash:**   
No, Doctor. It's completely deserted.   
   
**Mash:**   
It's currently 2: 00 p. m. , but there's not a single carriage or even a pedestrian in sight.   
   
**Mash:**   
I don't see any victims. There's just nobody here.   
   
**Mash:**   
It's like an abandoned city...  
   
**Mash:**   
Also, as far as we can see from the street, all the doors and windows of the buildings are shut tight.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
After people started falling victim to the fog,the survivors must have taken refuge indoors...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I've also detected multiple life readings in the surrounding buildings.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They're likely survivors. No doubt they're in trouble being trapped indoors.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We need to solve this problem at once.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's do what we can.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. You're right, Senpai.   
   
**Mash:**   
If we obtain and destroy the Holy Grail, the existence of this abnormal London will be corrected too.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sure that applies to all the residents who lost their lives because of this fog...  
   
**Mash:**   
...and those who are indoors, taking shelter from the fog. Everyone, basically.   
   
**Mash:**   
If Senpai and I can bring things under control here,all phenomena related to the magical fog should disappear.   
   
**Mash:**   
It'll be as if there were no damage or harm at all. So, um...You see, what I'm trying to say is...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash is trying to say: "Senpai is a nice person. " Right?   
   
**Mash:**   
......  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? Um, should I have not said that? Wait, did I say something wrong?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&mdash;Wait a minute. Vital reaction detected.   
   
**E：???:**  
...Who the hell are you guys?   
   
**Mash:**   
Ah...Umm, w-we're, uh&mdash;  
   
**E：???:**  
You're breathing in a place with that dense fog without croaking. You obviously aren't ordinary humans.   
   
**E：???:**  
So, which is it? Friend, or foe?   
   
**Mash:**   
(I could ask the same question...Doctor, is she human? Or maybe...)  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(I see, I'm also wondering the same! There's too much magical energy in the area. I can't get a clear reading. )  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(But look at that armor. She's definitely not a typical London citizen. )  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(I thought things would be easier since we're limited to a city. )  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(This has gotten quite troublesome! We have no clue who or what she is! )  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(An ordinary person who happens to have magical resistance? A mage? Or, maybe a Servant&mdash;)  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I can't tell at all! What do I do!? Argh, I'm so disorientated here!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(I've never seen this kind of fog before...Ah, help me, Magi☆Mari!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
"London's fog is worse than rumored. What am I supposed to do? "...There. )  
   
**Mash:**   
(Calm down, Doctor. The situation won't improve by consulting internet idols! )  
   
**E：???:**  
What are you sneaking around for? If you're not going to attack, well, whatever.   
   
**E：???:**  
I have nothing to do here. Sorry to bother you.   
   
**E：???:**  
The fog is dense around here. You'd better move if you value your life.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks for the warning.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'll do that.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Hmm? Yeah. Well, see you.   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
She's gone...The alley to the north...Right into the dense fog, all alone, confident.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, she left during our huddle? She's so impatient. I wonder if she's a London girl.   
   
**Mash:**   
That was a "huddle? "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It sounded like she knew what was going on. She probably knows more than us about the current situation in London.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's follow her.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Gathering data is important.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai. Let's go after her.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I was just about to say that. But then she just had to go and disappear on me.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor...Doctor Roman.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, sorry. All right, time to get moving. I'll keep careful watch!   
   
**Mash:**   
...What is that? I can hear something.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No vital reactions, but I detect multiple moving bodies! The fog still obscures magical readings, so I can't get any!   
   
**Mash:**   
The sound is approaching. It's close. Master!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Multiple targets closing in at high speed. Assume they're hostile. Break through before you're surrounded!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good judgment will be even more important here&mdash;Fujimaru, be careful!   
   
**Mash:**   
Preparing for battle. Master, your orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;We made it through. Somehow we were able to move without being surrounded.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Who knew something like that would be lurking in the fog? No wonder nobody's emerged from any buildings.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Since no doors or windows seem to be kicked in,that must mean they don't break into houses, right?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Strange. They're really quite strange.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. What bizarre enemies...No, I don't think they were living creatures.   
   
**Mash:**   
We'll call them enemy bodies for now. They're likely automata animated by magecraft.   
   
**Mash:**   
The structure of their remains seems familiar. Some parts are machinery from this era, too.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I-I see...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm sorry. I won't be able to give you any advance warning. All of my magical detection readings are in a state of chaos.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I only have motion detection at best. Hmm, this is quite concerning.   
   
**Mash:**   
I feel the same. It's just like the city itself...  
   
**Mash:**   
Fog, smoke. It's like there's a layer of mist around everything...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
At any rate, we have to act more cautiously than before. All right, let's go after that girl.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes...Senpai, let's go.   
   
## Section 2: Knight of Londinium   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Detecting multiple entities! Here they come! They're around the corner!   
   
**Mash:**   
...It's the same sound as before. Master!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's drive them away!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Hmm. It's like...a presence...What is this feeling?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The girl from earlier? Is she nearby? London girls are quite quick on their feet, aren't they.   
   
**Mash:**   
No, there are multiple readings. But they're silent...They're not puppets?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, they might be different. They move differently. But this feeling...They're definitely enemies. Here they come!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
All enemies defeated. Good work, Senpai.   
   
**Mash:**   
They don't seem to be puppets. But...I can't say for sure if they are humans, either.   
   
**Mash:**   
I believe these enemies...are a kind of...Well, homunculus.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Homunculus?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A kind of human created by magecraft, right?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. An artificial human created with magecraft.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Were you hurt?

**Mash:**   
No...I'm fine, Senpai, thank you. There's no need to worry. I carefully monitor my physical condition.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry. I'm probably a little on edge because of the unusual environment we're in.   
   
**Mash:**   
I need to learn how to adapt to any situation. I'm your Demi-Servant, after all.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm counting on you!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&mdash;Okay. I'm starting to get the hang of this.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor? Have you detected anything?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. It could be because they're mechanical,but I'm positive they're hostile. Multiple enemies approaching!   
   
**Mash:**   
Roger. Master, prepare for battle. Waiting for orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
All enemies destroyed. There are none left as far as I can see.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I can't detect anything else from here either. Okay, continue on ahead...Wait, hold on.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I've detected a single, large unit. Easy to make out. It's too large to be human!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I doubt it's a large vehicle. Mash, do you sense anything?   
   
**Mash:**   
...I can hear machinery operating. It's large!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It would have been a rather romantic story if Britain's secret service had arranged for a special vehicle...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...or if this era's Mage's Association had sent a mechanical golem to save the citizens of London.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I doubt that's the case here! It's clearly an enemy,and it's approaching you!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, be on your guard. It's probably a new type of enemy.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's fight cautiously.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash, we just have to take our chances!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Enemy contact now!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...All enemy movements have ceased.   
   
**Mash:**   
It was powerful...But what was it, exactly? A golem? A mechanical puppet?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A robot...  
   
**Mash:**   
It looks...that way...I guess you could see it that way, yes...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It was so cool!   
   
**Mash:**   
Cool? It looked like a walking tin can to me...Well,I guess the definition of cool is subjective...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's problematic that I can't detect any magical energy. Mash, are there any enemies remaining?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If any enemy parts are exposed, send me some images. I'll analyze them when I have the time.   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. I'll send the visual data after filming.   
   
**Mash:**   
Hmm...  
   
**Mash:**   
It's bizarre...This mechanical armor is corroding in some places.   
   
**Mash:**   
It seems fine for the most part, but areas that seem to be made of metal have...corroded...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm, did we use any acid attacks in the last battle? Wait, do we have any Servants of that sort?   
   
**Mash:**   
During the Industrial Revolution in London, massive amounts of smoke emitted from steam engines was a big social problem.   
   
**Mash:**   
The sulfurous gases in the smoke got caught in the cold fog, retaining and concentrating into a fog of sulfuric acid...  
   
**Mash:**   
...Hmm.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? Is something the matter, Mash?   
   
**Mash:**   
No. Please wait..."Something like inhaling sulfuric acid? " Yes, that's it...  
   
**Mash:**   
Some records from before...Should be...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. That's right. I mean, this era&mdash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash, behind you!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hey, who are you!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
!?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Ah!   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm under attack! An ambush? I didn't sense anything!   
   
**G：???:**  
...Hey, what are you, exactly? A human? Or a mage?   
   
**G：???:**  
You're moving unhindered within the magical fog,and you seem just fine within "our fog" as well.   
   
**G：???:**  
I guess you're just like us.   
   
**Mash:**   
So you're a Servant. You're supposed to be a human from this era, though...  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Jack the Ripper.   
   
**Mash:**   
An infamous serial killer who not only killed many women in London at the end of the 19th century, but who also dismembered them...  
   
**Mash:**   
...and directly challenged Scotland Yard. The symbol of terror that swept across England, no, all of Europe, at the time.   
   
**Jack:**   
You know about us? Hmm, that pleases me...How very nice...In that case...  
   
**Jack:**   
You're aware, then, of what we'll do to you? Oh, I'm so very, very happy!   
   
**Jack:**   
I'm so...HAPPY!   
   
**Mash:**   
She's coming at us! Master, your orders!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The motion response is gone. Either they retreated or are hiding within the fog.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Right. That was a dangerous, hostile Servant.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
From the area analysis I did during the battle, a part of this fog is likely from the Noble Phantasm of that Servant.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But the fog of magical energy that covers London is something else entirely.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In short, it was a combination of the two fogs. We've got a really difficult opponent on our hands...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The fog contains such a high density of sulfuric acid that there's no way this is a normal phenomenon.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Also...And this is the most troubling aspect, Mash...  
   
**Mash:**   
I know. My memory seems to have been altered. We just fought...and yet...  
   
**Mash:**   
...the memory of my opponent is a blur.   
   
**Mash:**   
I only remember one thing. It was a Servant.   
   
**Mash:**   
The form, the name, and...There's some other memory related to it, but...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm. Seems like the effect can transcend eras. My memory is kind of vague, too.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
At this rate, the observation record may be distorted,too. What a strange Noble Phantasm it is...  
   
**Mash:**   
Speaking of bizarre&mdash;That's right. Doctor, we, um...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We were filming...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What about the giant robot from earlier?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah! That's right. We were filming. Senpai, I'm sorry...Thank you.   
   
**Mash:**   
It seems the effect on your memory is weak, Senpai. Lucky for us!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's right! Yup. Right. I received it. I received image data for a mysterious robot.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm going to proceed in analyzing these images. I wonder what it is?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It doesn't look like a golem that runs on magical energy,but it also doesn't look like a complete machine...  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, are you versed in mechanical engineering?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm no expert, but I am a member of Chaldea. Albeit as medical staff.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm, this is...Don't tell me we've just come across some lost steam engine technology.   
   
**E：???:**  
Oh, that&mdash;?   
   
**E：???:**  
It's just a clump of steel, right? We call it...  
   
**E：???:**  
&mdash;Helter Skelter.   
   
**Mash:**   
You are&ndash;  
   
**E：???:**  
I've been watching you. You destroyed one of them,which means you're probably not my enemy.   
   
**E：???:**  
Besides, you fought well, not bad. Considering you probably have no idea about the circumstances.   
   
**E：???:**  
Very nice. I rather like fools like that.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Can I ask you a question?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who are you calling a fool!?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Say what?   
   
**Mash:**   
You're right. I'm sure we're not your enemy.   
   
**Mash:**   
Please...Can you give us some information. Will you speak with us?   
   
**Mash:**   
What's happening in this foggy city?   
   
**E：???:**  
Very well. I'll talk to you.   
   
**E：???:**  
But first, let me get one thing straight. You're a Demi-Servant, aren't you?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. My name is Mash Kyrielight. And I am a Demi-Servant.   
   
**E：???:**  
And who are you?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm Fujimaru.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**E：???:**  
Mash Kyrielight and Fujimaru, huh? ...I suppose that's all right. It has nothing to do with me.   
   
**E：???:**  
I am Mordred. A Heroic Spirit. And&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
I'm a Knight of the Round Table, here to face the perils of Londinium, a city in Father's beloved Britain.   
   
## Section 3: The Demonic Fog Laughs   
   
**F：???:**  
...Oh boy, Saber. You always reveal your True Name to strangers right away.   
   
**F：???:**  
We talked about this. If you're introducing yourself, just state your class.   
   
**F：???:**  
Do you understand? Disclosing your True Name is like revealing your abilities.   
   
**F：???:**  
That's the reason we conceal our True Names during normal Holy Grail Wars.   
   
**F：???:**  
And yet you give out your True Name at the drop of a hat...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, what's the difference? This is no longer the "Holy Grail War" that you spoke of.   
   
**Mordred:**   
It's not the one with 7 Heroic Spirits, nor the one with 14. On top of that, no Masters. Anyway, do you have any ciders? I am thirsty.   
   
**F：???:**  
Wait, that's my favorite sofa...Ah well. Yes, I already got your ciders chilled and ready.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Right, we do have a refrigerator before it became widely used. Being a scholar sure is useful.   
   
**F：???:**  
Though I have chemicals that need to be stored at low temperatures. It's necessary for scholars.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Sure, sure.   
   
**Mordred:**   
(...Gulp, gulp gulp) Whew! That's the stuff. It really hits the spot coming out of that demonic fog!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Mmm&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
What are you two doing? Don't just stand there. Find a place to sit.   
   
**Mordred:**   
My home is your home. This is my temporary base.   
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, right...Senpai, what should we do? Is it all right to sit?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I suppose...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You with the glasses...Can I ask you something?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**F：???:**  
...Haha. Well, all right, I don't mind. If Saber trusts you, I'm sure we're on the same side.   
   
**F：???:**  
I haven't introduced myself yet. I am Henry Jekyll.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
I work in London as a scholar&mdash; A scientist. Though not officially a mage, I am familiar with elixirs.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
One day, all of a sudden,London was blanketed by this fog. It was a nightmare.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
I was able to figure out that the fog contained magical energy, but was at a loss about what to do.   
   
**Mordred:**   
That's when we met and started working together.   
   
**Mordred:**   
He isn't very reliable as a mage,but comes in handy in his own way.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I provide the muscle. He investigates and analyzes.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Exactly.   
   
**Mash:**   
Um&mdash;Excuse me. Mr. Henry Jekyll?   
   
**Mash:**   
That name, um...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's the same name as a character in a novel. Coincidence? Or perhaps he was the model for that character?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash, can you detect the presence of a Servant? I can't. You're inside, but you might as well be outside.   
   
**Mash:**   
I can't either, Doctor. I can't tell if this presence is human or not.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
I assure you, I am a genuine human. If it's a Servant you want, they're outside, investigating.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
And what were you talking about? A novel?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. A book that was published a little before this era. The main character shares your name.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
I don't recall that. Strange, as I do read my share of novels...  
   
**Jekyll:**   
The same name as the main character? Really? Hmm, I don't think I could forget that.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Well, let's set that aside. It is a very common name, after all.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
&mdash;As I was saying, I am Henry Jekyll. All I want to do is stop this blight on my hometown.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
But the more important matter at hand is you folks. You're slightly different from us, aren't you?   
   
**Mordred:**   
&mdash;Hmm...Singularity, huh?   
   
**Jekyll:**   
One of seven bolts that were driven into the world. And...the London of this era is that bolt.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. We're searching for the Holy Grail,which we believe causes the Singularity.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
I understand your situation now, more or less. Now, let me tell you of the city's circumstances that we're aware of.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Each night for the past three nights,a lethal fog has descended upon London.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
If you wear a mask in an area where the fog is thin,you probably won't die from it.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
But it's no good where it's thick. Normal creatures will be corrupted by the magical energy just by breathing it.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
It probably depends on one's predisposition,but in the worst cases, death comes within an hour.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
I don't have the exact numbers, but according to my calculations, several hundred thousand have died.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
There are areas that have become ghost towns already. The East End is just about wiped out.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
It's only a matter of time before the entire city is nothing but ruins.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
It's all because of that fog. An extraordinary dense fog laced with potent magical energy&mdash;  
   
**Jekyll:**   
For now, we're calling it Demonic Fog.   
   
**Mash:**   
London, covered by a deadly fog...It's slightly similar to an incident that will occur in the 20th century.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Is it off by a century? That's probably what the Singularity is...But...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'll look at the 20th century case, too. I had thought this was a one city deal, but it's getting pretty complicated.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
It's not just the Demonic Fog. You two should've engaged in combat as well.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
These past three days&mdash;on top of the Demonic Fog,London has been plagued with other types of threats.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Those committing atrocities under cover of the fog. Automatas made of magecraft, killer homunculi...  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Helter Skelter&mdash;  
   
**Jekyll:**   
And there's a serial killer. The newspapers call them "Jack the Ripper. "  
   
**Mash:**   
The newspapers?   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Yes, the newspapers were still being printed on the first day of the Demonic Fog...Though no longer.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Understandably, it seems neither Scotland Yard nor the government has a handle on the situation.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Government functions are already starting to freeze up. External support is hindered by the fog, isolating London.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
It's already been three days. A cooped-up populace won't last long.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
The Demonic Fog doesn't go indoors,but once food and water runs out, London will perish.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...That's horrifying. The situation requires quick response. All right then, Mr. Jekyll and Mordred.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I have a proposal. We'd like you to help us search for the Holy Grail, the likely origin of this situation.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Nothing would suit us better. Right, Saber?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Fine with me. It seems like the best thing to do.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good, this will truly help us! In more ways than one!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So&ndash; Mash and Fujimaru,lucky for us, this apartment is over a Leyline!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Excuse me?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We can put a Terminal Point here.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fouuu!   
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai and Fou. It's possible to set up a Summoning Circle in this room.   
   
**Mash:**   
Maybe Mr. Jekyll knew about the Leyline and intentionally built his apartment over it?   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Oh, no, I'm not a legitimate mage, so this isn't a magecraft workshop. It's just a regular room.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
At any rate, feel free to use it as you please. What are you going to do?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We'll put the Servant summoning circle over the Leyline to boost Fujimaru and Mash's combat abilities.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Servants summoned by the circle aren't always active,but they're a huge help during battles!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All right! Let's start setting it up!   
   
**Mash:**   
Roger. Creating Terminal Point&mdash;  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
While they make the circle,I'll help you pass the time.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Previously, I spoke about Servant class affinity,so I think I'll expand on that.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Just as each Heroic Spirit has a story to tell, they have classifications that explain how they were born.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
There are three attributes: Heaven, Earth, and Human. Most Servants fall under one of these categories.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Heaven includes Divine Spirits demoted to Heroic Spirits,children of gods, and embodiments of legends.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Earth includes legendary heroes that took hold in the land, fairies, and Demonic Beasts.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Human is for heroes and great people who actually existed. I'm included in this group, as a great artist who actually existed.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Heaven wins over Earth, but loses to Human. Earth wins over Human, but loses to Heaven.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And Human wins over Heaven, but loses to Earth.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Humans believe in gods. However,gods that they stop believing in become "nonexistent. "  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Native heroes and fairies have nothing to do with faith. However, they are no match for the gods that created them.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...And there are rare, special Heroic Spirits that do not belong in any of the three attributes.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
They are an exception of exceptions. &ndash;The Heroic Spirits of the Star.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
They do not belong to Heaven, Earth, or Human. Yet they exist on earth under heaven, and are born of humans.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Servants of the Star have nothing to do with Heaven,Earth, or Humans. After all, they're an exception.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That said, these are nothing more than categories.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The effects aren't as pronounced as Class affinity,so it's not worth integrating into a strategy.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...And that wraps up this session. Summoning circle setup complete. Good luck in this era, too!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Thank you, Da Vinci, thank you! Thank you yet again!   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Who was that just now? She was beautiful,but...She wasn't actually here, was she?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fouuu!   
   
**Jekyll:**   
???  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Mmm. I remember seeing him somewhere before. Phantasmal?   
   
**Fou:**   
F-Fouuuu...  
   
**Mash:**   
Fou?   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Perhaps a rare animal from around Africa? Anyway,Saber, and this concerns Mash and Fujimaru, too.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
This is abrupt&ndash;but I would like to ask you three to do something.   
   
**Mordred:**   
We just got back and we have to go out into the Demonic Fog again? Good grief.   
   
**Mash:**   
I apologize for asking you to lead the way. It's just that we're not used to London yet.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, it's fine. Don't worry. If you guys hadn't come here,this work would've had to be all mine.   
   
**Mordred:**   
If anything, I should be thanking you. Sorry for making you come along based on vague information.   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, no, Mordred. Not at all...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Protecting one of Mr. Jekyll's other collaborators,the Swiss scholar Mr. Frankenstein, huh?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Seems he's been unreachable since this morning. Do you normally communicate with each other via radio?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Jekyll does. He calls it his information network. I don't really understand it.   
   
**Mordred:**   
He has collaborators all over the city and chats with them on the radio every day.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Old man Victor was safe until yesterday at least.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Victor Frankenstein, huh...Just when we thought it's another character from a novel, it turns out to be his "relative. "  
   
**Mash:**   
The grandchild of the mage that became the model character in the novel, was what Mr. Jekyll mentioned.   
   
**Mash:**   
Unexpected, indeed. In Mary Shelly's novel...  
   
**Mash:**   
Dr. Frankenstein was a scientist. But the person he was modeled after was a real-life mage.   
   
**Mash:**   
It brings to mind that idiom about how "truth is stranger than fiction".   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is it that strange?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are scientists and mages really that different?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. Strictly speaking,magecraft and science are contrary to each other.   
   
**Mash:**   
Chaldea's existence is an extreme exception, and if you think about it, both globally and historically&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh yes, but everything has an exception. In a certain era,science and magecraft virtually meant the same thing.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
For example, even if you set aside ancient times,some will say alchemy is the origin of chemistry.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There are numerous examples of mages who are known as renowned scientists, chemists, and scholars.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You know,Da Vinci is one such example.   
   
**Mash:**   
Ah&mdash;  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Mmm. You called?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, you're talking about science and magecraft. I'm no help there. After all...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm almighty. You can't compare me to anyone. Too bad. Bye.   
   
**Mash:**   
Ah! We lost the connection.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's with her, anyway?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Da Vinci is way too carefree...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I know...  
   
**Mordred:**   
We're near Soho. Keep your guard up now. They'll be here soon.   
   
**Mordred:**   
The edge of the City Area where Jekyll's apartment is seems relatively peaceful in comparison.   
   
**Mordred:**   
This area is no good. We're in their territory.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So it appears. I'm picking up multiple motion signals. It'll be a fight, so watch out!   
   
**Mash:**   
Right. Master, your orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Damn. They're coming again. I wish I could unleash my Noble Phantasm at will.   
   
**Mash:**   
We're inside the city. I'm sorry, but you must get your temper under control.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I know that, Shieldy. Ugh, somehow I feel weird when you tell me that.   
   
**Mash:**   
Hold on. "Shieldy? "Are you referring to me?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh? You have a shield, don't you? You use it to defend and bash people in the face.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Or, does "Ms. Shieldy" sound better? I don't care which one you pick.   
   
**Mash:**   
...That's okay. Just call me "Shieldy," please...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The enemy is trying to flank us from both sides. Can you take care of the right side, Saber Mordred?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Leave it to me. I usually deal with everything by myself.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Are you ready over there, Fujimaru?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, I'm ready!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Strike foes from the left!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Roger. Entering battle with hostiles!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second?   
   
**Mash:**   
I, um...  
   
**Mordred:**   
What? Speak up. If you have something to say, just say it.   
   
**Mash:**   
All right, then.   
   
**Mash:**   
I have a question for you. Why are you fighting here?   
   
**Mash:**   
Mr. Jekyll is fighting to protect his hometown. But what about you&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
I already told you, didn't I? I'm here to face the perils of Father's beloved Londinium.   
   
**Mash:**   
Well, sure...I mean...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I did hear that when we first met. I understand that, really, but...  
   
**Mash:**   
I hope you won't get upset, but for some reason,I...I feel like...it's for a different reason.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...Jeez.   
   
**Mordred:**   
All right. I didn't even tell Jekyll about this, you know?   
   
**Mordred:**   
I just&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yes, that's right. I just can't allow the land of Britain to be violated by someone other than me.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I'm the only one allowed to violate the land King Arthur loved. I can't let anyone else do that.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So distorted...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hm? Did you say something?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, not at all.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Not particularly.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
If you want to say something, say it. Well, anyway...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Don't worry. I will give you the Holy Grail once we find it.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I won't say "I want it after all" or anything. And even if I did, it wouldn't serve any purpose.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I'm Mordred, the Treacherous Knight. But this time it's special, and I'll be on the defender's side.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Honestly, I was hesitating a bit. Meeting you guys cleared up my mind.   
   
**Mash:**   
What do you mean?   
   
**Mordred:**   
I mean, someone worthy of being the owner finally showed up. You can have the Holy Grail.   
   
**Mash:**   
???  
   
**Mordred:**   
Enough chitchat. Don't bring up this topic ever again.   
   
**Mordred:**   
We're almost at the mansion, but enemies are here again. Well then, shall we rip them apart?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mordred's detection is amazing. Is it an Intuition skill? We detected hostile reactions too. There'll be three waves!   
   
**Mash:**   
Roger. Master, orders please!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
All right, we're here. This big building is Victor's mansion.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Unlike Jekyll who's half-assed,he is a genuine mage, so be careful.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Traps like barriers and such are set up all over, so even Servants get hurt if they touch things without knowing.   
   
**Mordred:**   
When I first visited to check things out,I had an absolutely terrible experience here.   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, okay. I'll be careful, then.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A death trap workshop in an urban area...Sounds like a cautious old guy with pretty strong nerves.   
   
**Mordred:**   
The first challenge is the entrance door. See, look at that big door&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
&mdash;Damn, we're too late.   
   
**Mash:**   
Someone is at the entrance...A tall silhouette...A clown?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, you! Scarecrow! Or are you a living statue? Whatever! Anyway...  
   
**Mordred:**   
...you stink like hell. It's like blood, guts, and fire.   
   
**Mordred:**   
And the catalyst for the old man's favorite elemental spell? I can smell it from here!   
   
**Mordred:**   
You killed him, didn't you. You murdered Victor Frankenstein.   
   
**???:**  
Yes, I did&mdash;Well, no, let me see. Just a moment, please.   
   
**???:**  
Indeed, indeed. That elderly man will not open his mouth, brush his teeth, eat food, or breathe ever again.   
   
**???:**  
Yes, yes. Frankly speaking, I'm certain he is dead.   
   
**???:**  
It's a shame. He refused to join our cause. Right till the very end.   
   
**???:**  
But, and yet, however. Who killed Victor Frankenstein?   
   
**???:**  
That might be quite a difficult question to answer. Because he "blew himself up. "  
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**???:**  
Oh, my. Did I scare the beautiful young lady?   
   
**???:**  
My apologies. As you can see, I am a demon after all&mdash;  
   
**???:**  
That was a joke, and I'm sorry for letting you down,but I'm actually a Heroic Spirit.   
   
**???:**  
I'm a Servant just like you. The class is Caster.   
   
**???:**  
...Oh? Well, folks, you don't get it?   
   
**Mordred:**   
That's enough. Shut up.   
   
**???:**  
No, I'm sure you got that. You wonder why I revealed my class so easily?   
   
**???:**  
It is reasonable during a Holy Grail War unlike any other. At least that lady over there knows why!   
   
**???:**  
An encounter instantly becomes an all-out battle! As we are Servants without Masters&mdash;  
   
**???:**  
We can be called the most powerful forces on the earth. However...  
   
**???:**  
Sadly, it seems that you have a Master. Best you protect yourself well. Otherwise, in no time...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Enough small talk. And wipe that grin off your face right now.   
   
**???:**  
Pardon?   
   
**Mordred:**   
That smirk of a smile! So annoying! Was it really that fun to kill that old man?   
   
**???:**  
Well, sure&mdash;  
   
**???:**  
Once he rejected our cause,it was like a job to me, so to speak.   
   
**Mash:**   
Cause?   
   
**???:**  
When you are obligated to do something,it's usually quite a nuisance, indeed.   
   
**???:**  
But still, it feels good to do your best. You will work hard for a job you enjoy.   
   
**???:**  
His expression in the moment he died. The face of a human who understood the transition from life to death!   
   
**???:**  
Despair! Sorrow! Ah! That is exactly it&mdash;!   
   
**???:**  
Well, anyway, something like that&mdash;  
   
**???:**  
It killed my boredom? At least, I guess?   
   
**Mordred:**   
...I see.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Immigrant or not, that old man was a citizen of Britain. Listen, you took him...  
   
**Mordred:**   
You put your hand on "my stuff" without my permission. You know what will happen?   
   
**???:**  
&mdash;What?   
   
**Mordred:**   
&mdash;I'm saying, I'm going to kill you, dumb-ass clown!   
   
**???:**  
Well, well, well! You? Killing me? Can you, really?   
   
**???:**  
You seem to be a hot-blooded person! Good, that's fine. I'll try not to disappoint you then!   
   
**???:**  
You might as well watch out for the explosions! My Noble Phantasm has already been set up!   
   
**???:**  
By my True Name, Mephistopheles! I shall relish striking you all down into despair!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You've set up what!? Dammit! I don't know if it's because of the fog or his skill, but it's undetectable!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, hostile Servant approaching! Orders, please&mdash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Get him!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Fight and watch out for his Noble Phantasm!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Roger!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
This is quite...regretful! This materialization was one I couldn't enjoy much of...  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
I suppose Servants need Masters after all...Yes, the power of the bond between Master and Servant...  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Something of it...Not. Yes, definitely not.   
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Once a Master decides to fulfill an earnest wish, I must make at least one child must die by the Master's hand.   
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
Otherwise you can't enjoy the best part of a Holy Grail War. Oh, I envy you, Shield Servant...  
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
You will have countless chances from here onwards...to betray and throw your Master into despair!   
   
**Mephistopheles:**   
I am so...jealous of you!   
   
**Mordred:**   
&mdash;Shut up.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...Did you find anything?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. I found the note the doctor left. Apparently, he was writing this when he was attacked.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I see. I must say, he was a lax old guy until the end.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I'll read it out loud.   
   
**Mash:**   
"I learned of a certain plot. Its name is 'Project Demonic Fog. ' Though its present state is still unknown,"  
   
**Mash:**   
"The three leaders of the project are 'P', 'B' and 'M', who can cast spells beyond human wisdom. Probably Heroic Spirits. "  
   
**Mordred:**   
Is "M" the guy from earlier? Well, let's take this back and have Jekyll read it, too.   
   
**Mordred:**   
And now...I've found something interesting, too.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, come over here.   
   
**H：???:**  
...Uh.   
   
**Mash:**   
...A girl?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She has a horn.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, she does have a horn...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is she human? Or a Servant?   
   
**Mash:**   
Who knows? It would be the best if we ask her.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Are you a human? Or are you a Servant just like us?   
   
**H：???:**  
...Uhh.   
   
**Mash:**   
?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm, I can't determine what she is...All I can read is that there are vital and physical reactions.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It seems the detection issues caused by the Demonic Fog can reach indoors, too. How about you, Mash?   
   
**Mash:**   
I can't figure it out, either. How about you, Mordred?   
   
**Mordred:**   
I can't tell for sure by just her presence. I think the Demonic Fog outside is interrupting.   
   
**Mordred:**   
But, you're asking what she is? Of course she's a Servant&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
At least I wish I could say that.... In my memory, that's how it was supposed to be...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Anyway, yes. She is an artificial human. Apparently.   
   
**Mash:**   
An artificial human&mdash;is she?   
   
**Mordred:**   
I found her in the coffin in the backroom,and a note was attached. Let me see...  
   
**Mordred:**   
First artificial human created by Grandfather Victor Frankenstein, or something like that.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So it is Frankenstein's monster. But didn't it burn up in the end according to the novel?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I wonder if she can hear my voice. Let's see...Are you Frankenstein's monster?   
   
**H：???:**  
...Uhh, ah...uuuh...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hm?   
   
**Mash:**   
It seems like she doesn't have a speech function. But I can somehow understand her.   
   
**H：???:**  
......  
   
**Mash:**   
Name, I guess. Monster&mdash;is certainly a name you don't like, right?   
   
**H：???:**  
...Uhh.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then, how about Fran?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**H：???:**  
...Uh...  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, she seems to be happy with the name. Okay then, Ms. Fran.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh...  
   
**Mash:**   
You are an artificial human...Is that correct?   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh, uh...  
   
**Mordred:**   
You're not a Servant, huh. Oh, I get it. You mean, "you're still alive. "  
   
**Mordred:**   
I finally understand. No wonder I couldn't figure it out just by looking at you.   
   
**Mash:**   
?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, never mind.   
   
**Mordred:**   
We can't just leave her here,so let's take her back to Jekyll.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh, uh...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Your master is no longer here. You can go anywhere you want.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I'll let you stay with Jekyll for now. Let's go. The fog shouldn't impact you if you're an artificial human.   
   
**Mash:**   
Is she...really? I'm not so sure about that. That's a dangerous action.   
   
**Mordred:**   
She's going to be fine! She's not breathing. Right, Fran?   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh.   
   
**Mordred:**   
See. She's nodding.   
   
## Section 4: One Book, One Pen   
   
**Jekyll:**   
This girl&mdash;yes, Fran is an artificial human. Her physical composition was not of a spirit. She's not a Heroic Spirit.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
She is a human living in this era. Wait, I guess artificial human.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Maybe the description in the novel was wrong...Though I can't be that positive about it.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh...Uh...  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Hmm?   
   
**Mash:**   
Um, well...She's just...I mean... How can I say this...  
   
**Mordred:**   
You touched around her body insisting it was an inspection, and it made her unhappy. Apologize to her, Jekyll.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Oh. I'm very sorry. How shameful of me. That was unacceptable from an English gentleman.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
?   
   
**Mash:**   
It's fine, as long as you understand...That was the nuance in her voice...I think.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Most likely.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, that's what she said.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How are you guys understanding her?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jekyll:**   
How do you guys know what she thinks? Is it because you're the "same gender"...Oh, no, nothing!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Next time, I will kill you.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Yes. Yup. Sorry. I'll never say it again. Anyway&mdash;another case showed up in my info network.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Something strange appeared in the Soho area. Apparently it even slips indoors to assault civilians.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let me confirm. The homunculi, automata,and Helter Skelters until now&mdash;  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Have zero cases of entering buildings. At least not according to my information network and Saber's patrols.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
What is entering buildings and attacking civilians appears to be a book as big as a human.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
I decided to tentatively call them Magical Tomes. I want you to deal with this.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Whether this is related to "Project Demonic Fog" is uncertain, but at the very least, there have been victims in Soho.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
I need your help. Will you do it?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Leave it to me.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's no use staying still.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I agree, Master. We're some of the few able to go outdoors.   
   
**Mash:**   
I will try my best to be of help to you, Senpai. Rather, it would make me happy...  
   
**Mordred:**   
What are you talking about? Doesn't matter if you're a Demi or whatever, you're still a Servant.   
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...Oh, I mean...Well, just forget it.   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
Master-Servant relationships are case-by-case. It's not something I should interfere with.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Now, shall we? I don't know if Fran can be useful, so she'll stay here.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh, uh......Uh...  
   
**Mordred:**   
What, are you lonely? Just be a good girl and wait. We'll be right back.   
   
**Mash:**   
It's dangerous outside. Let's talk again when we come back.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh, uh.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Huge book...A Magical Tome, huh? A kind of monster that didn't exist in Britain back in my day.   
   
**Mash:**   
The Britain when you were alive...Did monsters exist back in the times of the Arthurian legends?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Of course. The Knights of the Round Table even fought dragons and giants.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Deep woods, steep mountains, bluffs with unceasing winds. Realms humans never cross are prime dens for Phantasmals.   
   
**Mordred:**   
They come down to human dwellings every so often. And well, ordinary humans usually end up as their food.   
   
**Mash:**   
Food, you say.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Average soldiers are no match for demonic beasts,dragons, or Phantasmals. Even in your era, most weapons are useless.   
   
**Mordred:**   
But there are exceptions. For Britain&mdash;it was the Knights of the Round Table.   
   
**Mordred:**   
We fought well, and killed a reasonable number,you know? Battling a Phantasmal is pretty rough&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, and them. Them...The Picts.   
   
**Mash:**   
In our time, they're seen as a very mysterious people. A tribe that once flourished mainly in Scotland, so we've heard.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Well, rather than people, they were...Um...  
   
**Mordred:**   
They weren't like any tribes or barbarians...They went far beyond any of them.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Describing it in terms of your era, they were like something that would be in a sci-fi movie, you know?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Aliens? Or, something like that. Yes, that's a close one.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
An Arthurian joke?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Ah, that's a funny joke.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai. I heard it as a joke, too.... Oh.   
   
**Mash:**   
Mordred, I...I'm sorry. I completely missed the timing to laugh.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm, that was an Arthurian joke? So you're supposed to miss the timing...Hm, I see.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Joke? No, I wasn't joking at all&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
Wait, I sense enemies. Most of them are automatas.   
   
**Mash:**   
...It's a battle. Master, your orders please!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Crushed the dolls. There.   
   
**Mordred:**   
But&mdash;What is this sort of thing even called?   
   
**Mordred:**   
In Asia they have a term for it, don't they? "En" or something. It's like fate?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Gathering all sorts of Heroic Spirits and making them your allies&mdash;That's not something you can achieve easily.   
   
**Mordred:**   
But well, if that's the way you're using the summons I guess it's possible.   
   
**Mordred:**   
This method should indeed make Heroic Spirit summons easier. I can imagine who it was that suggested it.   
   
**Mordred:**   
To be honest, it feels strange to me......But that, I suppose, is also fate.   
   
**Mash:**   
?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is Mordred talking about?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is it about the summoning system?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes...It seems so, anyways. Are you talking about the Heroic Spirit Summoning System?   
   
**Mash:**   
Um...Mordred, do you know much about Heroic Spirit summons? Like you're a Saber with magecraft knowledge?   
   
**Mordred:**   
What did you just say, Shieldy? Do I have magecraft knowledge? Are you being sarcastic or...  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Wait, that's not what you meant, huh. Argh, you're such a pain in the ass, Mash!   
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes...! I don't know why I just got scolded,but in any case I'm very sorry!   
   
**Mordred:**   
I'm not scolding, it's just a complaint! That's another thing you two have in common!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
"You two? "  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Forget it. That was a slip of the tongue. Don't probe any further, Fujimaru.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Touchy, aren't you?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Of course, I am. Being cranky is my default mode. It's 'cause I'm a mass killer, as far from a saint as one can be.   
   
**Mordred:**   
You guys are the ones that are getting too close in the first place. People are normally scared of me, being the Treacherous Knight and all.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Tch! Look, you guys aren't the problem here, okay? It's my own nature that's the problem.   
   
**Mordred:**   
So don't misunderstand me. It's not that I hate either Mash or Fujimaru. I don't hate you, that's not it, but&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
I can't help myself. Come on, let's fight. Get that shield up. I'll batter it to pieces.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You ARE upset!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Treacherous Berserker!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah, insult me all you want. I'm used to it. Feels better than awkward compliments.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I won't let Mash engage in needless battles.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
To fight Mash, go through me first  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, so you CAN act like a Master. Though it would've looked a lot cooler if your knees weren't shaking, you know?   
   
**Mordred:**   
The weak should act like one and stay back. Because they meddle in things like that, they're the first to die, yeah?   
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;! Master, get back! Mordred is serious!   
   
**Mordred:**   
You parried my first attack! How cheeky! You're finally learning how to use that thing the way you should!   
   
**Mordred:**   
That's good. Here goes, Shieldy! You must always be one step ahead of your own limit to protect your allies!   
   
**Mordred:**   
If you're gonna use that Noble Phantasm, put some spirit in it! As an experienced Servant, I will train you thoroughly!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Hah...Ah...Ugh...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash!   
   
**Mash:**   
Sen...pai&mdash; Thank goodness. Were you watching?   
   
**Mash:**   
Battle...is over&mdash;I...was able to parry...Mordred's attacks&mdash;  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mordred!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Oof...Don't glare at me like that. I regret that I went a little overboard. You seriously look scary right now.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Don't worry, that was a mock fight. Mash was fully aware of that too.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
So, how was it, Mash? Figured out how to use that Noble Phantasm at least a little bit?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes...Thank you...Very much...Somehow, it feels&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
...like a shackle on my heart was removed...That was the toughest I've felt since Cú Chulainn's spells...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then perhaps...that just now was?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Well, drastic times call for drastic measures.   
   
**Mordred:**   
She was holding herself back by calling herself a Demi-Servant.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I pulled a stunt here to hammer into her what her role was. She'll be a bit more decent from now on.   
   
**Mash:**   
Mordred...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
 You look after others well.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Even so, a bit too rough...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Shut up. You guys drop your guard way too much and it was pissing me off, that's all.   
   
**Mordred:**   
It's not like me to teach swordsmanship to others. In fact, this was my first time. Damn you!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Listen. Not a word of this to Jekyll. He'll interrogate me again.   
   
**Mordred:**   
And sorry, Fujimaru. I apologize for disrespecting you. You are indeed weak, but it's a practical kind of weak.   
   
**Mordred:**   
You're no coward nor scoundrel. You're an idiot worth carrying, in your own way. Right, Mash?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, definitely! After all, Senpai is the best Master in Chaldea!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks, Mash.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Best in Chaldea is saying too much...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Okay, okay, enough already. This is so sweet I'm getting indigestion.   
   
**Mordred:**   
All right, time to hurry onward, Fujimaru,Mash. Keep that shield at the ready and follow me.   
   
**Mash:**   
Okay! Thank you very much, kind Sir Mordred!   
   
**Mordred:**   
D-Don't suddenly start calling me "Sir Mordred," dummy! You're gonna make me trip!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
All hostile units eliminated...Complete silence confirmed. Good work, Senpai.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good work. I received a transmission from Jekyll, so I'll connect you.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Can you hear me? I have supplemental information to pass on.   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh&mdash;I see. They took the radio transmission from Jekyll and patched it through via Dr. Roman's channel.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Right. Chaldea's technology is marvelous. But let me cut to the chase. It's about the Magical Tome running amok in Soho.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Unlike killer homunculi or automatas, the Magical Tome can get past closed doors and into buildings. That we know.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
We have specifics on the damage now. They say it puts people into an unending slumber.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Through magecraft? Or a drug?   
   
**Jekyll:**   
We don't know yet. If it's just a drug, it shouldn't pose any issue for you...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I don't think that would affect us. Senpai has Poison Resistance Skill (Temporary), too.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I see, that's good. But well, nothing beats good, old-fashioned vigilance.   
   
**Mordred:**   
If it is magecraft, in my case, my Magic Resistance Skill nullifies most effects on me&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
But I can't block a direct hit of, say, a drug made by a Servant's skill or Noble Phantasm at high magecraft levels.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's be really careful.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's okay if it doesn't hit us.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Well, yeah. Just act carefully.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Once you've arrived in the Soho area,stop by the antique bookshop I specified first.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
There should be an informant there. That is,if they haven't been attacked by Magical Tomes yet.   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Then let's get going. Soho's not far off now.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Boy:**   
...So you've finally come. I was getting pretty sick of waiting, you idiots.   
   
**Boy:**   
Thanks to you, I've ended up reading an entire novel series, roughly 20 volumes, that I didn't even want to read.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who's this?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A child?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?   
   
**Boy:**   
You're the rescue team Mr. Henry Jekyll said was coming? Then, let me quickly fill you in on the situation here.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh? Wait, so the informant he mentioned is this brat?   
   
**Mash:**   
This boy, as it were. He must have some relation to this antique bookshop.   
   
**Mash:**   
Maybe he's the shopkeeper's son or relative...or grandson. Is that correct?   
   
**Mash:**   
You're the one who contacted Mr. Jekyll,and are seeking help from us, right?   
   
**Boy:**   
Yes, that's right. The situation being what it is,a rough understanding is fine for now.   
   
**Mordred:**   
You kind of...have a really nice voice. Is your voice changing right now?   
   
**Boy:**   
Yeah, I've always wanted to be in theaters.   
   
**Boy:**   
So embarrassing. Nothing more embarrassing than a life where you couldn't achieve what you want!   
   
**Boy:**   
Well, we'll put talk of my beautiful voice aside. I'll be talking your ears off from here, anyway.   
   
**Boy:**   
For now, let's talk about "this place. " The Magical Tome already assaulted the elderly shopkeeper here.   
   
**Boy:**   
Nearly half of Soho's people met the same fate. They've fallen into unending slumber, and now dream merrily together.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Do you know where the Magical Tome is now? Also, how did you manage to escape its attack?   
   
**Boy:**   
Huh? Are you stupid? Is your brain, not just your voice,in la-la land? Obviously, I ran away from it!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? ...Oh! Um, s-sorry...Of course...That makes perfect sense...Ha, ha, sorry...I apologize...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ha, ha...Ha, ha, ha...  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, please don't get hurt by a child's words. Kids that age tend to speak very bluntly.   
   
**Boy:**   
So, you asked where the Magical Tome is. Right here.   
   
**Mordred:**   
What?   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?   
   
**Boy:**   
It's on the 2nd floor residence of the bookshop...In other words, still on this floor, in the study next door.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Haha! Well, well! So it's right there?   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, indoor combat is dangerous. We should avoid combat in narrow, enclosed spaces if we can.   
   
**Mash:**   
There is a chance that you and the boy would get caught up in the fight.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Then let's fight in an open space.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Lure it outside!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...All right. Mordred, if you will.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Okay, let's get this over with!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou!?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Dammit, I know the attacks are hitting, but they're not getting through! What's with this book?   
   
**Mash:**   
I don't get it either. Our attacks are landing, but it's not going down!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmmm are you sure it's not an illusion? And are you sure your attacks are hitting?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Doctor. We have no status anomalies.   
   
**Magical Tome:**   
......  
   
**Mordred:**   
Tch, floating around like that! So cheeky for a book, are you missing pages or something!?   
   
**Boy:**   
More like a banned book. If the contents are true, then even as a book it can kill people...Or so the story goes.   
   
**Mash:**   
The boy from earlier...You shouldn't come out! It's dangerous! Go back!   
   
**Boy:**   
Keep watching the Magical Tome, miss. Don't worry about me, I'll take off as soon as I say what needs to be said.   
   
**Mordred:**   
You...I thought you had a good voice, but I never thought.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Are you by chance a Servant? Damn, this fog is clouding my intuition!   
   
**Boy:**   
You finally noticed. Yes, I'm a Heroic Spirit like you. Or rather&mdash;  
   
**Boy:**   
Did you think a kid reading rare books so calmly in a time like this is normal?   
   
**Boy:**   
The ability to detect magical energy aside, your intuition as a reader is abysmal, Saber. You should read more.   
   
**Boy:**   
I recommend the series in shelf E on the 1st floor. They're full of dreams, adventures, and bad endings you might like.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey&mdash;who the hell are you! You sure know how to jok&mdash;  
   
**Andersen:**   
Andersen. Hans Christian Andersen.   
   
**Andersen:**   
My class is Caster. If you want to know the details, read one of my books.   
   
**Mash:**   
What? What? &mdash;Whaaat!?   
   
**Mash:**   
Hans Christian Andersen, the author&ndash; Amazing...He's one of the top three fairy tale authors in the world, Senpai!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Calm down.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you like fairy tales?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, no...Well...I wouldn't say I love them,but I have read quite a few of them.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Oh. You don't have to hide it, it's obvious! You're an avid reader! I have an avid reader among Servants!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
First characters from fictional novels,now an actual author! And, our enemy is a book!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay, it's turning into another confusing situation, Fujimaru!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So how's Mr. Andersen? Is he amazing as a Servant!?   
   
**Andersen:**   
Huh? What does that bonehead expect? I'm an author. Of course I'm absolutely powerless.   
   
**Andersen:**   
It's neat to encounter a Magical Tome that attacks people, but it's literally impossible for me to defeat it alone.   
   
**Andersen:**   
So, here I am, waiting for Servants fit for physical labor to show up!   
   
**Andersen:**   
Now go fight, Saber and Ms. Avid Reader! I'll keep detailed notes of the entire affair!   
   
**Fou:**   
Mmm, kyuu! Kyaau!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Shut up, please shut up! I feel like killing you before the Magical Tome!   
   
**Andersen:**   
What? Not only do you lack intelligence to study the Magical Tome, you can't make distinctions between friend and foe?   
   
**Andersen:**   
Amazing. An extreme barbarian! You know,your head must be filled with mashed potatoes!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Move aside, Shieldy! I'm going to beat the crap out of that punk first!   
   
**Mash:**   
I know how you feel but calm down! Mr. Andersen, please say something to her, too!   
   
**Andersen:**   
Say something? Oh, something beneficial. Hmm. Well then, here's a lecture.   
   
**Andersen:**   
You have experienced the nature of the Magical Tome,yes? Attacks are ineffective. Of course they are.   
   
**Andersen:**   
It's because you think it's a book. It's not. It's a type of Reality Marble.   
   
**Mash:**   
Reality Marble!?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Reality Marble?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
As I recall, that's...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. It's a type of powerful magecraft that rewrites how the world exists. They say it's almost equivalent to True Magic.   
   
**Mash:**   
Rarely, there are cases when a Servant materialized uses it as their Noble Phantasm&mdash;  
   
**Andersen:**   
Right, maybe a Reality Marble affects the space it's in. But that's different. Its existence itself is a Reality Marble.   
   
**Andersen:**   
That's why it has endurance near invincibility. It effectively utilizes the fact it is a Reality Marble.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Then, why is that possible? Good. That's a natural question.   
   
**Andersen:**   
But figure out that much on your own! There's plenty of food for thought, anyone can make sense of it in minutes!   
   
**Mordred:**   
But we don't have those few minutes! State the conclusion! The conclusion!   
   
**Mordred:**   
It's floating right now,but we don't know when it will attack again!   
   
**Andersen:**   
How hasty...Do you start books at the ending? Oh, fine. Out of respect for the avid reader, I'll tell you.   
   
**Andersen:**   
My reason by analogy is that it originally was a Servant that projects the psyche of its Master.   
   
**Andersen:**   
It's easy if you elicit from dramaturgy. Though, I needed to ponder for about an hour.   
   
**Mordred:**   
You took your sweet time! Enough! State the conclusion! The conclusion!   
   
**Andersen:**   
The conclusion, or rather, the problem is before you. This is a "stray. " There is no Master.   
   
**Andersen:**   
That's why it attacked the people in Soho. It put them to sleep and made them dream.   
   
**Andersen:**   
In short, it's searching for a Master. To manifest the dream, it's "trying to materialize" as a Pseudo-Servant.   
   
**Mordred:**   
What?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I see! So the guise of this Magical Tome has no substance!   
   
**Andersen:**   
Good answer! It's not even a Servant. It's a clump of magical energy that wants to be a Servant.   
   
**Andersen:**   
It will materialize eventually if left alone. In return, every citizen of Soho will fall asleep.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Compared to the fog of magical energy drifting outside,the damage may not be as vicious.   
   
**Andersen:**   
However.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Some may become emaciated and die while asleep,but perhaps nobody will die.   
   
**Andersen:**   
To begin with, if sleep takes so much of one's time,we writers would go out of business!   
   
**Andersen:**   
So, it will be defeated. Soho has many bookstores, both new and used.   
   
**Mash:**   
You contradict yourself, Mr. Andersen! You just said it has no substance so we can't defeat&mdash;  
   
**Andersen:**   
I mean, you can't look for a book without a title. It's easy to give substance to a story.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Can you hear me? I'll give you a name, Magical Tome, no&mdash;  
   
**Andersen:**   
&mdash;A Tale for Someone, Nursery Rhyme!   
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
!!!   
   
**Mordred:**   
You can do things when you actually try, punk! But why didn't you do anything until now!?   
   
**Andersen:**   
Idiot, if I gave it substance, it would attack me, too. Just saying, I'm very weak in fistfights.   
   
**Andersen:**   
I told you I had no choice but to hold my breath and read books until you guys, the physical labor, showed up.   
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
...Nursery...Rhyme...  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
No, it's not. That's not "my" name, "my" name is Alice.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Mmm? Huh?   
   
**Mash:**   
Something...is a bit off from Mr. Andersen's predictions...But, Senpai, this is...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's materializing!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
All's well that ends well!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, the enemy is materializing! Now I can clearly discern its form!   
   
**Mordred:**   
All right. Let's do it! Afterwards, I'm gonna choke that punk!   
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Alice, where are you? Alice isn't...here...  
   
**Nursery Rhyme:**   
Hey, big sisters. Where is the lonely "me? "  
   
**Andersen:**   
...You don't have a Master. No, to be exact, she probably is not in this era.   
   
**Andersen:**   
...I can't believe there was a Master who loved a book without a title this much.   
   
**Andersen:**   
This is what you call painful to watch. I'm sorry, but please defeat it quickly.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Andersen:**   
...All bark and no bite. I was expecting at least a reproduction of Wonderland.   
   
**Andersen:**   
I guess that was expecting too much. It didn't help that we were too powerful.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...Hey. What was that about us being too powerful, punk?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Not only did you stand there like a damn statue,I think all you ever did was run your mouth and insult us!   
   
**Mash:**   
P-Please, let's stop it, Mordred.   
   
**Mash:**   
He has a sharp tongue for sure, but we were able to defeat the Magical Tome&mdash;Nursery Rhyme thanks to him!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Foou!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Tch...You're right. I know. It's my loss if I meddle with people of this sort.   
   
**Andersen:**   
What, contrary to your looks...Wait, maybe you do have that look...Wait, maybe not after all. Your soul is like a Morning Star!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Morning Star, like a flail? So I'm thorny, huh? Dammit! I hate to admit it but you make a good point!   
   
**Andersen:**   
...Good reaction...With training, you might be easy prey...Excuse me, a good reader. What a waste.   
   
**Andersen:**   
But to think I'd be defended from a hater by an avid reader. Humans never change regardless of era.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Both Mash and I are Servants.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. But I was originally a human...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
More like,most Servants were originally humans.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...Tch. Oh well. That thing didn't seem like it used to be human, though.   
   
**Fou:**   
...Fou...  
   
**Andersen:**   
Right, most of Heroic Spirits were humans,but sometimes there are cases like Nursery Rhyme.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Cases where a human creation gains its own will, or gathers visions from people to become a "Conceptual Heroic Spirit. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Those are rare, though. Someday, there might even be Heroic Spirits of machines as well as books.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyway, thank you for all your work. Go back to Jekyll's apartment for now.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Andersen, can you come, too? It's most reassuring to have more Servants as allies.   
   
**Mordred:**   
What?! We're taking this punk with us?   
   
**Mordred:**   
He's super weak. I'm sure he'll be useless! He's so boring, too! I'm sure he won't write any decent books!   
   
**Andersen:**   
&mdash;I see. Okay, I'm happy to go with you.   
   
**Andersen:**   
I had no intention of helping you,but that last statement changed my mind.   
   
**Andersen:**   
My pleasure, Saber. No, Sir Mordred. By the way, if you are to be a protagonist, what's your favorite genre?   
   
**Andersen:**   
A tragedy? A farce? Or a comedy? Splendid. I'll polish it into the best trashy tale ever.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I see. Why don't you go write some unpopular books and cry in a corner, fairy tale author.   
   
**Mash:**   
(Um, excuse me, that's rude, he can hear that)  
   
**Mordred:**   
I wanted him to hear it. Only a coward talks behind one's back.   
   
**Mash:**   
......  
   
**Andersen:**   
Well, let's move. Let's leave before the antique bookshop's owner wakes up.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Because I'm also a thief. Actually, I snuck in from the back door.   
   
**Andersen:**   
It'd be awkward if he woke up and called the cops. Getting arrested despite helping is going too far for a trashy book!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh!?   
   
**Mordred:**   
You entered without permission,and still acted that confidently!?   
   
## Section 5: Helter Skelter   
   
**Andersen:**   
My, what a lovely little hideout. I like it. I'll take the study next door.   
   
**Andersen:**   
I'll be unpacking, so call me if you need me. Oh, and don't forget to knock.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...Wow, I'm so tired. That baggage made me double tired. No, triple tired!   
   
**Jekyll:**   
She's wrecking my personal sofa again...I'd prefer you use the one for guests...Oh, never mind.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Just stay there and listen. Mash, you and Fujimaru too.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Jack the Ripper is back. And this time they're not murdering women in the fog.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
They're currently putting Scotland Yard under siege. I'm picking up calls for help from stations all over London.   
   
**Mordred:**   
That guy! That bastard finally came out!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sounds like a grudge.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
An acquaintance?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah. A Servant of Assassin class. We fought a few times in the fog...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Escapes every time. I can't quite finish 'em off. They escape into the fog!   
   
**Mordred:**   
On top of that, I can't remember a face, figure, or specific abilities! It pisses me off!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Every time I hear "Jack the Ripper,"all I can do is think, "Oh yeah, that Assassin! "  
   
**Mordred:**   
Dammit! It's so frustrating! That stupid little&mdash;  
   
**Jekyll:**   
You may have had an encounter as well. How about it? Do you remember fighting "an Assassin? "  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I think I do...I think it was an Assassin. We...were ambushed...  
   
**Mash:**   
That's right...We were ambushed. My memories suddenly came back to me.   
   
**Mash:**   
I couldn't remember most of the details until now. But, if it's a Servant, we can guess why&mdash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A skill?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A Noble Phantasm?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai. That's right. It's due to either a skill or a Noble Phantasm.   
   
**Mordred:**   
They're fast. We should hurry before they get away. Let's go!   
   
**Andersen:**   
What, stepping out? Then say so. Bring me back...I know! Some scones would be great.   
   
**Mordred:**   
You're not coming!? No, you wouldn't be useful if you did...  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Wait. Can you make them easier to beat, like that last one?   
   
**Andersen:**   
The last one was an extreme exception. Don't count on it. What do you expect an author to do to begin with?   
   
**Andersen:**   
Do you think authors are all-powerful, omniscient gods? Then you need to learn better.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Listen to me. Authors are just fools who fled to the pen when reality wouldn't go their way.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Do you really think I can help you with anything?   
   
**Mordred:**   
...I was stupid for asking. Let's go, Mash, Fujimaru!   
   
**Mordred:**   
We'll go as fast as we can. Mash, carry Fujimaru. It's a race against time.   
   
**Mordred:**   
We can't slow down for a human. We'll head to the Yard at Servants' full speed.   
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right.... Senpai, excuse me for a bit.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't drop me.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Pleasure's mine.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I'll do everything I can not to drop you. Don't let go of my hand.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey, hurry up&mdash;Tch. There's the enemy already!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Multiple enemy responses, coming from all directions. Break through before they surround us!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
That's most of them! Forget the rest and just run, Mash!   
   
**Mash:**   
Right!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He fights pretty fiercely. I guess he really is the Treacherous Knight of legend.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, you're right. His combat powers match what's in the legend.   
   
**Mash:**   
He's swift and accurate, like a bolt of lighting flashing through the sky. You won't sense a shred of doubt in his blade.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Treacherous Knight?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You mean Mordred?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, come to think&mdash; I never gave Fujimaru a proper explanation.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mordred the Treacherous Knight has manifested here as a Saber class.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Of course, he's not from this era. He's from the Arthurian legends of the 5th and 6th century.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The one who brought upon its end. He literally betrayed King Arthur.   
   
**Mash:**   
It was no ordinary betrayal, either. He brought together all of Arthur's enemies, both domestic and foreign...  
   
**Mash:**   
...and became what we call the Treacherous King. In peaceful times, he could've been king himself.   
   
**Mash:**   
There are many stories of his own glory. He was originally a Knight of the Round Table&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And is said to be King Arthur's "son. "But there's also stories that the King didn't admit such.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Some say that's the reason for his betrayal. At the end, why did Mordred betray King Arthur?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Only he&mdash;no, she herself knows.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did the rebellion succeed?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Did the rebellion fail?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Mordred died during the battle on the Hill of Camlann.   
   
**Mash:**   
They killed each other. She fought King Arthur with the sword Clarent...  
   
**Mash:**   
...and King Arthur fought with a holy spear and pierced her through.   
   
**Mash:**   
King Arthur was fatally wounded as well and&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
What are you guys babbling about? Hurry up and let's go!   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, r-right!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's hurry!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Roger, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
They're attacking us while we run! They just keep coming!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Don't stop, Mash!   
   
**Mash:**   
Right...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry to interrupt while you're moving. I've got news from Da Vinci.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'll give you her analysis on Helter Skelter,that huge armored robot.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
She's still not finished,but according to what she's found so far...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
First, it's not a Golem. The video showed no traces of magecraft.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even if it's a pure machine...there's still many unknowns,except that it seems to be steam-operated.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It looks like technology that doesn't exist in our year of 2017.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It was made via some technology that was hidden, or perhaps lost&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's as if it's a product of some super-technology from a world that took a "different path" than our own.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Yeah.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...So, I guess you're running right now. It would make sense that you wouldn't answer.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's all I've got. Good luck, guys!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Jack the Ripper:**   
...Oh?   
   
**Jack the Ripper:**   
You came out here. All right. Hehe...what should we do?   
   
**Jack the Ripper:**   
Should we kill you? One, two, three, lots. Lots.   
   
**Jack the Ripper:**   
Hehe. We killed lots and lots,but we're still hungry. We're starving.   
   
**Jack the Ripper:**   
The police officers don't have much magical energy, you know.   
   
**Jack the Ripper:**   
So thanks for coming. We'll be full after we eat your magical energy.   
   
**Mordred:**   
We made it&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
No, I don't think we did. This smells of blood...the Yard's been wiped out, huh?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There are two moving responses there besides you. Jack the Ripper, and one more.   
   
**Mash:**   
We can assume it's an unknown Servant. You there&mdash;  
   
**H：???:**  
Yes. I'm a Caster Servant. I'm one of the leaders of the "Project" you know of.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Project Demonic Fog?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why are you doing this?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**H：???:**  
It's a complex set of circumstances, you see. Oh, please call me "P. "  
   
**"P":**  
Unfortunately, you're too late. Scotland Yard has been slaughtered to the last man.   
   
**"P":**  
They all died horribly. That girl has no compassion within her at all.   
   
**"P":**  
But it was necessary. A necessary sacrifice. That's all I can say.   
   
**"P":**  
Man is to be loved. Love and emotions are both noble, brilliant things.   
   
**"P":**  
But&mdash; How sad. Sometimes they pale in comparison to the greater good.   
   
**"P":**  
Something we need was kept inside Scotland Yard.   
   
**"P":**  
Figures the British Empire, home of the Mage's Association and the Clock Tower, would put a heavy magical seal on.   
   
**"P":**  
And so, sadly,they were in the way of our greater good.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Why do you mouth off like you actually know stuff? I could care less about love and emotions!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Yet again, you guys laid your hands on what's mine. You're no king. How dare you touch what belongs to a king!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A Heroic Spirit, killing innocent people?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Have you no pride as a hero?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**"P":**  
Yes, and so you see. I am so filled with sorrow I cannot control myself.   
   
**"P":**  
Humans, possessing emotion, should be sacred. Humans, filled with love, should be dazzling.   
   
**"P":**  
My power cannot save them. No, looking at the results, it could never save them.   
   
**"P":**  
Time is being incinerated. Humanity is being incinerated.   
   
**"P":**  
The march of civilization, emotions, love, are all disappearing. Only four more singularities remain in the world.   
   
**"P":**  
How sad. But neither you nor I can stop it.   
   
**"P":**  
No, if we could not stop it&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
...I feel a contradiction.   
   
**Mash:**   
A contradiction in your words when you speak of emotion. Caster, no, "P," who are you?   
   
**Mash:**   
You used Jack to take human lives. You're surely the one without compassion.   
   
**"P":**  
Yes, perhaps I am,beautiful young girl.   
   
**"P":**  
I am a mage, and a wicked and cruel one at that. Even now, I tell an innocent girl as follows:   
   
**"P":**  
Jack. You handle them.   
   
**"P":**  
Do what you like. They might be "your mother. "  
   
**Jack:**   
Huh? They...might?   
   
**Jack:**   
Oh, We see. Hmmm. Then we'll do to you what we do to Mommy, okay?   
   
**Jack:**   
Will you let us "go back? "Will you let us go inside you...inside Mommy...  
   
**Mordred:**   
No. You're going straight back to the Throne. I'll kill you here.   
   
**Mash:**   
I think we should stop Assassin here.... Senpai...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's stop her.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Prepare for combat.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Right, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jack:**   
Mo-mmy...No...No, no, noo...It hurts...  
   
**Jack:**   
Why...Why?   
   
**Jack:**   
...Why? Tell me...Please...Please?   
   
**"P":**  
Farewell, child who knows not love. I pray that someday you find the love you seek.   
   
**"P":**  
&mdash;Now then. I suppose I should die by your hands here as well.   
   
**"P":**  
The wicked mage is defeated by the heroes. That is one of the endings I seek.   
   
**"P":**  
But,I will first fulfill my duty.   
   
**"P":**  
Farewell, you heroes who would walk the bright path. You too, Knight of the Round Table&mdash;  
   
**"P":**  
I pray that you forever remain the "heroes" who defeat evil.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Wait! Aah, damn it! He disappeared! That's why I hate mages!   
   
**Mash:**   
Teleportation&mdash;If it wasn't caused by the use of a Command Spell, it's...  
   
**Mash:**   
It's a skill closer to True Magic. With the way he did it...A possibility is the Holy Grail...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's possible. He did say that he was one of the people behind Project Demonic Fog trying to destroy this era.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's also possible that the owner of the Holy Grail teleported him away as well.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What are they...What are they trying to do here in London?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Who cares? We'll find them and crush them.   
   
**"P":**  
...I have returned.   
   
**"B":**  
Sshhuu...Kkoohh...  
   
**"M":**  
Excellent work.... So that girl was defeated?   
   
**"P":**  
Unfortunately, she's dead. A second loss, after Mephistopheles.   
   
**"M":**  
The grand scheme remains unaffected. We need simply advance our "project. "  
   
**"P":**  
Yes, that's right. We are Servants. We obey our Master's words.   
   
**"P":**  
There is no need for regret. You just need to move ahead with your "project. "  
   
**"M":**  
...I know.   
   
**"B":**  
To pave the path for the world and civilization&mdash;That is our destiny as scholars.   
   
**"B":**  
But the world has been incinerated...Humanity and civilization are on the path to an unchangeable end.   
   
**"B":**  
We no longer&mdash;  
   
## Section 6: London Night   
   
**Andersen:**   
I'm glad to see you back. A shame about the officers at the Yard.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Rest for a little. I heard you haven't rested at all since your arrival, right?   
   
**Andersen:**   
Pushing yourself doesn't equate to good work. Be it writing or hunting for the Holy Grail, occasional breaks are needed.   
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you. But...there's no time.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Fool. Are you a workaholic, too? Can you not forget the weight of what you carry?   
   
**Andersen:**   
Then let me tell you a story to pass the time. A story of how Nursery Rhyme and I materialized.   
   
**Mash:**   
Um...you mean Alice, right? That's what she called herself...  
   
**Andersen:**   
No, Nursery Rhyme. You left for the Yard before I could tell you.   
   
**Andersen:**   
I didn't get to say this, but both Nursery Rhyme and I appeared "from the demonic fog. "  
   
**Andersen:**   
With no Master,and no summoning ritual, either.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah, so was I, come to think of it. Jekyll's no Master, and there was no summoning ritual.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I just woke up one moment in the fog. Huh, do Servants just naturally appear like that?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe they do.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, no, no! That's impossible!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If you can just appear...No, be summoned on your own,you're something way more powerful than a Servant!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't know about that...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, it's normally impossible.   
   
**Mash:**   
If you mean&mdash;naturally appearing Heroic Spirits,there aren't many, but there are a few such records.   
   
**Mash:**   
But when that happens,they don't have a personality of their own.   
   
**Mash:**   
When a Heroic Spirit appears as a Servant,they're always summoned from the Throne by a ritual.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Listen, in the other three eras we went to, the Servants were always summoned under the Grail's influence.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's absolutely impossible for a Servant to just appear on its own!   
   
**Andersen:**   
So the Servants aren't appearing from the fog, then? That leaves one possibility.   
   
**Andersen:**   
The fog was "created by the Holy Grail. "Or, what creates the fog is influenced by the Holy Grail.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's...what it would mean. That's the logical conclusion. No contradictions.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Logic applies to most things in the real world. About the only thing it doesn't apply to is love.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Use your imagination. Then, you'll anticipate most things, and sometimes even predict them.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Haha. Love? Like you'd know, you punk.   
   
**Andersen:**   
I don't want to hear that from a kid who doesn't even know love. I'm a virgin. I know all about love and romance.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...Huh? Hmm. Huh? That doesn't make sense, does it? Hmm?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't know, but those are amazing words.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hmm? It's true, it doesn't...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Have you forgotten? I am Andersen. My storytelling makes me a Caster Heroic Spirit.   
   
**Andersen:**   
If a swordsman's skills lie in battle, an author's skills lie in letters, words, indolence, pain, and love.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Be it improv poetry or a crazy deadline,a true author is capable of anything when serious.   
   
**Andersen:**   
I am a creative author. Not many can match me for imagination.   
   
**Andersen:**   
I won't lose a debate to an amateur. If you're not going to rest, go for a late-night patrol.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah. You're right! If we can nab that "P"and make him talk, we can end this.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I'm going for a patrol then. I'll take a walk to the edge of the city area.   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, Senpai...Mordred is about to leave.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's follow.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's better to act than do nothing.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right!   
   
**Jekyll:**   
You're good at manipulating people, huh? But thanks, they were under a lot of strain.   
   
**Andersen:**   
It's nothing compared to writing a moving story.   
   
**Andersen:**   
I just had to "motivate" them.... But I don't understand.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Hmm?   
   
**Andersen:**   
What I showed them may be an illusion. A wisp within a match light. Logical or not, it's no different from a fantasy.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
You just used your imagination, right? So&mdash;  
   
**Andersen:**   
Don't be stupid. That was just a "play" on words.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...It feels strange to do a patrol with a bunch of people.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I always did it on my own. Well, this makes it easier,so I don't mind...Oh, there's some already.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I just can't match Mordred for speed. I see them too. Enemy responses!   
   
**Mash:**   
Roger. Master, your orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
There were quite a few. Whew.   
   
**Mash:**   
You must be tired. Do you need to rest?   
   
**Mordred:**   
No, there were just so many of them. It would be different if there had been a Helter Skelter.   
   
**Mordred:**   
It's quite strong. It's probably the only enemy I've enjoyed fighting during this materialization.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash and Fujimaru have only encountered it once. It was a tough opponent.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Maybe there aren't that many of them? Come to think,you covered a lot of ground but haven't seen any.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah...Come to think, I've never seen big groups of them.   
   
**Mordred:**   
If possible, I'd like to go up against a tough enemy. I hope we'll see one tonight.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Now that you've said it, we will.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're jinxing us.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, you think so?   
   
**Mash:**   
Why don't we go on a bit further? There is still some distance to the City's edge.   
   
**Mash:**   
Um, well, I'm confirming map information...It's not like I'm particularly familiar with London.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Well, if something turns up, we'll deal with it then.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Hmph, more gutless enemies.   
   
**Mash:**   
All enemies destroyed. No, I don't think they were as easy to defeat as you say...  
   
**Mordred:**   
If the fog makes Servants appear,I want it to toss out a strong one.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh...But you know. What if what comes out isn't necessarily an enemy?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Right. In fact, you've been helping us. Same goes for Andersen.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But, Nursery Rhyme and Jack were enemies. Both were likely Servants that materialized from the Demonic Fog, too.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I'd like to occasionally see an enemy that faces me head-on, instead of all these guys that attack from behind.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Indeed.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Right? You're quite a perceptive Master.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sneak attacks are good too.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...You really think so?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, let's continue patrolling. It's only a little bit further to the edge of the City.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Come at me! Strong enemies!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Well then&mdash;who is it that doth summon me!? I, Caster Shakespeare, travelled with great haste to the city of fog.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Or so I wish to say to you. But it seems that I was not summoned to participate in a Holy Grail War this time.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
This is quite vexing indeed. O God! Where dost lie the grand story that I am destined to behold?   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
No reply. Silence. God hast forsaken me. Where art the tale making blood boil, flesh dance, heart shiver, and soul shake!   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Then, I can only utter these words. Oh, "Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind! "  
   
**Mordred:**   
...This is a blank. Next.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Ah, what have we here? How curious our paths should finally cross within this unfathomable fog!   
   
**Mash:**   
Do you know him? This, uh...Caster Shakespeare guy?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Never heard of him. He's a blank.   
   
**Mordred:**   
But we just confirmed our theory. Right now, this guy materialized from the Demonic Fog.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
It is a tragedy that my Master does not exist. But, I was able to meet you. Surely this too is destiny.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I shall weave a tale of your exploits. I pray that your tale shall live up to your reputation.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Ugh...  
   
**Mordred:**   
This guy&mdash;doesn't look like an enemy. It's kind of odd if you think about it.   
   
**Mordred:**   
What's the difference between him and the likes of Jack or that clown? Jack aside, everyone moved on their own will.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Also&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
Never mind. Wait. What, did this night patrol hit the jackpot?   
   
**Mash:**   
What?   
   
**Mordred:**   
He's here. The one we've been waiting for. Hey you! You got some nerve for someone who fled!   
   
**"P":**  
...Looks like I am late.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's "P! "  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Just when did he...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**"P":**  
How unfortunate. It seems you have already procured the Servant that newly materialized.   
   
**"P":**  
He appears to be a Caster. If only we had procured him, he would have made a fine ally.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Hah hah. I get it. It's really quite simple when you reveal the trick.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Now I understand as well.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So, you procure and round up Servants materializing from the Demonic Fog, and make them your allies.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see. Logically it's simple. But, easier said than done.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Unless you have the Holy Grail, it's impossible to make Heroic Spirits move according to your will.   
   
**"P":**  
&mdash;Correct. I confess as much. It is as you say.   
   
**"P":**  
We continue to wait in London for those who are indispensable to us to manifest themselves.   
   
**"P":**  
So, we procure Heroic Spirits materializing from the fog one by one, and "adjust" them so they work on expanding the fog.   
   
**"P":**  
It is truly regrettable indeed that we were not able to procure all of you.   
   
**"P":**  
We surely would have been fine friends. All of us.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I doubt it.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're kidding me.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, Senpai. I feel exactly the same as you do.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Hah! Seriously. You'll have to allow me to pass on that!   
   
**Mordred:**   
You won't get away this time! Mage, name yourself before I cut you down!   
   
**"P":**  
&mdash;As you wish. There is no catalyst to transport at this time. I shall procure you here myself.   
   
**"P":**  
I am Paracelsus von Hohenheim. I manipulate the Four Great Elementals, and I seek the True Ether.   
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Of course...I possess a different objective at the moment.   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, prepare for a battle between Servants! Your orders&mdash;!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...A most natural result.   
   
**Paracelsus:**   
This is precisely what I'd expect from a sword-wielding hero. Naturally, evildoers must fall.   
   
**Paracelsus:**   
Overcoming all the world's evils. Resisting all this world's greed.   
   
**Paracelsus:**   
And you who will carve out the future of this world. May the path before you...  
   
**Paracelsus:**   
...be somehow illuminated...By true...light...  
   
**Mash:**   
...I have confirmed termination of the enemy Servant. Victory is ours, Senpai.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Damn. The idiot disappeared without a trace. He was a nauseating mage from beginning to end.   
   
**Mordred:**   
"Carve out the future? " Give me a break. As if I'm the type to do that. Ugh.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
"Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player. "  
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh? What was that?   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
It's nothing but a few fanciful phrases crossing my mind. It is quite a fine spectacle that you have shown me today.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I was only able to behold the mage in a short role,but he provided a truly satisfying final act.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...What an idiot. You're just being delusional.   
   
## Section 7: One More Mystery   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai&mdash;Are you okay? You seem a little pale.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sleepy.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's so early in the morning.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I suppose so. But early-morning patrols are necessary.   
   
**Mash:**   
Mordred's actions are not mistaken. What happened last night may very well happen again.   
   
**Mash:**   
However, it's not ideal...If you are starting to feel excessive fatigue...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm fine.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't worry so much.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Okay.   
   
**Mordred:**   
It's pretty inconvenient to be a Master. But I guess you live with it, as you're still human.   
   
**Mordred:**   
All the enemies are pushovers anyway. I could handle them myself&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
...Mechanical sounds detected. There's a big one approaching!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, speak of the devil. Hah, maybe I'll finally get to fight a Helter Skelter!   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry, Master! Preparing for battle! Your orders, please!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I've got bad news for you. Sorry, but listen up. Right around where you are...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, can you hear them now? Well, that's what I'm talking about.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Great, bring it on! I'll crush as many as I need to! It's pretty great slashing my way through thick steel.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm really, really sorry Master! Entering consecutive battles! Your orders, please.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
...You know, even I'm getting kind of tired.   
   
**Mordred:**   
We should make our way back to Jekyll's apartment. I don't need sleep, but I want to recover my magical energy.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ahhh...Umm, this is kind of hard to say, but...  
   
**Mordred:**   
...I know, I know, so just shut up. I already sense them. There's quite a few.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Mechanical sounds detected. Multiple large units! Predicting enemy count will further increase!   
   
**Mordred:**   
I wish they would all just congregate in Hyde Park! Then, I'd turn them all to cinders with my Noble Phantasm!   
   
**Mash:**   
Please restrain yourself. Massive firepower in the City area is dangerous!   
   
**Mordred:**   
I'll be as careful as I can when I use it!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go!   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This is getting more and more fun!   
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I guess the enemy's getting serious now that a leader's down! Bring it on&mdash;I'll fight to the finish!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jekyll:**   
...I see. So that's what's been happening.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Anyway, good work. Glad you made it back. Now please get some rest.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Ah...That's much better...Ahhh...  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Sitting on my favorite sofa again...Well...Okay fine. You did put in a lot of effort both last night and just now.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Dead tired.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wiped out.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, don't overdo it. Please rest up. From now on, I'll watch over your vitals, too.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? That's actually my job...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
B-But you're right. It's more pleasing to be looked after by someone close to you...  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Still, I see...I didn't think mass production of Helter Skelters was possible before, but now the situation is dire.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
It's likely due to us defeating the mage Paracelsus AKA"P," one of the three leaders of Project Demonic Fog.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
The enemy recognized you as a threat, and built up their strength in order to obtain materialized Heroic Spirits.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
We should think of it that way. But, I wonder what kind of Heroic Spirit they're seeking...  
   
**Mordred:**   
I don't know. It's your job to do the thinking. I'm...exhausted.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...That's right. Speaking of thinking, there's a freeloader who's only good for thinking. Hell, we got two of 'em.   
   
**Mordred:**   
What are they doing right now, Jekyll? They're in the study, right?   
   
**Andersen:**   
You called?   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Did you summon us?   
   
**Mordred:**   
...Sigh. I'm totally going to regret this. I should've known better. It's like you guys opened the Ark or something.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Ark? Do you mean that "Ark? "Hahaha, you are harsh indeed! What an exaggeration!   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I do call myself a jack-in-the-box that releases grand, flowery words when cracked open...  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...but I am no match for that cache of calamities! Rather, such a box does not exist to begin with.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Indeed, it doesn't exist. It can't exist. As you know, its intended use is an impossibility.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Nothing spoils fun like anecdotes of opening a box ending the world. The message is, if you want to die, die alone.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, Senpai.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Let's not talk about the Ark.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I agree. Despite what they say, those two are obviously into it.   
   
**Mash:**   
I think the best thing to do is keep quiet.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No, the Ark does exist. I know for sure.   
   
**Andersen & Shakespeare:**   
Seriously!?   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Mm? Oh, I do apologize. Young Andersen incited me into raising my voice.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
But that aside, Fujimaru,I am verily interested in what you were just saying!   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Where and when did you see that Ark!? And who in the world opened it and for what reason!?   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Specifically, in what way did the ultimate bad ending overflowed with both sorrow and farce!?   
   
**Andersen:**   
...Hmm. (←listening calmly)  
   
**Andersen:**   
...Hmm. (←silently beginning to prepare tea)  
   
**Andersen:**   
...Hmm. (←spreading jam on a scone)  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Fool. You aroused a cat's curiosity. I know not of this.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Fujimaru, Mash. Go talk in the study until they're satisfied.   
   
**Mash:**   
Bummer...  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Good luck. Maybe you can count that as part of resting up?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Ha! Do you think you can take a nap in front a pond of geese? Look at Fujimaru's face. I've never seen anyone so dumbfounded.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Andersen:**   
Oh, that's right. I forgot to tell you what it is that we're doing.   
   
**Andersen:**   
That playwright is focused on getting these events down on paper, but not me. I want to do as little work as possible.   
   
**Andersen:**   
But there is something on my mind. I heard from Fujimaru of the developments leading up to now...The seven Singularities.   
   
**Andersen:**   
...More precisely, something about the magecraft ritual called the Holy Grail War bothers me...  
   
**Andersen:**   
...I don't have enough materials to make a judgment. To be honest, I'm almost at a stalemate.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...Hmph. I see you can act like a Caster. Although you're still useless...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah, excuse me. Can we get back on topic? A review of the current situation, and future plans?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Luckily, enemy's awareness is focusing on the Demonic Fog. If they want to wipe us out, they'd go around destroying buildings.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The fact that they haven't means the enemy is only aware of the streets that the Demonic Fog extends to.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm sure there's something there to take advantage of&mdash;  
   
**Jekyll:**   
...Is there?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I hope so. Hmm...Is there? I hope there is...It'd be nice...  
   
**Mordred:**   
This is a pain, do something. We can't spend as much time outside like we used to.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Wandering around aimlessly just eats away at my magical energy with each battle.   
   
**Mordred:**   
If we could at least disable the Helter Skelters,it wouldn't be that much of an effort, but...  
   
**Jekyll:**   
There's no way. This is a problem, as we might end up in a stalemate.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Urhh......Uhh, urhh...  
   
**Andersen:**   
All right, then how about this?   
   
**Andersen:**   
There is an outbreak of Helter Skelters, but how about gathering some data to support my theory?   
   
**Andersen:**   
Run an errand for me, basically. You guys have stamina, so isn't this the perfect job?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Working outside among all those Helter Skelters is a tall order...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's try it.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's cooperate with Andersen and Shakespeare.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai. It won't make our current situation any better but&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't think things will get any better if we just stay holed up in this apartment.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, if there is anything we can do,getting on it would be constructive.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Still, you want us to gather data,but where are we supposed to go?   
   
**Fou:**   
Kyu, fouuu...  
   
**Andersen:**   
Oh, come on, this is London. Your destination is obvious.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Obvious?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm, what is it?   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Maybe the Mage's Association&mdash;AKA "Clock Tower? "  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Does he mean the Mage's Association?   
   
**Andersen:**   
Correct. Once man enters AD, mages centered around a giant academy&mdash;the Mage's Association, Clock Tower.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah!   
   
**Andersen:**   
Right. A giant academy that is unlocking the secrets of the world exists here in London. Why would you not use it?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You're right...B-But in the state London is in now, I wonder...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If the Mage's Association&mdash;Clock Tower still stands,I'd naturally assume Jekyll is in contact with them.   
   
**Mash:**   
Good point. Jekyll hasn't spoken about the Clock Tower.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
...That's because there was no need.   
   
**Mordred:**   
The Mage's Association...That's like underground, from Regent Park all the way to Westminster, right?   
   
**Mordred:**   
After materializing and meeting Jekyll,I went there to check it out immediately.   
   
**Mordred:**   
The British Museum, was it? I went there because I heard that's where the entrance was.   
   
**Mordred:**   
But the entrance was completely sealed off. It was a ruined pile of rubble.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Yeah. Strangely enough, "the building was demolished. "No part was left untouched.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Thinking back, perhaps the mastermind of "Project Demonic Fog" crushed all possibility of resistance.   
   
**Andersen:**   
I don't mind if it got destroyed. So what if it's a pile of rubbles.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Nothing could be better if the mages are alive, but that has nothing to do with my objective one way or another.   
   
**Andersen:**   
What I need are records. Data.   
   
**Andersen:**   
It's certain that the important archives are protected by considerably firm seals. Take me there.   
   
**Fou:**   
Kyuuu...Fou...  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Then I shall accompany you. The ruins of a mystic academy should serve as a font of inspiration!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It seems this is going to be a large group. But...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I suppose the more firepower the better, in case you encounter Helter Skelters. Yeah, that makes sense.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uhh......Urhh?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You should stay here, Fran.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's dangerous, so hold the fort, Fran.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I agree. Right now, London is especially dangerous. Please stay here, Fran.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh, urrh...  
   
**Andersen:**   
Then let's be off. We'll visit that formerly flourishing mystic academy.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Oh, and also Saber...Do make sure to protect us weak Casters.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh? Protect you? Say that to Shieldy over there.   
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, u-um&mdash;  
   
**Jekyll:**   
All right, I'm going, too! Let's go!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh?   
   
**Mash:**   
Wha...  
   
## Section 8: The Death of the Mage's Association   
   
**Mordred:**   
...You know. You said "a large group,"but we can't count you in during combat.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
You're looking for the ruins of the Mage's Association,yes? Surely my intellectual curiosity as a scholar will be aroused.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Besides, I can be good when need to. You see, I also have an "ace up my sleeve. "  
   
**Jekyll:**   
And I have faith that you'll all protect me. I'm counting on you, Saber.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Tch. As I said, I'm not protecting anyone. But do as you like.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All right then. We really should get moving. The British Museum means we're heading to the Regent Park area.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's some distance from here. You'd best prepare yourselves for a succession of battles.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mmm? Come to think of it&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Didn't the Mage's Association exist as several college towns in the London suburbs and stuff?   
   
**Jekyll:**   
That's that. This is this.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
The Mage's Association originated at their London HQ,and added facilities centuries later as they grew in scale.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
That's why interspersed college towns center around London, as it's the heart of Mage's Association and Clock Tower.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Multiple cities built to surround London comprise the rest of the Association.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Doctor, have you never been to the Clock Tower before?   
   
**Andersen:**   
Oh. I knew there was something unpolished about you. Are you a country bumpkin?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Gulp. N-No, of course not.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's just that I haven't had much connection to London,I mean, being so far away...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
B-But I knew what was going on in London! Director Marie was sent from the Mage's Association, too!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Enough chatter. We need to&mdash;Ah, as soon as I think it. Here we go.   
   
**Mash:**   
Multiple machine sounds ahead. Senpai, I think the Helter Skelters are here!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They didn't waste any time. Fight your way through them and get to Regent Park on the double!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Roger.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go right through them!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
The British Museum! A symbol of the British Empire! Or rather, what remains&mdash;  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Oh, what a sorrowful sight! This museum once held so many of humanity's greatest treasures!   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I cannot help but sigh. This building once held human progress itself.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Can such a thing be allowed! Oh! 'Tis like the burning of the Library of Alexandria!   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Truly, a shame&mdash;  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
However, however. This is the way of humanity as well.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Foolishness and grieving are human traits. "You, gods, will give us some faults to make us men. "  
   
**Mordred:**   
...It's no different than the last time I was here. Rubble. Ruin. Nothing else.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Whoever destroyed this place must've had a personal grudge. There's no survivors.   
   
**Mash:**   
So this is the British Museum...or what's left. I'd seen it, but just in image data...  
   
**Mash:**   
Nowhere else in London were buildings destroyed. Just here...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's sad.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't like destroyed buildings.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai...Yes...  
   
**Andersen:**   
All right, physical laborers. Oh, especially Saber and Mash Kyrielight.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes.   
   
**Mordred:**   
What?   
   
**Andersen:**   
Start digging here. According to Jekyll,the Clock Tower spread underground as well.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Despite the thorough wreckage, the ground is intact. That means what we're after is underground.   
   
**Andersen:**   
But, unfortunately, the stairs are buried in rubble. So&mdash;You see?   
   
**Andersen:**   
Time to show off the ridiculous strength of Servants! Now go smash stuff like a bulldozer!   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
That's true! Sadly, I expend tremendous magical energy if I hold anything heavier than a pen!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
   
**Mordred:**   
...  
   
**Jekyll:**   
I-I'll help. Yeah. I probably won't be of much use though.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yay! I'm faster this time! Magical energy responses near you! And lots of them!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Hmm...It's true. There's something here. What is this?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You don't see anything, right? But it's there. And it's moving around.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's not the Mystic Codes scattered in the rubble, either. Which means there's only one answer!   
   
**Jekyll:**   
It's from below!? Saber, sorry, but get ready&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
Don't treat me like you're my Master! I know! If they come out, we'll fight them!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, multiple incoming enemies! Magical energy signatures are growing&mdash;Assume they're attacking!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fight!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Be careful!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Master. Beginning combat!   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I shall aid you as well. A shield maiden dancing amidst the rubble&mdash;truly stimulates the imagination!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Battle is over, Senpai. Good work.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I don't see Helter Skelters around,but we still ran into something troublesome...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Those were...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I remember that shape.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai. The enemy has a striking resemblance to the magical tome we saw in Soho.   
   
**Mash:**   
But this time our attacks worked...Without Andersen giving them a name.   
   
**Mash:**   
Normal attacks alone were sufficient. They also didn't change form...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Last time I was here, I didn't see any floating books like that.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
May I speak? This is just a guess,but I think those are a type of transformed grimoire.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Maybe the Demonic Fog transformed the tomes that were kept underground with the Mage's Association.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Oh...I was thinking the same thing, but he said it first...)  
   
**Andersen:**   
...A swarm of attacking books, huh?   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
...It was like a nightmare, or perhaps a vision of hell.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Don't be stupid. Those things weren't even...  
   
**Andersen:**   
...  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
......  
   
**Mordred:**   
Haha. What's wrong, authors? You're not running your mouths like usual?   
   
**Andersen:**   
...I'm holding back. No, forget it. Forget it! Wow, that felt good! That felt great!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Hmm?   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
To burn a book! It is something inconceivable! Oh, how sad...but there was a joy in it!   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Wrongdoings that should ne'er be done. Unforgivable acts of barbarism! There should only be sadness, yet...  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I cannot help but feel a moment of forbidden joy! Oh, my God!   
   
**Andersen:**   
No books are needed except my own. Actually, I'd prefer to even burn my own works!   
   
**Andersen:**   
If there were no books in the world! No need to lament of the many great works I'll never read!   
   
**Andersen:**   
If there were no books in the world! I'd never have to scream, "Who published this trash!? "  
   
**Andersen:**   
If there were no books in the world! I'd never have to worry about deadlines!   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
What an honest man! Oh, but his words strike me in my heart!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fo, fooou...  
   
**Mordred:**   
W-What's gotten into them?   
   
**Jekyll:**   
This is kind of amazing...Really...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Authors are twisted.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Authors are creatures of paradox?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A-Anyway, Senpai. This makes our path clear, doesn't it?   
   
**Mash:**   
When the book-type enemies appeared,they formed a path to the underground by chance&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. Once the author Heroic Spirits calm down,it's time to go underground!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm so excited. This is like the headquarters of the Mage's Association.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I wonder what it's like down there? Oh, I wish I could go and see for myself.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Then you should come. Instead of just being a voice.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I-I...um...I have to observe, and keep Chaldea running...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
O-Okay! Back to my observation work!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, Kyukyu...  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Jekyll:**   
...It's like an endless dungeon, huh?   
   
**Andersen:**   
It's dark.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Indeed, and the air is awfully wet.   
   
**Mordred:**   
That's what mage dwellings are like, right? Everybody knows they like it dark and damp.   
   
**Mash:**   
Do they?   
   
**Fou:**   
Kyuu, kyaau! Fou!   
   
**Mordred:**   
The rodent is agreeing with me. It says this sure feels like where a mage lives. Right?   
   
**Fou:**   
Kyuu!   
   
**Mash:**   
Fou? You seem kind of excited...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Does he feel something?   
   
**Fou:**   
Kyukyu...Kyaau...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He really is agreeing with Mordred.   
   
**Fou:**   
Kyuu, kyaau! Kyuu!   
   
**Mash:**   
That's right. I wonder if Fou has taken a liking to Mordred.   
   
**Fou:**   
Foou...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The endless dark corridors might be because, well, we're choosing to walk down corridors not blocked by debris.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All the entrances to the rooms are smashed,or filled with rubble...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It feels like someone destroyed this place thoroughly. There's not a single surviving mage.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If that theory's correct, the enemy should have sent someone down here. And they&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
They might still be here, huh? Looks like you're right.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**Mash:**   
Magical energy response detected! Senpai, something's around the corner!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Time for combat!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This is a closed area, so be careful!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Roger, Master!   
   
**Andersen:**   
Hmmph. I'll help you this time. Don't expect it all the time, though.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Mr. Andersen. This door is&mdash;  
   
**Andersen:**   
I'm sensing magical energy. Yeah, this is it. A warded entrance to a library.   
   
**Andersen:**   
It's not blocked with rubble either. Excellent. I hope what I'm after is here, but that's up to chance.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Saber, Mash Kyrielight,and Fujimaru.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Jekyll and I are going inside. Guard the door.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Roger.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Leave it to us!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Find what you're after quickly and get back here. I'm not sure when the enemy might show&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
...And there they are now! Flying books, and even a Helter Skelter!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Multiple moving responses! Th-This is not good!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They're rushing in one after another. Can't assess the total amount! Andersen, escape once you find the reference you're after!   
   
**Andersen:**   
Oh...I don't know about that. This is a problem.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
This is...This is indeed a problem...I see. So that's how they guard the books.   
   
**Mordred:**   
What? Stop being pompous and tell us what's going on!   
   
**Jekyll:**   
The library books are warded by special, powerful spells. They can't leave this room! We can't go through the door!   
   
**Andersen:**   
Luckily, I have several good guesses for the references I seek. But, oh...These are...  
   
**Andersen:**   
..."Wait a while for me to finish reading them. "  
   
**Mordred:**   
WHAT!?   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
One scans information deep in the mystic garden! The other guards the door against a horde of foes!   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
On one side, a battle of knowledge! On another, a battle of strength!   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
This is truly a situation that entrances one's heart!   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Oh, which side should I stand on? Which should I see, that I can record in a book!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Just shut up and fight over here! They're coming!   
   
**Mash:**   
...This is a defensive battle! Master, your orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
That's most of 'em&mdash;No, wait. There's more?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There's more! The layout down here puts you at a huge disadvantage!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The enemy's just going to keep coming! And you have to defend a single point!   
   
**Mash:**   
We're okay for now, but if this drags out it'll be bad. Master!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We can't leave yet!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Just hang in a little more!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Roger, Master! Continuing battle!   
   
**Andersen:**   
Just a little more, Fujimaru! I'm at the best part. It's all for nothing if we leave now.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Badly outnumbered! The ideal situation for a hero,but this is&mdash;  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
This is perhaps a bit too many. I'm about to run out of magical energy. Actually, I already have.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Wha&mdash;  
   
**Jekyll:**   
...Oh, fine. I wanted to avoid this if I could, but...  
   
**Mordred:**   
&mdash;Huh? Jekyll, why are you coming out into the hall?   
   
**Mordred:**   
There's nothing a would-be mage can do here! Get back in the library!   
   
**Jekyll:**   
I told you. I have an ace-in-the-hole.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?   
   
**Mash:**   
Jekyll, that's&mdash;  
   
**Jekyll:**   
An elixir. A "special" one I made. First you do this...and then inject it...like this...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wh-What!? A strange magical energy response suddenly spawned there!?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fo&ndash;u! Kyau!   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Haha&mdash;  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Hehehe, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! It's been so long since I've been outside! HERE I AM!!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh!?   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!!?!?!?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who are you?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Jekyll?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, that was Mr. Jekyll...Mr. Henry Jekyll! But the way he changed is "just like in the book"...  
   
**Hyde:**   
I'm "Hyde! " If I don't like you, I kill you! You get in my way, I kill you! Kill! Kill! Kill!   
   
**Hyde:**   
HYAHAHAHAHAHAH! I'LL KILL YOU, HELTER SKELTER&ndash;!   
   
**Mordred:**   
...He ran right at the enemy. He's just like a Berserker. Not bad!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Elixir-induced transformation. I see, truly Jekyll and Hyde! But physical transformation must put an awful strain on him!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I don't think it'll last long...Andersen, you better hurry up!   
   
**Andersen:**   
I understand. Don't hurry me.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Reading should be done at one's own pace. Yes, alone, and in a quiet room&mdash;  
   
**Andersen:**   
Hmm. It's not quiet. The noise outside is bothering me.   
   
**Mordred:**   
You don't understand at all! Just hurry up!   
   
**Mordred:**   
...Damn it. Shieldy, we'll follow Jekyll!   
   
**Mash:**   
Right. &mdash;Senpai!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Work together and don't go too deep!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't let Hyde get away!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Roger, Master! Continuing combat!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Enemy units destroyed!   
   
**Jekyll:**   
...We're done, huh? Whew, I don't think...I can do anymore...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, you're back to normal.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
There was a chance I wouldn't come back, so I'm glad I did. Is Andersen's book-reading&mdash;  
   
**Andersen:**   
I'm done. I finished decoding most of the documents I was after.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Besides, there were also several interesting books. I satisfied my personal curiosity, too. Great work, guys.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Personal curiosity?   
   
**Fou:**   
...Fou......Fo...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What a free spirit Andersen is...There's something impressive in his lack of shame. However...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Y-You need to get out of here! There are more enemies coming!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Break away, Mash!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Good work. Let's get out of here.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai. Let's return to the surface right away.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Once again, good work. Let's return to the apartment and I'll share the results.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
&mdash;Okay! I've recovered! Now it's time for me to rejoin the heroes' battle as well!   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Oh? Are you all ready to return home?   
   
**Mordred:**   
That's right! We're leaving, damn it!   
   
**Andersen:**   
And so you see&mdash;Your efforts have answered a certain question.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Again, you have my thanks. Thank you, Fujimaru, Mash, Saber.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Y-Yeah.   
   
**Andersen:**   
My wallet is so empty I can't reward you a single penny,but I hope these observations are worth it.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Yes, I'm looking forward to them, Mr. Andersen. Enough to forget all this muscle pain.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.   
   
**Andersen:**   
In light of Mr. Jekyll's urgent need for rest,I'll get right to the point.   
   
**Andersen:**   
What bothered me in the first place was the relationship between "Heroic Spirits" and "Servants. "  
   
**Andersen:**   
Heroic Spirits are records or results of human history.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Be they real or fictional,they'll exist as long as humanity does.   
   
**Andersen:**   
But a Servant is something different. This treats a Heroic Spirit as an "existence" in reality...  
   
**Andersen:**   
A familiar given a container called a Class and "made real," when its existence is uncertain to begin with.   
   
**Andersen:**   
But I ask you, Jekyll and Roman, was it? Is such a thing possible with the powers of a human, a mage?   
   
**Andersen:**   
Turning a Heroic Spirit into a familiar&mdash;I see,that's powerful. The strongest summoning spell imaginable.   
   
**Andersen:**   
But a human couldn't handle such a spell on their own. If it's possible, it would be&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A being greater than humans. An "Authority" exercised by a supernatural being, labeled as world or god. Is that it?   
   
**Andersen:**   
Indeed. Heroic Spirits can't be summoned with human power alone. There needs to be some other reason&mdash;  
   
**Andersen:**   
It needs an extra push from something else, I think.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Um. Isn't that the Holy Grail?   
   
**Mash:**   
It's a fact that up to this point, many Servants have been summoned thanks to the Holy Grail.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Indeed. You spoke of the seven Singularities. Seven Holy Grails driving the different eras mad.   
   
**Andersen:**   
That's why I asked Dr. Roman about the Holy Grail.   
   
**Andersen:**   
What exactly is the Holy Grail War that enables Heroic Spirit Summons? For what reason was it created?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yup. I don't have detailed data, but the origin is a town in rural Japan. The flaming city you visited, Fujimaru.   
   
**Andersen:**   
There, they made a vessel for the Holy Grail, used its power to summon Heroic Spirits, who they had compete as Servants.   
   
**Andersen:**   
That's what seemed weird to me. There's a flaw in the concept of making Heroic Spirits fight each other.   
   
**Andersen:**   
It felt like there was something else going on. So I decided to read the Mage's Association archives.   
   
**Andersen:**   
And I found what I expected.   
   
**Andersen:**   
The original Heroic Spirit summoning ritual was a ceremony to pit seven powers against one.   
   
**Andersen:**   
It wasn't something where seven Heroic Spirits fought one another.   
   
**Andersen:**   
"Ritual: Heroic Spirit Summon" and "Ritual: Holy Grail War" are the same systems with different genres, you could say.   
   
**Andersen:**   
"Holy Grail War" altered an existing spell and used it for selfish human purposes.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Meanwhile, it's base spell "Heroic Spirit Summon"...  
   
**Andersen:**   
...was a ritual to put "humanity's strongest seven Heroic Spirits" against "a single powerful enemy. "  
   
**Andersen:**   
That's what got distorted in the Fuyuki Holy Grail War.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Then you and the others are also?   
   
**Andersen:**   
Yeah. Since there are only supposed to be seven of them, all the Heroic Spirits that got summoned later&mdash;  
   
**Andersen:**   
Well, they're cheap, convenient,multi-purpose familiars.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...So um...What?   
   
**Andersen:**   
...For now, just know that the Ritual: Holy Grail War was based off of something else.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm, I see! I see! An interesting theory.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Chaldea wasn't able to make its own summoning system from the ground up.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We modified and stabilized the Fuyuki ritual,but never considered the possibility of an older original.   
   
**Fou:**   
Foou!   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Doctor. This is a viewpoint we've never heard before.   
   
**Mash:**   
It casts doubt about the fundamental nature of the Holy Grail War.   
   
**Mash:**   
I thought I knew what Heroic Spirits were originally. But it was nothing more than information&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
It wasn't nearly at the level of what you just pointed out. That's very impressive, Mr. Andersen.   
   
**Mash:**   
I guess this is the keen eye of observation owned by an author that left his name in history.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Maybe so.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What you'd call an objective perspective?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
I don't know if it's that special. Anyway...That's fine, but you know...  
   
**Mordred:**   
This doesn't help us do anything about the mass-production of those Helter Skelters.   
   
**Mash:**   
Th...That's...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Well, that's true.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Of course it is. I just felt a hitch with the Heroic Spirit summoning system.   
   
**Andersen:**   
If we're all normal Classes summoned by a single system&mdash;  
   
**Andersen:**   
I wondered what kind of Spirit Origins the original seven for this system must have had.   
   
**Andersen:**   
...And someone else thought the same thing.   
   
**Andersen:**   
I don't think it's coincidence that information about this,even the parts you'd expect to be lost, was all in one place.   
   
**Andersen:**   
"Someone" predicted our coming,and put it there.   
   
**Mash:**   
Someone?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Who could it be? A surviving mage of the Clock Tower? Or a Servant?   
   
**Andersen:**   
I don't think it would be a mage, but I don't know why a Servant would do it. We'll have to set that aside for now.   
   
## Section 9: Opportunity   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Hm...It seems I'm picking up interference on my mic,but speak of the devil? I detect multiple hostiles around you.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There are more roaming around the apartment than earlier...Enough magical energy distortion to disturb communications.   
   
**Mash:**   
This mechanical sound&mdash;I believe it's a group of Helter Skelters.   
   
**Andersen:**   
I doubt they'll break in, but they are a nuisance. Get out there and dismantle them.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's do it!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'll finish them off quickly.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai. Intercepting them in the alley. Let's reduce their numbers.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...Good work. We drove off the Helter Skelters.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mmm. Mmm? Wait...Hold on a second, um...So that means...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&mdash;Helter Skelters?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes. That's it! Actually, I've made progress on the Helter Skelter analysis!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As expected, they're machines created by technology unknown to us. I suspect they were built&ndash;with magical energy.   
   
**Mash:**   
You mean...machines created with a combination of magecraft and science?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Not exactly. They are made by magical energy, but they are machines.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I still don't understand the kind of techniques used but structurally, they're machines. Yet, they were formed by magecraft.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
In other words...Um...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What do you mean?   
   
**Jekyll:**   
I don't really understand...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe like Noble Phantasms?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Exactly! Good insight!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...In other words, they're armaments made of magical energy, just like Servants' Noble Phantasms, right?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. They're half-baked mechanical constructions,which is why I was looking too hard for magecraft-made golem approximations.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Basically, they're Noble Phantasms. Powerful figures woven from magical energy.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Unlike a sword Noble Phantasm that is a "razor edge,"Helter Skelters are "fighting machine" Noble Phantasms.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It looks like they operate autonomously, but they're actually controlled by someone like the Noble Phantasm's owner.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They're a remote-controlled robotic squad, so to say. All units should stop if we break the acting controller.   
   
**Mash:**   
Then, considerable exceptions aside, if we beat the Servant possessing the Noble Phantasm&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
The robots will disappear. Well, we can see the whole picture now, huh?   
   
**Mash:**   
So Doctor,where is the Servant who owns the Noble Phantasm?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I don't know.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
...Yes. Right, you wouldn't know.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Not even Da Vinci knows, or rather, she said she can't clean up my mess anymore...  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Mmm?   
   
**Mordred:**   
What, someone else did the analysis?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Uuh, that's right...After all, I wasn't getting anywhere on my own...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm a medical staff...Considering that, don't you think I'm doing pretty well?   
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes. You're making a great effort, Doctor. Right, Senpai?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Thank you, thank you...Fujimaru...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where the Servant with the Noble Phantasm is...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Uuh...I feel so lonely...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uhh......Uh, uh, uhrrr...  
   
**Mordred:**   
We know what we have to do. Yes. But, we don't know our destination. Do we?   
   
**Fran:**   
...Urh...  
   
**Mordred:**   
What should we do? If we could trace the magical energy in one shot...  
   
**Mash:**   
If the example of a remote control is correct,then maybe we can trace the magical energy back.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Da Vinci, wise in the ways of science and magecraft,brought up that example, so I imagine it's right.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But with the effect of the Demonic Fog, doing something subtle like tracing marks of magical energy...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Is not something I can do. It's rather difficult even with Chaldea's equipment.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
I give up, too. I'm not a real mage in the first place.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Urh...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fran's been making noise...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Somebody here has something to say.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Fran? You're hiding over there...Is something wrong?   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uhh......Uhh, urrrh...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, she fled from the literary Heroic Spirits next door? I know how she feels. They are annoying.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uhh......Uhh, urrrh...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Don't hide, show your face here. Come on now.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uhh, uhhh...  
   
**Mordred:**   
What, you have something to say to us? Then spit it out.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uhh...  
   
**Mash:**   
I don't mind. As long as you're fine with us,right, Senpai?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You can tell us anything.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uhh, urrrh...Ahh...  
   
**Fran:**   
...Ahh...  
   
**Fran:**   
...Ahh, uhh...Urhhh, uhh...  
   
**Fran:**   
...Ahh, ahh, ahhh...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Wha...Is that true!?   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm shocked. Fran, I had no idea you could do that...  
   
**Jekyll:**   
???  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Tell me, do you really understand? Do you really understand what she's saying?   
   
**Mash:**   
Somewhat. She also uses gestures,so it's like reading a kind of sign language...  
   
**Mordred:**   
It seems she knows where the Helter Skelter's remote control is.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh!?   
   
**Jekyll:**   
R-Really?   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uhh...  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Let me double-check. Fran, can you...detect traces of the magical energy that controls them?   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uhh. Uhh.   
   
**Mordred:**   
There, you see? She nodded. All right, this makes things easier. Let's get moving!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
...You know, even though I've gotten used to it,this poor visibility is irritating.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uhh.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Say, Fujimaru. Your court mage...Dr. Maron, was it?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Can't he make us a far-seeing crystal or something? That would have been a snap for Merlin...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Roman! My name is Roman! And don't compare me to Merlin!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He was the ultimate hermit wizard! I'm just a modern-day doctor!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Margarine?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Marmalade?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh!? You're a mage and you're saying you don't know!? Merlin! I'm talking about Merlin!   
   
**Mordred:**   
King Arthur's successor and mastermind of the Round Table. He was a great mage born half-human, half-incubus.   
   
**Mordred:**   
He isn't famous anymore? Haha! That feels great! Serves him right!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Merlin was one of the world's most renowned kingmakers. He was also behind Arthur pulling the sword from the stone.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Apparently, he had extraordinary magecraft skills, but was ultimately imprisoned at world's end for woman trouble.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah. I heard he's all crabby and in a tower at a corner of Avalon, unable to leave or die.   
   
**Mordred:**   
How can I put it? He was a flighty bastard. Imagine a perpetual flurry of flowers behind him...do you get me?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I do.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Well, whatever. Enough about him. He's so spineless he can't even rush over to London's calamity.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...More importantly. Tell me, Fujimaru, are you okay with that?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay with what?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's wrong?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
(Mash, I'm talking about Mash. You see how depressed she looks? Go talk to her. )  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong, Mash?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You seem down, Mash.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Physically, there's nothing wrong with me, but......mentally, I have a problem.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm sorry, Senpai. Our battles are getting more intense,but I haven't been improving at all...  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?   
   
**Mash:**   
...It's my Noble Phantasm. Servants' true fighting powers lie in Noble Phantasms.   
   
**Mash:**   
I've seen many Noble Phantasms up till now. All of them have been miracles worthy of their heroic names.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yet, I still&mdash;can't use my Noble Phantasm properly.   
   
**Mash:**   
...At this rate, I'm just a burden. I know that,but I still can't remember his True Name...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Even without a Noble Phantasm...  
   
**Mash:**   
No, I need a Noble Phantasm!   
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, um...I'm sorry I yelled at you. But it will definitely become necessary...that's my hunch.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's not your fault, Mash.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Indeed, the merge was due to a sudden accident. But he entrusted me with everything...  
   
**Mash:**   
The point is, I'm not oblivious of the Noble Phantasm's true value. I don't even know his True Name...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
So that's what this is about. You heard Helter Skelter is a Noble Phantasm and became depressed.   
   
**Mordred:**   
True, a Servant who cannot use a Noble Phantasm is no Servant at all.   
   
**Mordred:**   
No matter how weak the Noble Phantasm, its very existence is proof of that hero. It's a matter of pride.   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Mordred:**   
But you're different, Mash. You're you. How you think and your honor are different from that Shield bastard.   
   
**Mordred:**   
It's true you haven't mastered using that Noble Phantasm. From what I've seen, you're about a third of the way there.   
   
**Mordred:**   
The remaining two-thirds are untapped. Or maybe you,being you, won't get to 100% and that's that.   
   
**Mash:**   
...So it is like that.   
   
**Mash:**   
The "Demi" side...The human part of me is dragging Senpai down...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Fool. That's ridiculous. Listen until I'm done talking.   
   
**Mordred:**   
You're not fully utilizing your Noble Phantasm. But I'm sure&mdash;you're stronger than the original Heroic Spirit.   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? The original Heroic Spirit...You mean the Heroic Spirit that I merged with?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Yes. You're much, much stronger than him. That's coming from me, so there's no doubt about it.   
   
**Mordred:**   
You may come up short not having a Noble Phantasm,but not anywhere else. Am I right, Fujimaru?   
   
**Mordred:**   
For you,Mash is the perfect partner, isn't she?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll do something about that Noble Phantasm!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I-Is that really the case?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Okay. If that's the case, I feel much better.   
   
**Mordred:**   
There, you see? In the first place, it's a Master's job to take care of their Servant.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Whether you can utilize the true value of a Noble Phantasm is Fujimaru's problem, not yours, Mash.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Right, Fujimaru?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Before Mash can become a full-fledged Servant,you need to become a first-rate Master.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll be first-rate together.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll teach you how to use it eventually.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fouuu!   
   
**Mordred:**   
There you go. So don't worry about it, Mash.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Fujimaru is the one who's sitting in the hot seat.   
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Right!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...All right, can we get moving soon? I'm sorry, as everyone is in a good mood, but...  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Hmmph. Fujimaru, summon a Rider Servant and have it give Maron a swift kick with its hind legs.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, yeah, it's all my fault. My fault! Now, time for combat. Multiple hostile readings approaching!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Go rout them to liven things up!   
   
## Section 10: At the End of Brilliant Steam   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uhh...  
   
**Mash:**   
That direction. Got it.... Senpai, it seems we want to go west from here.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
West is...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe the Westminster area?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yes, probably the Westminster area. That's where we'll find the Houses of Parliament.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Let's go there and pound them down. Ah. But first.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes?   
   
**Mordred:**   
There's one thing I need to say. This time, my hands are tied protecting Fran.   
   
**Mordred:**   
You see, she's not a Servant, and it's unknown how much damage an artificial human can take.   
   
**Mordred:**   
So "I'm going to protect her. "...We have a strange connection.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We can't count on Mordred during the battle then,so you guys will have to provide all the muscle. Be careful!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Roger.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No problem.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right. Okay then, Senpai. Let's move out!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...To think it's really near the Houses of Parliament. What a place for a remote control. Is it actually inside?   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uhh, uhrrr!   
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like it's close. She says it's in our immediate vicinity&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
Look, there's a gargantuan one! Fran, get behind me and stay there!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Mash, Fujimaru! I'm leaving this one to you. Take it apart!   
   
**Mash:**   
Roger that. Master, it's combat with a giant hostile. Awaiting orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;All giant hostile targets have gone silent.   
   
**Mash:**   
It appears it wasn't a Servant...But, was this the Noble Phantasm that's manipulating the others?   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh.... Uh, uhh.   
   
**Mordred:**   
It seems so. Okay, that's one nuisance out of the way.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Good work. Fran. We pulled through thanks to you.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh, uh. Ah...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash, Fujimaru. Just in case,could you send me some visual data of the remains?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'll go ahead and analyze them here. Well, I'm just going to ask Da Vinci about them.   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Doctor. We discovered something strange. Something that the other Helter Skelters did not possess.   
   
**Mash:**   
Perhaps the manufacturer's name? It's written in English.   
   
**Mash:**   
"Charles Babbage, AD 1888"  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh!!?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Hmm. What's wrong, Fran?   
   
**Fran:**   
......  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning, Senpai. Did you sleep well?   
   
**Mash:**   
It seems like you went by yourself to the nap room a little earlier...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I couldn't sleep much.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Those author Heroic Spirits were there...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh...um, that's right...The two Heroic Spirit authors are occupying that room...  
   
**Mash:**   
In that case, you probably didn't get much rest. I-I'm sorry I didn't notice.   
   
**Mash:**   
I...wish I had let you use the sofa in the living room that was assigned to me...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's okay.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm glad it worked out this way.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Mm. Both of you are awake. Hey, have you seen Fran around?   
   
**Mash:**   
Come to think of it...Oh! Senpai, maybe Fran...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
In the next room.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
In the authors' room.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Well, if she's fine with that, it's fine. I myself have no intention of entering that room.   
   
**Mash:**   
That room gives off a kind of odd ambience. I wonder if that's the power of authors with looming deadlines.   
   
**Mordred:**   
They've basically just been writing since materializing. Though I'm not sure if Andersen is really working or not.   
   
**Mash:**   
I couldn't help but sense a strange pressure coming from that room...  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Good morning, everyone. Looks like you all got some rest.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
There's something we need to talk about, okay? It's the name you found a few hours earlier.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Charles Babbage, right? He was an outstanding British scientist and mathematician of the 19th century.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Yes. He belongs to this age. I haven't met him myself, but I recall a few things.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
I'm sure that he and the original Dr. Victor Frankenstein were acquaintances.   
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;I'm sorry, but please wait.   
   
**Mash:**   
Babbage was supposed to have passed away at least a decade prior to our present time.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Huh? No, that's strange. He may be old, but he should still be an active scholar in good health.   
   
**Mash:**   
???  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Jekyll, are you sure that's not a lapse in your memory? Are you really sure that Babbage is a man of this era?   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Of course. I came across his name while perusing this year's Royal Society Almanac. Victor also spoke of him.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
So I can't imagine he's dead. His inventions were featured in newspapers from last year and this year, too.   
   
**Mash:**   
Allow me to confirm this. Let's see, yes, a newspaper will do.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Indeed, there is an article here. Charles Babbage. Born 1791. This is the very man in question.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I can think of two possibilities. One is that our historical records do not match reality.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Another is that a "shift" of events has occurred. That, in fact, has occurred in all the previous eras.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Orleans, Rome, even Okeanos. The events were all slightly distorted and "shifted. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Due to events changing, the dead are still alive and not there as Heroic Spirits&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's possible. The same applies to those who died from the Demonic Fog.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It may be that 20th century events have shifted all the way into this era.   
   
**Mash:**   
So...in the case of Fran, as well as Mr. Jekyll?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We can't rule it out. So who belongs to this era, and who doesn't?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's extremely difficult to determine. Especially when there are no records left in existence&mdash;  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Hmm. Are you talking about me? I'm curious, but we'll talk about it later. I've received some emergency correspondence.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
It's bad news from my information network. Saber, this concerns you too.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
All the Helter Skelters that had been completely shut down&mdash;have reactivated.   
   
**Mordred:**   
What, again? So there was another remote control elsewhere?   
   
**Mash:**   
...This is indeed an emergency. We need to deactivate them again as quickly as possible.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. There's no way we can let the enemy procure any other Servants that materialize from the fog.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash, Fujimaru, I'm counting on you. Make sure you stop the Helter Skelters for good this time!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Got it!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes!   
   
**Mordred:**   
But, having said that,we've got Fran on our side. We can dodge the enemy.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Do the same thing as last time. Head straight to the remote without encountering enemies.   
   
**Fran:**   
......  
   
**Mash:**   
You're right. Let's hurry, but be careful no to let our guard down.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I won't. Then again, thinking of Fran's precision last time&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, we're running into them already? We haven't reached the remote-controlled ones yet, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Machine sounds ahead. Several large-type units! It's an enemy group. Master, your orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...Enemy group defeated. It seems like we're being attacked more frequently.   
   
**Mordred:**   
The enemy just keeps on coming...Fran, what's wrong? Are you not feeling so good?   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh...  
   
**Mordred:**   
So next we head east...Seems like you're pointing in more directions than before.   
   
**Mordred:**   
If something's wrong, it's okay to say so. Like I said, just be frank with us.   
   
**Fran:**   
...  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...We defeated the enemy group. We believe the attack frequency has been rising.   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, is this&mdash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's probably Fran.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, I suppose so.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Maybe the properties of the magical circuits changed?   
   
**Mash:**   
I don't know. But, if you allow me to state...my personal theory...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I do believe that...Fran is the cause. She's hesitating when it comes to directional commands.   
   
**Mash:**   
Isn't that right...Fran?   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh...  
   
**Mordred:**   
......  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Fran. We need to talk.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh.   
   
**Mordred:**   
You have no intention of leading us to the remote, do you? It's obvious at this point.   
   
**Mash:**   
Is that true? Fran&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah. She's hesitating about something. One more thing.   
   
**Mordred:**   
There's something she hasn't told us. Right, Fran?   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh.... Uhh, uh, uh.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...Look, I've said this so many times now. You haven't forgotten, right?   
   
**Mordred:**   
If you have something on your mind or something to say, be frank with us.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, it's okay to talk to us.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We want you to tell us.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh...  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh, uh...uhh...  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uhh...ah...ah...ah, ah...uhh...  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uhh...  
   
**Mordred:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh. Right. That's what it was.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is she saying?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't understand...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
She knows a man named Babbage. She has apparently even talked to him in person.   
   
**Mash:**   
She can trace the magical energy because she's tracing something resembling his presence.   
   
**Mash:**   
But, he is not the type to do these kinds of things. That's what she's saying.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
Mr. Jekyll said just as much. I also should have noticed at that point...  
   
**Mordred:**   
...I get it. You're covering for him. Isn't that right, Fran?   
   
**Mordred:**   
But, your own actions are contradictory. Babbage isn't the type to do "these kinds of things," right?   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Well then, it's simple.... I hate to quote that stupid brat, but I have no choice.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Fran. Calm down. Try using your imagination. You can do that much, right?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Babbage isn't the type to act like this. Yet, Helter Skelters are wandering around everywhere.   
   
**Mordred:**   
So, that means he's being forced into this. To do "these kinds of things. "  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Okay, good girl. So, you understand what you need to do, right?   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh, uh!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That settles it.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's find the remote this time.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai!   
   
**Mordred:**   
&mdash;It's close.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I can tell, too. The magical energy is concentrated here, even in the Demonic Fog.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Look, over there. I'm sure Fujimaru will also hear it soon.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I detected it here as well! It's a giant response,and almost right in front of you. To think it was there!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh, it was in the center of the City Area. It was right near the apartment.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Well then, it's time for us to meet. Either it's the other remote, or&mdash;  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh, uh!   
   
**Babbage:**   
&mdash;Listen, listen, listen! I am the King of Steam.   
   
**Babbage:**   
Unable to grasp the future that lay within reach,I am the king of an evanescent world of fantasy.   
   
**Babbage:**   
I am known to you rabble as the mage "B". I am a mastermind behind "Project Demonic Fog" that's enveloping this city.   
   
**Babbage:**   
Furthermore&mdash;I am a Heroic Spirit emerged from the Demonic Fog of the empire's capital.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Mage "B? "  
   
**Mordred:**   
...One of the enemy bosses, huh. Damn, I didn't see that coming.   
   
**Mordred:**   
True, your name starts with "B. " I see. I was overthinking and missed something so simple.   
   
**Mash:**   
However, this...Is the same shape as a Helter Skelter?   
   
**Mordred:**   
This guy's specs are probably way higher. Just a hunch, but my hunches are usually right.   
   
**Mash:**   
He does not seem human. So he must be...a Servant!   
   
**Babbage:**   
I am the King of Steam. Having died once, I now dwell within a world of fantasy.   
   
**Babbage:**   
My fantasies have sublimated to a Reality Marble,but it's not enough. It's not enough. It's still not enough.   
   
**Babbage:**   
Behold how I desire. Behold how I struggle.   
   
**Babbage:**   
With steel, I seek to lead a steam-filled civilization. With ideas, I seek to lead an inconceivable civilization.   
   
**Babbage:**   
And&mdash;I lament the incineration of humanity and civilization, of the world and the future.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, so that's it! It means that he himself is already a Reality Marble!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's similar to the Magical Tome. Though, the Magical Tome distributed sleep to materialize.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He will continue to disperse his alter egos infinitely. Most likely, that's&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
Mr. Babbage. If what you say is the truth,we can reason with each other.   
   
**Mash:**   
We are the same. The future should not be burned to ashes!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Enough gabbing. Listen up, you big piece of scrap iron.   
   
**Mordred:**   
The daughter of someone you know has come to stop you.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Listen to what she has to say. Your pompous speeches and everything can come after that.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh, uh!   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh...uhh, ah...ah, ah!   
   
**Fran:**   
...Ah, ah, ah!   
   
**Babbage:**   
&mdash;Oh, I see. I could never forget Victor's daughter. &mdash;Are you there?   
   
**Babbage:**   
Lovely little artificial human. Piteous being unloved by your creator, thus craving love.   
   
**Babbage:**   
Ah, I can hear your words. Ah, I can hear your thoughts.   
   
**Babbage:**   
That's right&mdash;I...no, we, must fulfill our aspirations as scholars.   
   
**Babbage:**   
We exist for the sake of humanity and civilization. Thus, I sought...a fantasy world, a new era of dreams.   
   
**Babbage:**   
Thus...  
   
**Babbage:**   
Gah!?   
   
**Babbage:**   
...Ugh...uh...ughh, ugh...ugh!? What...is this...Angrboda's interference!?   
   
**Babbage:**   
The Holy Grail that was implanted! I see, so "M"...so even I!   
   
**Babbage:**   
Victor's daughter! Run...for your life!   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh!   
   
**Mordred:**   
&mdash;Enough, Fran.   
   
**Mordred:**   
You said what needed to be said,and he replied in his own way. You did a good job.   
   
**Mordred:**   
But, sometimes it ends up like this. Your feelings don't get conveyed, and you must settle things with swords...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Sometimes it just turns out this way.   
   
**Babbage:**   
Arghh!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Here he comes!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Communication breakdown, and now a battle!? This is a similar reaction when a Command Spell has been used&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If this is the Holy Grail's doing, then we have no choice but to defeat him. Mash, Fujimaru!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, your orders. Commencing battle with a large-type Servant!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We have no choice!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's stop him!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Yes, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Babbage:**   
...Head to the underground part of the city.   
   
**Babbage:**   
...Deep, deep, deep beneath the Underground, in the depths...There...lies the core of..."Project Demonic Fog"...  
   
**Babbage:**   
The source of the Fog...covering the city...Namely, my invention...Massive Steam Engine Angrboda...  
   
**Babbage:**   
The Holy Grail...was used as the power source for...Angrboda...  
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh...uhh...ah.   
   
**Babbage:**   
...Sorry, daughter of Victor.   
   
**Babbage:**   
I heard your voice...but I am no longer a human...with a proper life...  
   
**Babbage:**   
...but an improbable Servant...of irrelevant thoughts...  
   
**Mordred:**   
...  
   
**Babbage:**   
...I...  
   
**Babbage:**   
...Oh, I have seen a dream of my world......But...Even that...  
   
**Babbage:**   
...Even in a world where my dream will not be realized...I do not wish to end your world...  
   
**Mordred:**   
&mdash;Looks like we have the next destination.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, underground. That's what Mr. Babbage told us.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Let's get Fran back to Jekyll's apartment first. Then we'll take out the final boss.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's do that.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're surely getting that Holy Grail.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, Senpai.   
   
## Section 11: Angrboda   
   
**Mordred:**   
...Under Londinium, huh?   
   
**Mordred:**   
I knew there was a subway underground, but who'd have thought there'd be something "under" that.   
   
**Mordred:**   
And how dense this Demonic Fog is...Isn't it getting thicker the lower we go?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm not sure. I can't observe from here,but if it's getting dense enough to visually confirm...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Then maybe what Babbage said was true. After all, there really was a path leading below.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why is this here in London?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Was this made by the Mage's Association?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
London has had an underground transportation network since the middle of the 19th century.   
   
**Mash:**   
But there are no records of underground passages like this.... Perhaps the remnant of a national top secret project?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Mage's Association only excavated the area right under the British Museum...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hard to think an individual secretly built an underground labyrinth, so maybe this existed before London took shape?   
   
**Mordred:**   
There's this old story. Deep underneath the Tower of London&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
The head of an ancient king of Britain named Bran is buried, and it watches over Londinium.   
   
**Mash:**   
A head, huh...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Interesting story, huh? The Tower of London has other stories, like the crows.   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, I know a bit about that one. They watch over London&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
They're said to be the avatar of my father, King Arthur. I mean they're crows! His avatars are crows! Ha ha!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What? I think crows are really cool. Raven Master is really cool, right Mash?   
   
**Mash:**   
Uhh...What do you think, Senpai?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What? You're going to ask me?   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Pretty cool.   
   
**Mash:**   
Right. I think so too, Senpai.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Not really cool.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's...true. No, I, well...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Setting crows aside, you can't track this underground passageway or routes from your end?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry, just as Mash mentioned earlier,there are no records. You'll have to explore on your own.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hopefully it's not too complicated...But it already sounds like a labyrinth.   
   
**Mash:**   
Deep underneath London...An unknown underground passage, underground labyrinth.   
   
**Mash:**   
If what Mr. Babbage said was correct,then a "large-scaled machine" should exist.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The Massive Steam Engine?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The source of Demonic Fog?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, the source of the Demonic Fog filling London. The Massive Steam Engine Angrboda, powered by a Holy Grail.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's what he mentioned right before vanishing. To think a Holy Grail would be integrated into a machine...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But, that makes some sense. The existence of a fog abnormally full of magical energy, and its proliferation.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A strange situation that throws off a Servant's detection ability, and prevents various observations from Chaldea.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see, by using the power of the Holy Grail,something like that would be possible.   
   
**Mash:**   
That may also explain the mechanism that materializes Servants from the Demonic Fog.   
   
**Mash:**   
By incorporating the Holy Grail into a device,the Demonic Fog gained the ability to summon Heroic Spirits.   
   
**Mash:**   
Such speculation is also possible.   
   
**Mordred:**   
But Angrboda, huh? That's a grand old name.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Angrboda?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The one from Norse mythology.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Right, Angrboda is a Divinity from Norse mythology. They brought forth Fenrir, World Serpent, and the Goddess of Death among others.   
   
**Mordred:**   
With Loki, right? An unbelievable woman giant, but I don't hate her.   
   
**Mordred:**   
It's not often that you see someone give birth to so many troublesome beings&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
Definitely worth punching. I'm sure she has thick skin too, so I can get down and hack her into pieces, right?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Oh, that's what you meant by "don't hate her"...)  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(It's been so hard to retort to all this...I'm sure Mordred is saying everything on purpose)  
   
**Mash:**   
(Y-Yes. I believe Mordred's mother was...)  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Yeah. A witch among witches. None other than Morgan! )  
   
**Mordred:**   
&mdash;Looks like they're finally here. Hostiles.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Beat me to it again. Detecting multiple targets! Looks like there aren't any more Helter Skelters.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Quality aside, they're coming in large quantities! Be careful!   
   
**Mash:**   
Roger that. Master, starting combat!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
...We've come pretty far down. This is the second level, isn't it?   
   
**Mash:**   
We've travelled pretty far. We're most likely under Hyde Park now.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh brother. We've walked quite a bit...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm mapping the whole thing here. You shouldn't be traveling in circles, at least.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Taking into account Fujimaru's stamina,you should probably take appropriate periods of rest.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Doesn't look like we'll get that chance. They're here again.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We've got enemy signatures. Quite a few! It will be another series of battles. Be careful!   
   
**Mash:**   
Roger that. Master, give me you orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
...What level are we on now?   
   
**Mash:**   
The fourth level. We went down a set of stairs earlier.   
   
**Mash:**   
We're currently several hundred meters underground.   
   
**Mordred:**   
We've gone pretty deep. Isn't it going to be a pain to go back up?   
   
**Mordred:**   
...More hostiles again. It really is quantity over quality.   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, give me your orders. Going to demolish the enemy group!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
What the hell is this?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Almost identical to the Fuyuki Greater Grail. Incredible magical energy.   
   
**Mash:**   
So much magical energy, I can feel it strongly even in the Demonic Fog. Such a giant Magical Reactor Core...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I can observe it here, too. This is amazing. No doubt about it, "that's" what's creating the Fog.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I've never seen a machine this big. Angrboda...The name of a giant fits perfectly.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I'd love to take a closer look&mdash;But it looks like the last boss is here.   
   
**D：???:**  
&mdash;Oddly enough.   
   
**D：???:**  
Oddly enough, it is just as Paracelsus said. Evil must be stopped by those who do good.   
   
**D：???:**  
The Massive Steam Engine, Angrboda. This is our evil embodied, but it is also our hope.   
   
**D：???:**  
Your path ends here. Good will now be destroyed by our evil.   
   
**Mordred:**   
You folks really like to talk. Shut up. What ends here is your life.   
   
**D：???:**  
Heroic Spirit Mordred. The 13th Knight of the Round Table and legendary Treacherous King.   
   
**D：???:**  
I thought you'd stand with us,but it seems you're now a hero of good. Ironic.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who are you?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you "M"?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**D：???:**  
I am Makiri Zolgen. The first leader of this "Project Demonic Fog. "  
   
**Makiri:**   
One mage seeking the annihilation of this era&mdash;the Fourth Singularity, by releasing Demonic Fog all over England.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All of England!? So it's not just London! That's...I have to say, going to be tough...  
   
**Makiri:**   
Destroying London alone isn't enough. Only by destroying this era completely can I erase the Foundation of Humanity.   
   
**Makiri:**   
That is our King's wish, and an act which we had no choice but to embrace after our surrender.   
   
**Mash:**   
Our King...Master, is he part of the same group as Lev Lainur?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So you're with Lev!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who is "Our King"!?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Makiri:**   
There's no need to say another word. Angrboda is shifting to overload mode.   
   
**Makiri:**   
A powerful Heroic Spirit, one sufficient to truly awaken the Demonic Fog that fills the city, will now materialize.   
   
**Makiri:**   
A single strike from him shall activate the Demonic Fog,engulfing the world. "Everything" will meet its end.   
   
**Makiri:**   
Now, behold. The Heroic Spirit we desire shall appear from the Demonic Fog shortly.   
   
**Makiri:**   
A Pioneer of the Star, fitting for the end of the Myth of Humanity. Or perhaps, this planet's glimmer&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
I ain't letting that happen. I'll kill you, and destroy Angrboda.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I'll never forgive someone other than myself for trampling over Britain. Even if you are a human.   
   
**Mash:**   
!?!?!? He's not...a Servant!?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Just a hunch. I told you they're usually right, remember? He's human.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I don't know if he's rightfully from this era, or "shifted"like Babbage was.   
   
**Mash:**   
Why are you doing this, Makiri Zolgen? Why are you destroying the era you live in&mdash;  
   
**Makiri:**   
Of course, I tried to resist. But I realized everything was useless.   
   
**Makiri:**   
Even if I wished for the salvation of all humanity,the world where they should live has already been incinerated.   
   
**Makiri:**   
Past, present, and future. Our King has decided not to allow them to exist.   
   
**Makiri:**   
&mdash;All will be destroyed before it is achieved.   
   
**Makiri:**   
The King has proclaimed to us that he tires of seeing more of this ugliness and existence.   
   
**Makiri:**   
Then, before long...  
   
**Makiri:**   
No, there's nothing left to say. With the power of our King I shall destroy you.   
   
**Makiri:**   
You will die here, without seeing the last Heroic Spirit. Come forth from the sky of destruction, our Demon God!   
   
**Mordred:**   
What!? This presence, this mass magical energy!   
   
**Mash:**   
He's summoning a Demon God! Just like the last two!   
   
**Makiri:**   
One of the 72 Demon Gods. Demon God Barbatos&mdash;This is the form of our evil.   
   
**Makiri:**   
My King has "found" my evilness. The ugliness lurking within me as I desire human salvation.   
   
**Makiri:**   
With the epitome of my abomination&mdash;Begone, you who seek to spread good as I once did!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Demon God Barbatos has gone completely silent. We've won.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good work.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't let your guard down.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai.   
   
**Mordred:**   
That was a weird monster. That was hard even for me to fight.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Now all that's left is to smash this big thing. Let's do it, Mash, Fujimaru.   
   
**Makiri:**   
...It's too late. There's enough Demonic Fog...filling London...already...  
   
**Mordred:**   
You're still alive? You're tough.   
   
**Makiri:**   
Now...Come, my last Heroic Spirit...  
   
**Makiri:**   
Pioneer of the Stars...who can complete my evil!   
   
**Makiri:**   
...Thou who are trapped in a cage of madness...and I the summoner who holds thy chains&mdash;  
   
**Makiri:**   
Seventh Heaven clad in the great words of power! Come forth from the circle of binding, guardian of scales!   
   
**Mash:**   
This is...A Heroic Servant summoning incantation!?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Shut your mouth!   
   
**Mordred:**   
...Shut up and die.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, his last words were a Heroic Servant summoning incantation. With...the phrase causing Madness Enhancement.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Unfortunately, you're right. Mash, Fujimaru, incoming Servant!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He didn't use the full spell, but the Demonic Fog served as the circle and the rest of the incantation.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I can see the Servant response clearly from here. Mash should feel it too. This is...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A Great Hero-class magical energy response. No&mdash;  
   
**Makiri:**   
See? I sacrificed my life for this summoning, and it succeeded...  
   
**Mordred:**   
You're still alive!? You're human, right? How can you be so tough&mdash;  
   
**Makiri:**   
Magical energy of the Holy Grail, amplified by Angrboda...The power of the Demonic fog...all concentrated onto "him"...  
   
**Makiri:**   
...He has reached the realm of the gods!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The magical energy response is huge! It's coming!   
   
## Section 12: Myth of Thunder and Lightning   
   
**H：???:**  
&mdash;You called me, did you not?   
   
**H：???:**  
What was it that called me, lightning itself? What was it that called me, the genius?   
   
**H：???:**  
A cry? A wish? Good? Evil?   
   
**H：???:**  
I see&mdash;It was all of them that brought me here.   
   
**H：???:**  
I, the lightning,the genius, Nikola Tesla!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Fascinating. All the scholars together called me?   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I, the one who brought a new myth to humanity! I, the one who surpasses Indra, and even Zeus!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Hahaha&mdash;  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Hahahahahahahaha! Fascinating! You have brought me laughter, scholars!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I am a genius, but also a super-human who loved the bizarre! Very well then!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I shall grant your wish! I, the genius and the lightning, shall head to the surface!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Hahaha! Haha&mdash;Hahahahahahahahaha!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&ndash;So, yeah.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
While the explosive magical energy from the summoning was blowing you away or almost burying you under rubble,  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Heroic Spirit Nikola Tesla started heading for the surface. This was just a few minutes ago.   
   
**Mash:**   
Nikola Tesla. He's known for being a scientist and inventor, isn't he?   
   
**Mash:**   
If you define the modern era as an electricity-based machine civilization, then you can say he created its "foundation. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Just like he said,you could call him a Pioneer of the Stars.   
   
**Mash:**   
He was supposed to be alive in this era,but he's been summoned as a Servant?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yup. Looks like there's similar cases in the past. Where one of them is a human, the other's a Heroic Spirit.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But the human Nikola Tesla has nothing to do with that. We just have to stop his materialization as a Heroic Spirit.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The powerful lightning that he automatically brings to his surroundings will instantly activate the Demonic Fog.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If he gets to a place where the fog is especially dense,what's happening in London will spread explosively.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Then it won't just be in London. It'll cover all of Britain.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If that happens,we'll be unable to restore Humanity in this Singularity.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Foundation of Humanity will be completely destroyed, and human history will end in this era.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's...just what Makiri Zolgen said would happen, isn't it?   
   
**Mordred:**   
We just need to give that lightning guy a good beatdown,right? Nice and simple.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Normally a Heroic Spirit that appears from the fog doesn't automatically become our enemy, but...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In his case, Makiri's incantation has had a small effect similar to Madness Enhancement.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He's not a pure Berserker. But his mind and actions are limited.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
When I spoke to him via the comms,he did respond&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But there was a sense that his actions were controlled. If we don't stop him he'll automatically go for the Fog.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's stop him!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's chase him.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai. By the way...are you hurt?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru's vitals are fine, thanks to Mash promptly giving cover. More importantly...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah. Enemies. Weak ones. Their Master is gone. How faithful of them!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, your orders. We'll destroy the enemy!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
Incoming, it's another homunculus! It's needlessly huge!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Maybe it absorbed too much fog and grew? No, that's not it. Maybe an effect of the Holy Grail?   
   
**Mash:**   
Forget that! We have to fight it! Master, your orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
More! Dammit, we can't get anywhere like this!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Let's try and break through somehow.   
   
**Mash:**   
He's supposedly walking,so he can't have gone that far!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If he was going full speed as a Servant, the Demonic Fog would have expanded by now and the world would be doomed.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Does that mean...He's trying to help us? Maybe?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Enough talking! Let's do this!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
...We're through! Hurry!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The response is coming from right over there! I mean literally! He's right there!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even if his actions are controlled, can we assume he's on our side, mentally? ...No, we don't know that.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You should assume it'll be a fight. He'll attack anyone who tries to stop him!   
   
**Mash:**   
Roger. &mdash;Master, I see him up ahead. It's Nikola Tesla!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
You're here! Heroes of hope, reaching out to the future.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Unfortunately, I must fight you! That's how my current existence has been created.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
And what's more&mdash;  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I have power in this manifestation. So I want to try something I've been thinking about.   
   
**Mordred:**   
What? The Demonic Fog is tinged with lightning?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is...not good...The Demonic Fog has enough electricity in it to easily kill a human.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
This is what it means to activate the fog. It absorbs even a Servant's magical energy without limit!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Of course, I'm an exception! The Activated Fog absorbs your magical energy upon approach!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
It's possible it will even absorb your Spirit Cores. Now, will you still approach me?   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
If you want to defeat me, first you must completely remove this Activated Fog&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
We can't get close&mdash;? Doctor, there's nothing we can do like this.   
   
**Mordred:**   
We just need to blow away the fog, right? It's simple.   
   
**Mordred:**   
If it absorbs magical energy, it'll work out somehow,even if I blast it at full power. Here I go!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Clarent&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
&mdash;Blood Arthur!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Releasing the Noble Phantasm's True Name! Good,a majority of energy was absorbed but the fog dispersed!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's not totally gone, so it'll come back soon,but you've brief window where you can fight him!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
That power, that sword&mdash;It is without a doubt Clarent!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Hahaha! Then that girl is Mordred,an old Heroic Spirit of the Earth.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Perfect! While I'm at it,I'll destroy every Heroic Spirit of Heaven and of Earth!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Old myths are unnecessary! Only "Humans and the Star"Heroic Spirits should exist beyond the age of electricity!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Come then! Remnants of fantasy, ancient myths fading so fleetingly!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Let's go, Mash, Fujimaru!   
   
**Mash:**   
Roger! Master, prepare for anti-Servant combat!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;The fog's coming back! We'll have to temporarily retreat, Master!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Dammit! The fog's in the way and my magical energy can't reach him! I can't hit him!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Hmph. You were doing well, but you're out of time! Hahahaha! Poor ancient Heroic Spirits!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Enough fun for now, then! This genius heads once more for London's skies.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
...Oh, yes. While my temperament is a little different than usual...  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I am supposed to be a Heroic Spirit that loves humanity. Thus, I will tell you this, human.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
After reaching the surface, I'll head to the densest part of the Demonic Fog, likely the skies above Buckingham Palace.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
A single strike of my lightning there will truly activate the Demonic Fog, and swallow everything&ndash;  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Everything. Yes, literally all of creation!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
It'll destroy the cancer of civilization, strip the land of its ostentation, and burn away this island with inviolate lightning!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
With this Singularity as the origin,the rest of humanity is destined to be incinerated!   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
However! However&mdash;  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
If you are still not giving up,follow me. Try and stop me, heroes!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
You are about to face me, the new God of Thunder, who created an era and a civilization with new mythology.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
So strike me down,with the manifestation of an even newer myth!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
There is no other way! Haha&mdash;hahahaha! Hahahahhahaha!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Wait! Nikola Tesla!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
...London, huh? It's been so long.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I had aspired to be a British gentleman,and now I'm forced to play the role of world destroyer.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I never would've thought it would happen. However&mdash;  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Haha! I, the myth, the pioneer of a new age, am destroying electric civilization and human history itself!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
It's ironic, and hilarious! Haha! Hahahahaha!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Come! I proceed to the heavens! Grant me footing leading me to the fated spot in the sky where the Fog is densest!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
The Perkūnas's Ladder answer my call! I shall allow them to take me there!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Hahahahahaha! Hahaha! Is there no one left who can stop me?   
   
**D：???:**  
&mdash;Stop laughing and get your ass down here, then. It's easy, right?   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Oh&mdash;?   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Hmm. The lightning is crying. This is...  
   
**D：???:**  
"Golden" shines from a strike of lightning&mdash;  
   
**D：???:**  
Somebody's calling me. They tell me to destroy evil, and kill the demon.   
   
**D：???:**  
Shut up&mdash;  
   
**D：???:**  
Shut up, shut up! Stop whispering in my ear! I always swing my own axe, and that's that!   
   
**D：???:**  
I will beat down any and all evil! &mdash;The shining broad-axe, Golden!   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I don't want to give you my name, but I will. Sakata Kintoki, Heroic Spirit&mdash;here to save the day.   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
You in that ugly jacket. Those stairs are a traffic violation. Run along home and cry like a little girl.   
   
## Section 13: Beyond the Fog   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
This is a "doomed world" situation, isn't it?   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
My sense of smell is always accurate. If we don't stop you, the world's in trouble, right?   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Seems you want to head to the sky. If that happens, the world's all messed up from fog and lightning on top of fire.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Wonderful. Your understanding is as sharp as lightning,and just as quick!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Correct. The world ends if you don't stop me!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
But&mdash;Oh, I see. My oh my. Some things are truly interesting.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
A truly fascinating case. The lightning acted as catalyst for the Demonic Fog to summon a new Heroic Spirit.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Sakata Kintoki, you said? Seems you're another hero opposing the creation of a new legend.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
If you were a Heroic Spirit of Heaven or Earth from old myths, I'd have burned you up with a laugh, but you're...  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
"A Heroic Spirit of the Humans," huh?   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
You're one trying to hinder my path. You're someone willing to fight next to humans.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Isn't that right, Sakata Kintoki? No, I suppose I should call you Mr. Golden. I shall. No, I must.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Yes, you could be none other than Golden! Dazzling, just like plasma!   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
You don't look it, but you're quite fun, yourself. I'm glad you're so reasonable!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
A genius always understands what someone says and means. Even with a Madness Enhancement skill cast on him!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
But, ha, ha! I cannot hold back. Let me show you a piece of Nikola Tesla's genius!   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Now that's just golden! I'll show you the ace up my sleeve, as well&mdash;  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Hi there. Excuse me. Could you stop for a moment?   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
This is London, right? The city of fog, London, right?   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Where's the dreamy double-decker buses? Where's the British Museum, Clock Tower, St. Paul's Cathedral?   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
What's with this ominous fog? Why isn't there anyone here, even though it's midday?   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
And where are the fish and chips I was looking forward to? And that afternoon tea I was secretly yearning for?   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
What about the scones? Clotted cream? Fortnum & Mason's flagship store?   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
A majority of this area feels abandoned, no?   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Mikon? Is London facing swift annihilation or something?   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I tagged along to vacation in London so I could rehearse my honeymoon with my Master, and this is what I get?   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Now Kintoki, did you trick me? Are you making a fool out of a god?   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Ah...  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
This is&mdash;  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Unmistakably a Heroic Spirit of Earth. No, of Heaven? This genius can discern this presence. An old legend!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
But, ah...But...But&mdash;What a stunningly beautiful lady!   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Mikko?   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Even if already an inglorious resident of old legends, I,Nikola Tesla, will treat a lovely lady with utmost courtesy.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
A beautiful lady that represents the Orient. It's dangerous here. You should fall back, a bit.   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
What a nice, splendid spirit&mdash;No, I am devoted to my Master, so I cannot.   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
But your heart seems not so splendid. Did you get hit with a Madness Enhancement skill?   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
And you seem to be wise, as well. How wonderful. It's slightly different, but you're correct, My Lady.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
My words hold no meaning. I merely here to accomplish one act, contrary to my words!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Oh, how I do hate myself! Because I am a genius,my thoughts and my actions are disconnected&mdash;!   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I think that describes most men&mdash;Which is bad. What do you plan to do?   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
That depends on you! Lady, I do not mind if the two of you take me on!   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Then I'll do just that☆ Now, Kintoki. Let's get this over quickly so I can continue the trip!   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Oh, don't worry. I'll continue the trip by myself,so I won't be tying you down, Kintoki☆  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
That helps. But wait,you just took a free ride on my summons...  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
How about we talk about this later? Look over there. That hottie over there is already ready to fight, no?   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Um, Kintoki? You stopped talking all of a sudden and averted your gaze. What's wrong? (push)  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Your face&mdash;  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Huh?   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
It's way too close to mine&mdash;No, If you can, stick to support. I'll do the punching.   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
It'll be a great fight. We're both men of lightning. Let's make some sparks fly, Nikola Tesla!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hm? It looks like Nikola Tesla has stopped.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Suddenly, for some reason. He shouldn't have reached skies above Buckingham Palace yet.   
   
**Mordred:**   
That means we can still catch up. That's good. I might get a chance for another fight!   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, we should head to the surface now! Let's hurry, Master!   
   
**Mordred:**   
And now there's a big group coming this way! They should just run away now that they're free!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Multiple hostile signals! Fight your way through the battles!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
&mdash;I see why you're the son of the lightning god!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
You're doing great in the Activated Fog! A normal Servant would have had their Spirit Core eaten away!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I expect nothing less from a Heroic Spirit of Humans invited by my Lightning Fog, you stand for man's hope! But, haha, hahaha!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Your Spirit Core&mdash;There's already some cracks forming!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
You won't last much longer! At this rate,you will only be burned by my lightning, and shatter!   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Well if that isn't golden&mdash;You should calm down that fog a bit more!   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Can you stop ordering me around!? Only my Master can speak that way to me!   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Besides, I've been providing support this entire time. Spells just don't work well on that fog.   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Your face is so close! ...Come on! Fox, I'm counting on you, so let's do this!   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
You're our last chance! God of Arms, I seek aid facing enemies!   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Hmm, am I being worshipped? Is this worship?   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Mm, truly beautiful...That smile is like a sparkle from the sun, burning my heart!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Foxy Lady! You may be able to stand alongside my legend!   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Mikko? There's someone worshipping me here, too?   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
I'm really popular around here&mdash;W-Wait, no. My Master has to be the one.   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
A-Anyway, keep up your support! It's almost time.   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I'm gonna ruin that nice suit of his. Now&mdash;time to slam you with my super attack!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
&mdash;I'll blow you away! Special move:   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Golden Spark!   
   
**Mash:**   
...We're at the surface, Senpai!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Hmm? Somebody's here. A man and a woman. They're not dead, so are they Servants?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Looks like they're Servants that appeared from the fog. I see two of them. They don't look like enemies.   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Hey, are you guys the heroes he was talking about?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?   
   
**Mordred:**   
It doesn't matter if we're heroes or not. More importantly, it sounds like you fought him.   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Yeah...I can tell you this. We got rid of "all" that pain in the ass fog.   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Now it's up to you guys. I'll let you grab the glory...or whatever...Gonna rest. Whew...  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Well, with so much magical energy drained from you as you fought, utter exhaustion and near death are to be expected.   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
But you did wonderfully. You truly are one of Raikou's Four Kings, whose might shakes the heavens.   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
You too. Thanks for the help! Whew...  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
...But you just looked away, didn't you? You did. Why? Is your worship a lie?   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Eh, I did not. Sure you're not imagining it?   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
(Those boobs! I can see your boobs, Fox! I don't know where am I supposed to look, get it!? )  
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
???  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyway, this is a big help. We've got a chance now. Without the Activated Fog we can fight him head on!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Now we just have to catch up and slay him. Okay,let's follow him, Mash, Fujimaru!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are we going up those stairs?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, they're made with a type of magecraft...It seems, anyway. We can walk on them.   
   
**Mordred:**   
It's scary to think about them disappearing halfway up. But we'll deal with that if it happens.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Looks like there's no time to rest.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah, we're gonna run up those stairs! Even if they might disappear partway!   
   
**Mash:**   
That's probably a magical staircase created by Nikola Tesla. Who knows how long it will last...  
   
**Mordred:**   
I'll take care of that if it happens. There's no time to waste, just like you said.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right!   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
I'm counting on you guys! Don't screw this up!   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Huh? Is that all we get to do?   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
This feels like when you trip the metal detector at a security checkpoint!   
   
**Mordred:**   
&mdash;We caught up to him! This time, he's ours!   
   
**Mash:**   
I've sighted Heroic Spirit Nikola Tesla once more. He's walking towards the sky above Buckingham Palace!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We defeat him here!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The Activated Fog that was around him  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai. The Activated Fog is gone. That golden Servant was right!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
So you're here&mdash;So you truly will try to build a new legend?   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
But sadly, that's impossible. Even without Activated Fog, my lightning is far too strong.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Why? Because I am a genius. Why? Because I am the lightning.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
What is a god&mdash;Yes, what is a god? A god is the lightning.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Since ancient times, many men have believed this,and in fact...  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Even setting Zeus and Indra aside, it is indeed a god. Lightning, a divine power striking from the heavens.   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Behold. The light I bring to the earth is great power itself!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Energy guiding a new electric, consumer civilization! My lightning is the final farewell to the old era and its myths!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
It is a new myth! It is "my light," a gift unto humanity!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Now,I shall display to all of you!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
&ndash;System Keraunos!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Enemy Servant defeated!   
   
**Mordred:**   
My lightning won! Too bad, Nikola Tesla!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Haha...! Hahaha, Hahahahahaha!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
No, I don't think it's bad at all! I am a Pioneer of the Stars!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
I would never truly wish for humanity's end. The Heroic Spirits of Heaven and Earth are still a nuisance&mdash;  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
But continuation of the world means continuation of my lightning civilization! Thank you, you who desire new myths!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Heroes of hope! You have done well to defeat me, the modern Zeus!   
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
And so now it is time for me to return to the Throne&mdash;  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
Haha! Hahahahaha! Farewell, all of you&mdash;  
   
**Nikola Tesla:**   
&mdash;Farewell!   
   
**Mash:**   
...The enemy Servant has completely disappeared.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Sheesh, he said whatever and did whatever he pleased until the very end.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I've confirmed Nikola Tesla's annihilation. Good work. That should take care of things.   
   
**Mash:**   
What we're standing on was formed by his magical energy,so it should become unstable shortly.   
   
**Mash:**   
It's a very powerful effect, so it shouldn't disappear immediately...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
First we need to get safely back to the ground. This should take care of London's problems&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Oh. Right. Crap.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Hmm?   
   
**Mash:**   
What is it, Doctor?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think we forgot something.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...What about the Holy Grail?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. We forgot to get the Holy Grail from Angrboda. N-No, it's not our fault. We were in a hurry. Yeah!   
   
**Mordred:**   
You can take your time getting it. The only enemies left are wimps.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yeah, that's right. I don't know how I feel about going back underground.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Let's go get it now, then. There's no sense going back to Jekyll's apartment.   
   
**Mordred:**   
&mdash;Wait. Looks like something's showed up after all. What is it?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A high-density magical energy response? It's so big I can see it in the Demonic Fog...What the...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's different from Nikola Tesla's response,but the fog is gathering above Buckingham palace!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Something real bad is coming! Be careful, Mash, Fujimaru!   
   
**Mordred:**   
It doesn't matter what comes! I'll hack them all apart!   
   
**Mordred:**   
&mdash;Bring it!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Altria:**   
&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
!!!   
   
**Mash:**   
...That's......No, she is definitely...King Arthur!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
She's absorbing the remaining Demonic Fog as she manifests! This is bad! There's so much magical energy!   
   
**Mash:**   
It looks like she has a spear, not a sword...A swirling black lance...what twisted magical energy...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You feel the magical energy?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wasn't your detection weaker?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I can tell...Magical energy so big I can sense it even with Demonic Fog...  
   
**Mash:**   
It's similar to when Nikola Tesla manifested. But it's more clear&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
I can feel her animosity. It's a blind rage and hatred, like a Berserker!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Is she under the effect of Makiri Zolgen's incantation? Then even if we can talk to her, we'll still have to fight.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...We probably can't talk. That's King Arthur, ready to slay her foes.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Why...Why are you appearing now? If you're saving Londinium, you should have come sooner...  
   
**Mordred:**   
...No, maybe it's different.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Maybe you're here to kill me. Do you not like the idea of me saving Londinium?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Do you hate me that much? Is that why you've got the spear that killed me&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The spear that killed Mordred? Th-That's a Divine Construct, said to rival the holy sword!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Rhongomyniad, the holy spear! The legendary spear that's said to hold the two sides of the world together!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You already fought one battle with a powerful Servant. You need to retreat, Fujimaru!   
   
**Mordred:**   
No, not happening. King Arthur has decided we are enemies.   
   
**Mordred:**   
There's no getting away. We have to fight.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...No, you can run if you want. But there's a 90% chance you'll get blown away.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Besides, I'm not running.... I'm not turning my back on my father.   
   
**Mordred:**   
King Arthur is right in front of me! So there's only one thing for me to do!   
   
**Mordred:**   
I'll fight you! If you hate me, even as a Heroic Spirit!   
   
**Mordred:**   
I'll rebel against you as many times as I have to! &mdash;Arthur Pendragon!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's no good! We can't stop Mordred! I guess we have to fight...Good luck, you two!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Roger!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Master! ...Beginning combat!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jekyll:**   
I just got word from Dr. Roman. The operation was a success!   
   
**Jekyll:**   
They defeated Heroic Spirit Nikola Tesla,as well as another Servant that appeared from the Fog.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
And just now, they succeeded in removing the Holy Grail from Angrboda.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh...  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Huh? Is it just you? Where's Andersen and Shakespeare&mdash;  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Oh, I see. That's right. The Grail's been recovered. Singularity is fixed. Then, yup.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
The era is being restored. Everything that happened here will disappear.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
All the Servants will disappear,and our memories will probably change as well.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh, uh, uh...  
   
**Jekyll:**   
Yes...Yes. I see. Just this once, I think I understand what you're saying.   
   
**Fran:**   
...Uh...  
   
**Jekyll:**   
...Yes, you're right. It is a little sad.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Well, you know&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
Good work. You guys helped with a lot.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Londinium is saved. No one other than me could trample it.   
   
**Mordred:**   
And they all lived happily ever after. Bye.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, Mordred.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Hmm?   
   
**Mash:**   
I'll tell you...one thing. That last Servant was clearly out of control.   
   
**Mash:**   
It was probably the unique result of the Demonic Fog and Makiri Zolgen's last incantation.   
   
**Mash:**   
It didn't come here for any special reason or anything like that, I think.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...What? Are you trying to make me feel better?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Give it up. I don't want to end this by killing you.   
   
**Mash:**   
No, that's not it. I...No...That's not...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She said what she wanted to say.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Haha, I get it! I see! That's what I've said so many times!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah, you're right. You've got me there.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Okay, I won't kill you then. Dammit, I should've kept my mouth shut around Fran.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Oh? Isn't that a little too kind for the Treacherous Knight?   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I understood your character as being someone who slays anyone who offers pity, regardless of who it may be.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Nope. She's just easily taken in by a certain type of person. You can tell by looking at Fran, right?   
   
**Mordred:**   
...You're showing up after it's all over, huh? Fine. Line up so I can chop your heads off.   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Huh? I came to help you out of this latest danger,and I'm finding a bunch of weirdos.   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
Are those two Servants? Do you need my help?   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
Hahh, Hahh...Oh, jeez. Hold up, Kintoki. You're a little too fast&mdash;Geh.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Hmph. I think I may have seen those fox ears somewhere before...  
   
**Andersen:**   
Saber, if you want to kill Shakespeare, very well. But first, listen to me.   
   
**Andersen:**   
You'll want to defeat that fox-eared girl first. I don't know why, but I can see she's a hassle to deal with!   
   
**Mordred:**   
I'm killing you, too!   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
You really have it out for me,don't you? Hmmph, precocious brat!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hahaha. Sounds like you're busy. Well, the case is closed, so this is fit for a grand finale.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah. Everybody's so friendly.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Doctor, we need to recover the Holy Grail.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Oh, right. We need to finish recovering the Holy Grail.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There's no more threats in this era, so I wasn't...Wait. What's this response!?   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Everyone, be careful! There's some kind of distortion in the underground space!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
"Something" is coming! It's an unknown phenomenon! Not a Servant manifestation!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Unknown? No, it's actually more like a Rayshift? But that's impossible. Only Chaldea has that technology!   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? ...Senpai, something is strange. I have no anomalies, but I'm shivering&mdash;terribly&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...The space is opening! Here it comes!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**C：???:**  
Demon Marshal Gilles de Rais. Imperial Founder Romulus. Hero Spy Jason. And Divine Scholar Nikola Tesla.   
   
**C：???:**  
I thought they would be somewhat useful&mdash;But they spoiled my fun as they couldn't even clean house.   
   
**C：???:**  
Stupidity. Such stupidity. Humans really do degrade with the passage of time.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Dammit! Sheba won't stabilize! I can only get audio! What happened!? What's going on, Mash!?   
   
**Mash:**   
I-I don't know. There's a shadow that looks human,slowly walking towards us&mdash;  
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
...Get back, lady. That thing's bad news. It ain't something a good little girl should see.   
   
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**   
So it seems. I'll be leaving too. With only two tails, even seeing it is enough to taint me.   
   
**Sakata Kintoki:**   
(No, you're probably fine, right? Shouldn't you be going to the front? )  
   
**Mordred:**   
&mdash;Hey. What is this insane magical energy? It's a hell of a lot bigger than a dragon. It's like&mdash;  
   
**Shakespeare:**   
One of the demons or angels in the ancient stories. No, perhaps even greater.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
I was not born a mage but as a petty Caster I can understand.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
This magical energy is infinite. This domination crushes its surroundings merely by existing.   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Truly, truly a created being worthy of being called God! No, perhaps it is even God itself!   
   
**Shakespeare:**   
Am I wrong, my friend Andersen? I think it's time for us to be going!   
   
**Andersen:**   
Why do you always exaggerate so? There's all types of gods. Anyway, the only god I fear is the god of editors.   
   
**Andersen:**   
...Though I do agree it's time to run. I didn't expect to see the big boss at this stage.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The big boss!? What does that mean!? Fujimaru, tell me what's going on!   
   
**C：???:**  
I see. Like me, only your voice reaches them.   
   
**C：???:**  
Chaldea is isolated from the temporal axis,and so it's become a base that no one can find.   
   
**C：???:**  
My eyes see everything&mdash;and all possible futures,but even they have trouble perceiving Chaldea.   
   
**C：???:**  
That's why you survive. Pathetically, shamelessly, and uselessly.   
   
**C：???:**  
Intolerant of a history of destruction already decided,a pitiful boat still adrift in the sea of void.   
   
**C：???:**  
That is what you are, Chaldea,and what you are, Fujimaru.   
   
**C：???:**  
A stain upon the scorched ashes of human history. The name of the only fools left who would defy "my" deeds.   
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Doctor,what we're about to see is&mdash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who are you!?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you the "King" that Lev talked about?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**C：???:**  
Hmm? I thought you already had the answer? Are you so like monkeys that such a thing has to be taught?   
   
**C：???:**  
But very well. I've taken a liking to your stupidity. If you wish to ask, I shall answer you.   
   
**C：???:**  
I am the final destination you seek. The one who commands the 72 Demon Gods, and will destroy humanity from his throne.   
   
**C：???:**  
My name is Solomon. Among the Heroic Spirits,I stand above them all as one of the "Grand" seven.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
S&mdash;Solomon!? Are you sure that's what he said, Mash!?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, I'm sure.   
   
**Mash:**   
He said he was Solomon...Same as the king of ancient Israel, who was alive in the 10th century B. C.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No...Is it really Solomon? But...But that's impossible&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
Heh. I guess we've got a big name for a guest, huh? So what? Are you a Servant too?   
   
**Mordred:**   
You were summoned as a Heroic Spirit,and decided to use your 2nd life to destroy humanity?   
   
**Solomon:**   
No, Knight of Londinium. I am indeed a Heroic Spirit, but no man will ever summon me.   
   
**Mordred:**   
What?   
   
**Solomon:**   
Do not think me the same rank as you incompetents. After death, I revived by my own power to be a Heroic Spirit.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
D-Did he say...he revived by his own power!?   
   
**Solomon:**   
I am a Heroic Spirit, and also a living being. Thus, no Master commands me.   
   
**Solomon:**   
I started this matter of my own will. In order to eliminate all you humans&mdash;  
   
**Solomon:**   
Trash who's continuing along its foolish history. You are the sole and greatest waste of this universe.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You think you can do that!?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You can't destroy the world!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Solomon:**   
I can. I have the means,the will, and the reality.   
   
**Solomon:**   
Your eras have been swept away already,by my 72 Demon Gods that cross over time.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Cross over time...So those Demon Gods really were the demons in the Lemegeton?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But they're nothing like those in folklore! King Solomon's familiars can't be such ugly meat monsters!   
   
**Solomon:**   
How sad. You exist at the far end of time,and yet your interpretation is ancient.   
   
**Solomon:**   
The 72 Demon Gods took physical form and were reborn. That is why they can anchor themselves in any era.   
   
**Solomon:**   
The Demon Gods are wedges halting this planet's rotation. The spiraling band of light in the sky is my Noble Phantasm.   
   
**Mash:**   
Spiraling band of light in the sky Does he mean...that ring of light we see in every era&mdash;  
   
**Solomon:**   
Indeed. That is my Third Noble Phantasm. "Ars Almadel Salomonis. "  
   
**Solomon:**   
Each ray in the band carries the same heat as a holy sword. Light equivalent to weaving together hundreds of millions of the holy sword...  
   
**Solomon:**   
...held by King Arthur&mdash;the Servant you played with. In other words&mdash;an Anti-Humanity Noble Phantasm.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Tch...Hundreds of millions of times the heat of Father's holy sword&mdash; That's what you're using to incinerate time!?   
   
**Solomon:**   
&mdash;Hmph. You'll never see it, so I've no intention of answering.   
   
**Solomon:**   
I've answered your question. Now it's my turn, survivors of Chaldea.   
   
**Mordred:**   
He wants a fight! Get ready, Mash, Fujimaru!   
   
**Mordred:**   
He's the guy behind all this, right!? So our only option is to kill him here!   
   
**Mash:**   
B-But&mdash;That Servant...we can't&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash, get a hold of yourself! Stay strong and focus on the enemy!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No matter who they are, they're a Servant, right!? So you can win!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Heroic Spirit within you was chosen by the Holy Grail! He's a Heroic Spirit who won't be outranked by Solomon!   
   
**D：Solomon:**   
Hah&mdash;the rank of a Heroic Spirit? Do you really think that matters at all?   
   
**D：Solomon:**   
Ignorance is a sin. I thought some knowledge was there,but your commander seems to be a mage of little worth.   
   
**D：Solomon:**   
The only one I've any interest in now is you, girl with the shield.   
   
**D：Solomon:**   
Now let's have a fun little chat.   
   
**D：Solomon:**   
I'll do you a special favor. Out of respect for your pure heart, I'll only summon "four of them. "  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Solomon:**   
Do you see now? This is the inevitable result of a mere Heroic Spirit trying to challenge me.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Doctor, use the Rayshift. We're going to be wiped out!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I can't do it! The field around him is blocking the Rayshift anchor!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As long as Solomon's there,I can't bring you back!   
   
**Mash:**   
...At least...I can try to save Senpai&mdash;  
   
**Mordred:**   
That bastard is boasting!   
   
**Mordred:**   
But it's no bluff...Our ranks don't matter. His energy output is so much greater.   
   
**Mordred:**   
What the hell are you made of?   
   
**Solomon:**   
It's just like you said. It's not our ranks as Heroic Spirits. Our vessels, our Classes are what separate us.   
   
**Solomon:**   
Now burn, with the rest of the garbage.   
   
**Solomon:**   
Heroic Spirit Mordred, Kingslayer. I will take my time to incinerate you thoroughly.   
   
**Andersen:**   
...This is crazy. Just blocking him once did this to me? Figures I can't stand up to you as a Caster.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Brat!? What are you&mdash;  
   
**Andersen:**   
Just a whim. Don't worry about it. I owe you for all the work you've done.   
   
**Solomon:**   
...You're still alive, scribbler?   
   
**Solomon:**   
I thought I cleaned you up with the rest of the rabble. I'm amazed you survived, as weak as you are.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Hmph. I don't like physical labor, so I focused on watching. But it looks like I can't do that anymore.   
   
**Andersen:**   
But&mdash;I see through you, Solomon. I see what you really are, and the truth behind your exceptional nature.   
   
**Solomon:**   
Oh? Very well. Speak then, poet. If your words please me, I'll grant you an easy death.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Yeah, listen well you imbecile. This is what was written in the Clock Tower's records.   
   
**Andersen:**   
The Heroic Spirit Summons belong to the Counter Force. And the Counter Force is what protects humanity.   
   
**Andersen:**   
They manifest in seven vessels,to fight "just one" enemy.   
   
**Andersen:**   
What is that enemy? What else? The great disaster that threatens our world!   
   
**Andersen:**   
It is the avatar of the end, which destroys not this planet,but humanity and the civilization it has built!   
   
**Andersen:**   
It was born from civilization, and devours it&mdash;It is none other than a self-inflicted apoptosis.   
   
**Andersen:**   
To defeat it,the greatest of the Heroic Spirits are summoned.   
   
**Solomon:**   
&mdash;That's right. The seven Heroic Spirits are messengers from heaven, sent to destroy a certain wickedness.   
   
**Solomon:**   
Seven strongest from that era to protect humanity. The first seven at the pinnacle of Heroic Spirits.   
   
**Solomon:**   
The Heroic Spirit Summoning Ritual was originally an ultimate spell meant to save humanity.   
   
**Solomon:**   
The summoning system you use&mdash;the Holy Grail War is a degraded form of it, meant to serve human purposes.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Wha&mdash;You're saying we're degraded?   
   
**Andersen:**   
Don't fall for his taunts, Mordred. It's not an issue of rank, but of vessel and authority.   
   
**Andersen:**   
He is simply a Heroic Spirit manifested in a vessel one rank above our own.   
   
**Andersen:**   
If we are weapons meant to fight individuals,he is a weapon meant to fight the world&mdash;  
   
**Andersen:**   
He stands at the top of all Heroic Spirits of his alignment. In other words, he is a Servant with a "Grand" vessel.   
   
**Solomon:**   
Yes. You have done well to reach the truth!   
   
**D：Solomon:**   
I am the King of Kings, the Caster of Casters! You shall refer to me as this!   
   
**D：Solomon:**   
&mdash;The Grand Caster, Mage King Solomon!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A Grand Class!? Is he saying he was chosen by the Root!?   
   
**Solomon:**   
&mdash;Now then. Take your reward, poet. I shall tear you into a hundred pieces and burn you to a crisp.   
   
**Andersen:**   
Ggg&mdash;Gggawaahhh!   
   
**Mordred:**   
...You bastard.   
   
**Solomon:**   
Ordinary Servant, you're an utterly useless tool unless summoned by the living.   
   
**Solomon:**   
You lack the true freedom I possess. Do you now see the wall between us that you can never cross?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Tch&mdash;Hah. You're one to talk,considering you lost four Grails already.   
   
**Mordred:**   
You're only here because you're panicking that Fujimaru took half of your Grails, right?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Only losers whine when they get beat, you know?   
   
**Solomon:**   
&mdash;Are you the greatest fool in history?   
   
**Solomon:**   
I've lost four Grails? No. It will only matter if I lose them all.   
   
**Solomon:**   
One Grail, or six, it makes no difference to me. Fujimaru is far from a threat.   
   
**Solomon:**   
It's time for me to go. I wasted more time than I thought.   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh!? You're leaving? Why did you even come here!?   
   
**Solomon:**   
It was nothing more than a whim. Why?   
   
**Solomon:**   
Sometimes after finishing a book, you go to the bathroom before picking up the next, right? That's all this was.   
   
**Mordred:**   
What? You're saying you came to piss on us!?   
   
**Solomon:**   
&mdash;Hah.   
   
**Solomon:**   
Hahaha, Gwahahaha!   
   
**Solomon:**   
That's right! That's exactly right! But you're worth less than piss!   
   
**Solomon:**   
I don't care about you. I could kill you here, or not, and not care at all.   
   
**Solomon:**   
Do you understand? I'm not letting you go. You weren't worth looking at in the first place.   
   
**Solomon:**   
But&mdash;Hmph. But if you can remove all seven Singularities...  
   
**Solomon:**   
...Then I will consider you"a matter I must deal with. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Are we...saved? I hate to have him let us go, but it's best to just&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, Fujimaru!?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why are you doing this!?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is incinerating the world fun!?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai!   
   
**Solomon:**   
&mdash;Oh. That's a surprising reaction, human.   
   
**Solomon:**   
You ask if it's fun? You ask me if destroying humanity is fun?   
   
**D：Solomon:**   
Oh&mdash;Of course! Of course! Of course! Of course! It's the greatest fun in the world!   
   
**D：Solomon:**   
If it wasn't fun,would I take my time killing each one of you?   
   
**D：Solomon:**   
I'm having fun. Your deaths make me happy.   
   
**D：Solomon:**   
Your end pleases me. Your final gasps bring me more joy than anything!   
   
**D：Solomon:**   
And,this is the greatest salvation you could find.   
   
**D：Solomon:**   
Because only I alone can make good use of every single human being&mdash;!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Get back, Fujimaru! There's no point in talking to him! He's rotten to the core!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Mage King Solomon. You're no different than Lev Lainur.   
   
**Mash:**   
You have no gratitude towards life. You enjoy toying with the lives of humans and of the planet!   
   
**Solomon:**   
&mdash;  
   
**Solomon:**   
Girl, speak not of life as a mere human. When death is inevitable for you, your view has no value.   
   
**Solomon:**   
Gratitude towards life? That's my question for you.   
   
**Solomon:**   
What have you done for the last 2,000 years? You've continuously died, and continuously done nothing.   
   
**Solomon:**   
You are sentient creatures who failed to conquer death. And yet you retain your fear of it.   
   
**Solomon:**   
If you cannot conquer death,you should have abandoned your fear of it.   
   
**Solomon:**   
If you understand death to be a shameful, terrifying thing, then you should throw away your sentience!   
   
**Solomon:**   
It's pathetic. Simply pathetic. You're no different either, Master of Chaldea.   
   
**Solomon:**   
Why do you fight? Knowing your life will end. Knowing it has ended.   
   
**Solomon:**   
Why do you cling to life,when you know that your future holds no salvation?   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Solomon:**   
You are so young, human. You, Fujimaru, are humanity's final Master.   
   
**Solomon:**   
And this is my one warning to you.   
   
**Solomon:**   
Know that giving up on everything here is the easiest way for you to live.   
   
**Solomon:**   
&mdash;Burn, and leave not even ash. That is your future.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...This is the end. I feel unsatisfactory, though we got the Grail back.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I'm sorry.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Idiot. Don't you apologize. I'm the one who's stupid.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...You're right.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah. I haven't been this down since my Father's spear&mdash; No, never mind. Never mind.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
But well, we saved London. Not bad, considering who I am.   
   
**Mordred:**   
What I hate is that it's ending here. Honestly, I wanted to go with you guys...  
   
**Mordred:**   
But I'm at my limit, as you can see. With the Singularity gone, there's no place for me.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I was summoned here by the Grail's fog. Without a Master, I have to disappear.   
   
**Mordred:**   
...I hate to say it, but he's right. We can't fight unless we're summoned.   
   
**Mordred:**   
That's the limit of a Heroic Spirit, and a Servant.   
   
**Mordred:**   
In every era, the ones who build things...are always people living on the cutting edge of the future.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Mordred  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Living people...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Yeah. That's why&mdash;you're going to get there, Fujimaru.   
   
**Mordred:**   
You'll reach the place we can't go. You'll cross over the seven Grails and reach the end of time.   
   
**Mordred:**   
And then you'll corner that bastard Grand Caster. It's something only you can do.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Mordred.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Don't make that face, Mash. I don't like that Shield Bastard, but you're different.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Someday we'll meet again. When that happens, I'll help you.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Bye, Fujimaru. Even someone like me was able to save London.   
   
**Mordred:**   
So with a little bit of work,you'll be able to save the world.   
   
**Mash:**   
...All Servant responses are lost. Senpai, our Order in this era is complete...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Ahem. Test, test. Yes! Finally got video.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You two okay? You're okay, right? None of your vitals seem off.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The Demonic Fog is back to normal fog. There's nothing left for you in that era.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'm starting the Rayshift now. Anything left for you to do? Nothing, right?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Okay, initiating Rayshift! Congrats on completing your mission!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Welcome back, you two. You're both fine...well, maybe not. But I'm glad you're here.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
By the way, why are you here, Da Vinci?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Um, where's Dr. Roman?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Romani? Oh, Romani. He's...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
How...How could this happen?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
He's a mess, as you can see. Go snap him out of it, would you?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Get a grip, Doctor!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You really are a chicken, huh Doctor?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ywaah!? W-When did you two get here!? ...Oh, right. Leonardo did it for me...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Sorry. You were the ones in danger. It's just...It was such a shock...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Right, right. Enough gloom. They'll get really tired of it soon, you know?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Y-Yeah...I'm...Sorry, Mash, Fujimaru.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I should've done a forced Rayshift earlier,but my judgment was too slow...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's okay.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You couldn't help it.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But if Solomon had really tried to kill you...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Wah...I'm...I'm no good!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Doctor. No, stop staring at the ground.   
   
**Mash:**   
We are able to continue our mission because you are here.   
   
**Mash:**   
It's true that you're a bit of a coward,and a pessimist, too.   
   
**Mash:**   
You're a chicken. And kind of a wimp for a guy...  
   
**Mash:**   
Also, your hobbies are far too introverted,and you're way too dependent on that cyber-idol.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh...  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Um...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash, show some mercy...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But&mdash;The staff left at Chaldea can only do their best because you're doing your best.   
   
**Mash:**   
When Chaldea was bombed, you were the one who got the power back up in the fire, saved the survivors, and took command.   
   
**Mash:**   
You have only one fault. You give yourself just a bit too little credit.   
   
**Mash:**   
Chaldea is only here because of Romani Archaman. You saved the lives of everyone here.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's what I think.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's right.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You said "what you were thinking. "  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, Senpai.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Thanks, Mash, Fujimaru. Then, I don't have time to be depressed. Yeah.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We know who's behind this all now. There must be some reason for his extreme strength.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's continue the mission. We'll fix the remaining Singularities and stop the world and future from incineration.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...No matter what that man,Mage King Solomon, tries to do.   
   
**Mash:**   
The Grand Caster. He is our true enemy&mdash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Next time we win!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We won't lose again.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah! That's the spirit, Fujimaru.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay, it's a little late to say this,but great work this time, guys!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We'll handle the cleanup. You guys get some rest, ASAP.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
When you wake up, it'll be time for the Fifth Singularity. See you then!   
   
**Mash:**   
...We've reached our rooms. Senpai, thanks for your endless work.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You too, Mash.   
   
**Mash:**   
No. I'm a Demi-Servant. Physically, I'm fine.   
   
**Mash:**   
If you can call exhaustion and drained magical energy...tired...then maybe I am tired.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's fine. I'm not that tired.   
   
**Mash:**   
Um...I'm sorry. I meant that more as an idiom.   
   
**Mash:**   
And I do think you're tired. Get some rest in your room.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Um. I'm sorry. There was something I had to talk to you about.   
   
**Mash:**   
...What did you think about what Solomon said? About making use of humanity.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's stupid.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...What did you think?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I...I couldn't say that he was wrong.   
   
**Mash:**   
I don't understand it myself. But there was something in his words I can't ignore...  
   
**Mash:**   
Life is meaningless, and the future holds no salvation...It sounds so pessimistic, but he was full of hope.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm sorry. The battle just got started, and I'm being weird.   
   
**Mash:**   
Good night, Master. I hope I see you bright and full of energy tomorrow.
