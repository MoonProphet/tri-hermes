# Singularity 2: Eternal Mandess Empire - Septem  
  
## Prelude  
   
**Fou:**   
Kyuuu! Kyau!   
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning. Did you sleep well, Senpai?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, like a log.   
   
**Mash:**   
Glad to hear it. I'm happy to know that you got plenty of rest.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well enough.   
   
**Mash:**   
Is that right? Senpai, you must rest as much as possible.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Fou!   
   
**Mash:**   
As you can see, Fou is also fired up. I'm sure he's had more than enough sleep and breakfast.   
   
**Mash:**   
We don't know what it'll be like beyond the Rayshift. No telling when or how much we can rest.   
   
**Mash:**   
So as much as possible, please get enough sleep.   
   
**Mash:**   
Staying up late is prohibited, since your magical energy is linked to your stamina.   
   
**Mash:**   
And, umm&ndash;about that dream...  
   
**Mash:**   
Did you see something?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Dream? Why?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No, not really...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
It's not like I saw anything special. It's just...  
   
**Mash:**   
Da Vinci says that Masters and Servants under contract see the same dream.   
   
**Mash:**   
I don't know what that means...But if you didn't see one, then there's no problem.   
   
**Mash:**   
Let's go to the command room after breakfast. The Doctor's eagerly waiting.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah, good morning, everyone. Although by that, I mean just you two and...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yawn! Oh, 'morning...The tech department is analyzing the Grail you've retrieved as we speak.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...That half-asleep genius, and myself. Please pardon the work crew for not being very reliable.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We're already set to Rayshift. This time you're headed to 1st Century Europe.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Specifically Ancient Rome, the great empire that grew from Italy to control the Mediterranean Sea.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hm? Ancient Rome? Really? That sounds like fun! I sort of want to go, too!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You have analyzing to do, I believe. Please partake of Roman pleasures some other time.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, darn it. I don't care which one,but I always wanted to chat with a Roman Emperor.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Especially Emperor Caligula or Nero. I bet we'd have a lot in common.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, I feel the same...No, we can't. You also have work to do reviving Chaldea.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ahem! Is that clear, Fujimaru. Your teleport point is the Imperial Capital Rome.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The name of the Roman Empire's capital is also Rome. It's geographically similar to the last time.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The exact location of the supposedly existing Holy Grail is unknown. There may be historical changes as well.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Neither can be determined. Sorry, the observation precision seems unstable.   
   
**Mash:**   
Not a problem. Either way, Senpai and I will locate it.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Right, that's the spirit. You really are reliable.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Similar to the last mission, you'll reach and correct the singularity. Also, find the Grail, and either obtain or destroy it.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Humanity's continuation is on your shoulders. I hope you're successful this time, too.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And...That you come back safely.   
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Yes. We'll make it back to Chaldea, I promise.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm counting on you, Senpai. I'll need your strength for this mission.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Leave it to me.   
   
**Mash:**   
Okay!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's rather your strength we need, Mash.   
   
**Mash:**   
No, that's...The fact is, running this mission requires your judgment and leadership.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No doubt, Servants will be summoned during the 1st Century Rome as well.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If possible, call upon their power. Of course, you won't get help from hostile ones.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, I have one question. May I ask it?   
   
**Mash:**   
Hostile Servants and neutral Servants. Is there a way to distinguish them upon detection?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It would be best if we had the ability to distinguish them from our observation data.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
For example, the ability to see if approaching Servants are enemies or possible allies&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I am sorry. Unfortunately, that's impossible right now.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even if we combine Sheba and Trismegistus, the best we can do is to detect lifeforms and energy readings.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The ability to distinguish hostility, that lies within the realm of psychology.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
For now, you can't quantify that with numbers. I'm sorry, Mash, Fujimaru.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But, we can speculate from the situation. I'll warn you if there's over 70% chance of hostility.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As for non-Servant readings of local humans, I will try my best to detect them as well.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's okay, Doctor. I'm sorry for asking too much of you.   
   
**Mash:**   
I realize it was logically unreasonable. But, even so...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It was to reduce the danger, right?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Was it to avoid fighting?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Strategically speaking,it's best to avoid unnecessary battles.   
   
**Mash:**   
But no, I knew it was an unreasonable request. Please forget it.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, forgive me. I know I'm putting you in unreasonable danger...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
To the best of my ability, I'll support and back you up.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I can promise you that much at least. Mash, Fujimaru.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Understood!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Thank you.... Well, let's start the Rayshift.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Dr. Roman.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Quit being so gloomy! I'll back you up mentally, as well!   
   
**Mash:**   
No, that's...It's just the sudden shift in mood is a little...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Program start!   
   
**Announcement A:**   
Unsummon Program start. Spiritron Conversion start.   
   
**Announcement A:**   
Rayshift starting in 3, 2, 1...  
   
**Announcement A:**   
All procedures cleared. Grand Order commencing operation.   
   
## Section 1: Windy Hill   
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Ahh. We've successfully teleported this time, Senpai.   
   
**Mash:**   
The feel of the wind, the scent of earth&mdash;the vast blue sky.   
   
**Mash:**   
...It's strange. I've seen it on film so many times,but just standing here, it's so much more vivid.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong? You're breathing deeply.   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? Was I? I-I see. I'm sure I was doing it without thinking.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So Rayshifting makes you nervous?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Rayshifting makes me nervous. But, I don't think my state of mind has anything to do with that.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...I mean, I feel overwhelmed.   
   
**Mash:**   
In France, it was one shock after another. So now it's like I'm finally able to face this landscape.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...Kyu, kyu?   
   
**Mash:**   
Fou?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You tagged along again?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Did you just pop out of Mash's chest?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Kyu! Kyau!   
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like Fou will be tagging along again. He prefers the outside world to that cramped base.   
   
**Mash:**   
I can agree with that sentiment.   
   
**Mash:**   
Battles can be scary, but it makes me happy to discover new worlds like this.   
   
**Mash:**   
...But "that" is visible in the sky in this era as well, isn't it?   
   
**Mash:**   
That ring of light. It's the same as the one that was over France.   
   
**Mash:**   
No, I mean it looks the same. Not that I've examined it precisely.   
   
**Mash:**   
I wonder what it could be? It's such a huge&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ring of light, huh? As usual, we can't get a good look at it from here.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But it is an intriguing phenomenon. I will continue to investigate.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
By the way, is that...Oh? Weren't you suppose to be in...Rome?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uh, we're in the hills.   
   
**Mash:**   
You're right Senpai. We're in the hills.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I wonder?   
   
**Mash:**   
No Senpai, I don't believe this is the ancient Roman capital. We're in the hills.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's weird, I confirmed it from here as well. That's not the capital.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm sure that I fixed your teleport position...Uh, looks like that's a suburb of the Roman capital.   
   
**Mash:**   
Was there an error in the coordinates? Is the era correct?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The era's correct. Definitely the 1st Century where the singularity exists.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
During the reign of Nero Claudius&ndash;fifth emperor of Rome. That's for certain.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Still, this is strange. Why are we so far from the capital?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Despite the poisoning of Empress Aggripina last year, Nero isn't in his dangerously declining years yet.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
An era where the emperor is loved, and the city of Rome is prosperous...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...that's what should've been awaiting you.   
   
**Mash:**   
No Doctor, it's just rolling hills. All it needs is some sheep to complete it.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There must be some reason for this. Do you see anything unusual in the surroundings?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou!   
   
**Mash:**   
...I hear it.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What?   
   
**Mash:**   
This is&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A battle somewhere?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you hear something?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I think it's the sound of a large battle. It seems to be coming from over the hill.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A large battle? A war, maybe? No, no, no. Impossible.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There were no full-scale wars near the Roman capital in that era.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That means&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
There's a historical anomaly. That must be it.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's get to that noise!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's...  
   
**Mash:**   
No doubt about it, they're in combat. One side is overwhelmingly larger than the other.   
   
**Mash:**   
The larger force wears regalia of crimson and gold. The small wears the same, but a different design.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Crimson and gold were colors especially liked in Ancient Rome. Mash, anything else that's distinctive?   
   
**Mash:**   
...A woman. Several groups of the smaller force are being led by a young woman.   
   
**Mash:**   
She's practically taking on the enemy forces herself. The overwhelming avalanche towards the capital, all by herself.   
   
**Mash:**   
An extremely strong individual. A Servant, perhaps.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, I am not getting any readings on Servants. You don't sense it either, do you?   
   
**Mash:**   
Correct.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Then it's certain. That woman is a human of this era.   
   
**Mash:**   
This is just personal speculation&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
But she reminds me a bit of Jeanne. I've no basis for it, though.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Of Jeanne? The saint who rose to defend the sacred?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmmm, who of this era was like that...I can't think of one. My knowledge is lacking.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In any case, an impossible war is going on.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Which means&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's help that woman.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We must stop the city from being overrun.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I agree with your firm policy, Senpai. Even Fou's fired up.   
   
**Fou:**   
Kyuu! Kyu kyu, kyu!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You aren't facing Servants or monsters,but they have great numbers. Be careful!   
   
**Mash:**   
Right!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**D：???:**  
Sheathe your swords! It's over. You there! Are you reinforcements from the capital?   
   
**D：???:**  
I thought the capital was sealed off...No matter, I commend you!   
   
**D：???:**  
It doesn't matter if you were once my enemy. I am merciful, so past mistakes are water under the bridge.   
   
**D：???:**  
More importantly, I praise the way you fought just now. For a girl to brandish a weapon larger than herself...  
   
**D：???:**  
Umu, I must say I like you! You showed such indescribable, aberrant beauty!   
   
**D：???:**  
Very good, I shall allow you to fight by my side. Revel in the ultimate honor!   
   
**D：???:**  
...Still, you people sure dress in a strange fashion. Aren't you showing a little too much? Are you foreigners?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We are beyond words for your generous praise.   
   
**D：???:**  
Yes, yes. You may enjoy wallowing in the sweet sounds I utter.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're reinforcements, just passing by.   
   
**D：???:**  
What perfect timing! Do you serve Boudica,perhaps? Her moves are beyond shrewd.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**D：???:**  
At any rate, this victory belongs to us. I will reward you handsomely!   
   
**D：???:**  
Oh, uh, sorry.... I couldn't help myself just now.   
   
**D：???:**  
You'll have to wait for your reward. Since I have nothing but this sword at the moment.   
   
**D：???:**  
It will all be taken care of after we're back in Rome. Now then, follow me!   
   
## Section 2: All Roads Lead to Rome   
   
**D：???:**  
By the way, you people. I don't doubt that you're foreigners, but where are you from?   
   
**D：???:**  
Surely not...Britannia. The Far East...doesn't seem likely, either.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're from Chaldea.   
   
**D：???:**  
Chaldea?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're from the future.   
   
**D：???:**  
What? If that's true, we're going to have a problem. You have my sympathies, but did you fall down the stairs perhaps?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
That's enough small talk. We still have many enemies to deal with, the second wave is coming.   
   
**D：???:**  
Damn those restless United Empire fools! How dare they interrupt my beautiful voice!   
   
**D：???:**  
Let's go! You! Very striking-looking girl,I order you to serve as my shield!   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? Uh, right!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai, now we're the ones under command somehow!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**D：???:**  
...Somehow we're out of the danger. You ended up saving the day again.   
   
**D：???:**  
I'm sure it's not uncommon to be outnumbered in war, but being on the inferior side is no fun. So tiring!   
   
**Mash:**   
No, it's not over yet. I can sense more coming!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A Servant, Mash, Fujimaru! I've detected a single Servant!   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. I'm sensing it. It's almost...there it is!   
   
**E：???:**  
&ndash;My beloved younger sister's child.   
   
**D：???:**  
Uncle!   
   
**D：???:**  
No...No, no, let me call you this now. You fool who inexplicably lost his way, aligning with the United Empire!   
   
**D：???:**  
..."Caligula! "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What did she just say? Uncle? Is that what she said?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I'm sure that's what I heard. A human living in this era, and a blood relative&ndash;of a Servant?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's look into that later, Mash. No question about it, that's a Servant.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru, are you ready? This is our first Servant battle since coming to this era.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ready when you are!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm still not used to this, but I have no choice.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No need to worry, Senpai. No, Master.   
   
**Caligula:**   
My&ndash;  
   
**Caligula:**   
My actions are destiny.   
   
**Caligula:**   
Give up your, life. Give up that body.   
   
**Caligula:**   
All of it   
   
**Caligula:**   
Give it up!   
   
**D：???:**  
Uncle, how could you?   
   
**Mash:**   
Here he comes! It's a Servant Battle. Master, your orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Caligula:**   
Oh...Oh. My beloved...younger sister's...child...  
   
**Caligula:**   
Why won't you...give it to me? Why can't you give it to me?   
   
**Caligula:**   
My beautiful...My...My...My...My...  
   
**D：???:**  
H-He's gone? Uncle...  
   
**Mash:**   
I can no longer sense his presence. The enemy troops seem to be withdrawing as well.   
   
**D：???:**  
...My uncle must've been the general of that battalion. I didn't think I'd ever see him again.   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Looks like he turned into a Spiritual Body and left. Or fled rather, good work.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Berserker class from the looks of him. If so, it's hard to believe that he'd flee...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Could it be that...He has a Master?   
   
**D：???:**  
Hmm. Huh?   
   
**Mash:**   
Wh-What is it?   
   
**D：???:**  
There's a man around here, who can be heard but not seen. From the feel of it, maybe a Mage?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I am glad you know of magecraft. Yes, these two and myself are from an organization called Chaldea&ndash;  
   
**D：???:**  
That's all right. You two, no, three over there!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hey, you interrupted me...  
   
**D：???:**  
I'm not sure about the one with no body, but the two of you fought marvelously. I praise you again!   
   
**D：???:**  
Before I ask your lineage, I'll offer my own. I am&ndash;  
   
**D：???:**  
The true protector of Rome. Truly, I am Rome itself.   
   
**D：???:**  
I swear to rebuild the empire. Yes, this I swear to the gods, my ancestors, to myself, and to the people!   
   
**Nero:**   
I am Nero Claudius,fifth emperor of the Roman Empire&ndash;!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Gasp)  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(I knew it. )  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Heh heh heh, are you surprised? You are surprised!   
   
**Nero:**   
Of course, of course. Very good. Be as surprised and amazed as you like. I shall allow it.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Emperor Nero.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Was...a girl...History...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Is deep...  
   
## Section 3: Eternal City   
   
**Nero:**   
Take a good look and be struck with awe! This is my city, a glorious regime that even young girls extol!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It does seem incredibly vibrant!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Everyone seems to be laughing!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Yes, yes, didn't I tell you? After all, this is the greatest city in the world!   
   
**Nero:**   
First, there was Septem Montes&ndash;Such words existed like so.   
   
**Nero:**   
And that's where it all started. Our glorious history began with our divine ancestors and those hills.   
   
**Nero:**   
And...Hey, shopkeeper, I'm taking one of these apples.   
   
**Shopkeeper:**   
Welcome to my...Oh! Your Majesty! Please,take as you wish. Glory to the Emperor and Rome!   
   
**Nero:**   
Shopkeeper, you don't have to be so stiff. Yes, yes, this is a delicious apple.   
   
**Nero:**   
Why don't you take one too? We're returning from war,so no need to worry about bad manners.   
   
**Nero:**   
Sweet fruit does wonders for battle fatigue. My wounds won't be healed, but my motivation will!   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, no thank you. But I appreciate the gesture...  
   
**Nero:**   
Then how about that [♂ man /♀ woman] over there? They're delicious, don't be shy.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you.   
   
**Nero:**   
Ah, that is a wonderful apple.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll eat it later.   
   
**Nero:**   
Really? That's pretty modest of you.   
   
**Nero:**   
Well, for me? I'm usually humble about things too, you know?   
   
**Nero:**   
But I want to show off a little&mdash;ahem. A-Anyway.   
   
**Mash:**   
(She's cute...)  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(How cute...)  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Umu. Once again, I like you.   
   
**Nero:**   
Honestly, I'm unclear about what you speak of...But I can tell that you and that girl are honest people.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's a relief to hear you say that, Emperor Nero.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It might be best to think of us simply as a mage and his pupils.   
   
**Nero:**   
Is that so? Then let us forget this confusing talk of Masters and Servants.   
   
**Nero:**   
You are the mage's pupils, and the mage speaks from a distant land.   
   
**Nero:**   
And? You also said your goal&ndash;is to aid me?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. You aren't wrong about that.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The center of the world, and the world itself. The name of the greatest empire that rules the world is Rome.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In this era, there should be no threat to the city. The Grail's influence must be upsetting events.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If I am right, this era's singularity is probably the existence of the great Roman Empire.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
An empire that greatly influenced later generations. Stopping its destruction would fix the singularity.   
   
**Nero:**   
...Mm, Mm Mm...  
   
**Nero:**   
...S-Sorry, I don't quite understand. Please speak a bit more in my range of understanding.   
   
**Mash:**   
Sorry, he can be a bit too theoretical...I'll explain.   
   
**Mash:**   
We seek something called the Holy Grail, a magical item with special powers.   
   
**Mash:**   
It's causing a great many disturbances just by being here.   
   
**Mash:**   
The odds are great that the Grail is the problem eating away at Rome now.   
   
**Nero:**   
...I see. This Holy Grail is damaging my Rome.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. It must sound astounding to you...  
   
**Nero:**   
No, neither strange nor weird. This Holy Grail. It strangely...Worries me...  
   
**Nero:**   
Never mind, a needless concern of mine. It's just a nightmare I had once.   
   
**Nero:**   
Right. Come with me,let's talk freely in my home.   
   
**Nero:**   
...Wait, what? Is there something wrong at the market?   
   
**Shopkeeper:**   
H-Hey! What's this! What are you people doing to my shop!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?   
   
**Nero:**   
How dare you do this to my Rome, and my people! Are they enemy spies? Either way, it's unforgivable!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai, we should go too! The townsfolk are being attacked!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nero:**   
&ndash;Now then. My Rome is currently endangered.   
   
**Nero:**   
My great empire's territories are now, vexingly enough, ripped apart and scattered all over.   
   
**Nero:**   
On one hand, there is the true Roman Empire that I rule over. The area centered around this capital, Rome.   
   
**Nero:**   
On the other hand, there is an alliance controlled by multiple "emperors", that suddenly appeared out of nowhere.   
   
**Nero:**   
The United Roman Empire. That's what they called themselves when they stole half of my empire.   
   
**Nero:**   
The United Empire is still a mystery to us. No matter how many scouts we send out, none ever return.   
   
**Nero:**   
Even the location of the capital where these fake emperors gather is unknown to us.   
   
**Mash:**   
Multiple emperors, you say?   
   
**Nero:**   
That's right. In my eyes, they're just a group of treacherous bandits.    
   
**Nero:**   
And...  
   
**Nero:**   
...No, it's not worth mentioning. Just rebels spreading their vicious lies.   
   
**Nero:**   
They call themselves emperors, but they're just pretenders.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You look troubled.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is something bothering you?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai.   
   
**Nero:**   
No, it's fine. You saw one of them before.   
   
**Nero:**   
Caligula, the enemy general. The man who singlehandedly slaughtered my forces before you arrived.   
   
**Nero:**   
He's one of the traitors who calls himself "emperor. "As well as being...  
   
**Nero:**   
...my uncle.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Shouldn't he be dead already?   
   
**Nero:**   
Yes, dear formless mage. That is correct.   
   
**Nero:**   
Even our Court Mage was killed by Uncle Caligula, but if he was still alive you might have gotten along well.   
   
**Nero:**   
Our mage boasted that he had overcome death. In truth, he showed me some impressive spells.   
   
**Nero:**   
But...He was killed by that one "emperor's" sword.   
   
**Nero:**   
A master of spells who shouldn't have died, yet died easily.... It shouldn't be possible, yet, he did.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
To easily beat a mage of this era...That's no ordinary human. It's a Servant.   
   
**Mash:**   
That must be causing the historical anomaly. One of the "emperors" got hold of the Grail.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's highly likely that is the cause of this era's singularity.   
   
**Nero:**   
Honestly, the United Empire is very strong. Violent battles are occurring all over and the people suffer.   
   
**Nero:**   
I've dispatched all my serving viceroys and generals, and thrown nearly every troop at them. Yet the United Empire's power is undiminished.   
   
**Nero:**   
Recently, an expeditionary force of theirs pressed in on the capital. They even managed to get inside.   
   
**Nero:**   
I only had a few of my troops to defend us.   
   
**Nero:**   
I hate to say it...But it showed me that this situation is beyond my ability to break by myself.   
   
**Nero:**   
Therefore. I order you, no, I implore you!   
   
**Nero:**   
Become my generals! Then Rome and I shall assist you in obtaining this Holy Grail!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Such a heaven-sent proposal. It seems we have a common cause.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's right. What do you think, Senpai?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's cooperate.   
   
**Nero:**   
Ah, I see! I see! That's a quick response!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do we get a salary?   
   
**Nero:**   
Of course. As soon as the United Empire is beaten,I shall give you what you desire.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I shall grant one of you the title of viceroy, as well as reward for the work you've already done.   
   
**Nero:**   
Rest well tonight. I shall prepare quarters suitable for a viceroy for you.   
   
**Nero:**   
Oh yes, will the invisible mage require them as well?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Don't worry about me. Supplying a room for those two will be enough.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
By the way Your Majesty, have you ever heard the name Lev Lainur?   
   
**Nero:**   
...Lev? No I haven't, who is he?   
   
**Mash:**   
A mage of our era. He betrayed Chaldea and all humanity.   
   
**Mash:**   
There's a chance he's in this era. Although, I don't know if he's revealed himself or taken any action.   
   
**Nero:**   
A mage from a foreign land? ...Hmm.   
   
**Nero:**   
I've heard there is a powerful mage in the United Empire. It's only a rumor, but someone saw that mage on the front lines.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...It's possible. Your Majesty, I have a request.   
   
**Nero:**   
Speak.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'd like Mash and Fujimaru to be deployed as close to the front lines as possible.   
   
**Nero:**   
I don't mind, but...Will Fujimaru be all right?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Lev Lainur is our enemy.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We owe him some payback.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, Master.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The Director will be avenged.   
   
**Mash:**   
...That's right. We can't let him go after the way he killed the Director.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Very well. Nero Claudius will honor your request.   
   
**Nero:**   
I shall pray to the gods and divine ancestors of Rome that your enemy be defeated.   
   
**Nero:**   
But first, how about a feast before you rest!   
   
**Nero:**   
Not as grand as usual due to the war, but it will still be a feast where I spare no efforts.   
   
**Nero:**   
Fujimaru, Mash, do you drink? We have something special imported from the Orient!   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, uh, no drinking for me thanks...  
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
Your Majesty! The eastern city gate is under attack by a mid-size United Empire force!   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
I think they're remnants of that expeditionary force! Our eastern gate can't hold them back!   
   
**Nero:**   
...Grr. Just as I was about to have a rare pleasant feast.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Go Mash, Fujimaru. Looks like your time has come.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It won't be unusual if another Servant shows up as an enemy general. Stay on guard!   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood.... Senpai, shall we?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go, Mash!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes!   
   
**Nero:**   
I'm counting on you Viceroy Fujimaru. Show those skills you demonstrated before!   
   
**Nero:**   
The feast can wait! We'll look forward to it!   
   
**Mash:**   
Enemy forces sighted. They're in battle formation.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You're facing human forces, not Servants or monsters. Take it easy on them you two.   
   
**Mash:**   
Got it. Master, your commands please.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
The sun is setting, but it seems the attack isn't over yet.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm worried about the enemy's numbers. Keep an eye on Fujimaru's stamina and magical energy consumption.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes Doctor. Master, try not to exert yourself too much.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...It's getting dark, huh?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The enemy isn't letting up. As expected in the age of close combat, they all have incredible stamina!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Still, this is where you need to make your stand. Don't let your guard down, Fujimaru!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...Whew. The enemy is retreating.   
   
**Mash:**   
There didn't seem to be any Servants among them. They were all human soldiers.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No mages that could be Lev, huh? Anyway, good job. It's gotten really dark.   
   
**Mash:**   
Let's head back, Senpai. If there's a night raid, we'll be in for another battle.   
   
**Mash:**   
You should rest while you can. Didn't I tell you as much this morning?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes, you did.   
   
**Mash:**   
Okay.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm not sleepy yet...  
   
**Mash:**   
What?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hahaha! Then I think I'll go back to my room and sleep.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I have to check Magi☆Mari's blog too. She should've updated her diary by now...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Doctor...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wh-Why are you looking at me like some sort of pitiful creature? What's wrong with internet idols?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They're truly the ideal "idols," untainted by the hand of the media, TV networks, or even morals!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Isn't the outside world destroyed?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You've noticed a vital point. The outside world has definitely been destroyed.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Which means Magi☆Mari and that HP will no longer be updated...Is that what you think?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fool! Magi☆Mari is a supreme idol who has transcended beyond this world's circumstances!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Well actually, she's been recreated as an auto-generated AI from her original data.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, it's not my place to comment on the hobby of a 30-year old bachelor, but please do your job.   
   
**Mash:**   
Otherwise, I'll be forced to delete that "secret" folder of yours.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
C-Come on now, it's a joke! I'm always checking your surroundings and finding data!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyway, get some rest you two. The Emperor's also waiting for your report.   
   
## Section 4: Burning Mountain   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good morning Your Majesty, I actually have an important favor to ask of you.   
   
**Nero:**   
Umu, ask me anything! I am quite generous!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In order to stabilize our activities in this era, I'd like to go to Mount Etna.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A leyline crucial to our mission exists in that volcano.   
   
**Nero:**   
Etna, huh? The Court Mage used to go to Etna a lot too. Hmm, but why?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We need to set a terminal point.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So we can bolster our troops.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero:**   
I see. I'm not sure I understand, but I'll grant you permission.   
   
**Nero:**   
If you go to Etna, will it be for me and for the sake of my Rome?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Your Majesty. Of course.   
   
**Nero:**   
Very well. While my investigation of the United Empire prevents me from going&ndash;  
   
**Nero:**   
You may do as you wish. Be prepared for enemy soldiers along the way.   
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you very much.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foooou!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...We arrived more easily than expected. Isn't this a vital region to the United Empire?   
   
**Mash:**   
Wait Doctor, it looks like something's already swarming around the leyline!   
   
**Mash:**   
That's&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ghost-type monsters? If it's naturally occurring, that's quite a leyline!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's eliminate them!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Secure the leyline!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Roger Master! Initiating combat!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
The battle is over. Now I'll create a terminal point&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Hm. Huh?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Da Vinci's not coming out. Oh, could it be that this time it's...  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He must be busy with Sheba's maintenance, so I guess he doesn't have the time.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou...  
   
**Mash:**   
I've completed the summoning circle. Now we can secure combat personnel even in this era.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Now then, let's return to Rome. Thank goodness there were fewer battles than I expected.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What? No, wait, I am still detecting some magical energy.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Did it get drawn by the energy that was leaking before the circle was established?   
   
**???:**  
...Oh...oh...oh!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai, the opponent is a non-physical type. Your battle commands!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;No sign of any nearby enemies.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This time we're safe for sure. Let's head down while keeping an eye out for enemy soldiers.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Foooou!   
   
**Mash:**   
United Roman Empire...They seem to have taken in Servants.   
   
**Mash:**   
Who is the mastermind anyway? Is it Lev Lainur, or perhaps&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I still can't pick up anything, but if there's a Servant here it'd be hard to avoid combat.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Servants are being implemented in wars without hesitation. This is clearly unusual.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If you weren't here, the emperor would've been killed for sure.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Please do your best, I'll proceed with my analysis.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Understood.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do your best, Doctor.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**Nero:**   
Ah, you're back, Fujimaru.   
   
**Nero:**   
I know you only just returned, but I'm thinking of launching an expedition to Gaul.   
   
**Nero:**   
It's to aid and give encouragement to my fellow subordinates. Of course, if I don't go there's no point.   
   
**Nero:**   
I'd like Fujimaru and Mash to join me. Well? Will you come?   
   
**Mash:**   
...What should we do, Senpai?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The emperor's given me details of the situation. Gaul seems to be a front line in the war with the United Empire.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There's a chance that the Servant with the Grail could be rampaging there. Lev could be there too.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I think you should go with her. Naturally, it'll be dangerous, but&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It can't be helped.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'll do our best and be careful.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Right Senpai, I agree.   
   
**Nero:**   
It's decided! An imperial expedition! Prepare at once!   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
Yes, Your Majesty!   
   
## Section 5: Onward to Gaul   
   
**Nero:**   
Fujimaru, you're not going on horseback?   
   
**Mash:**   
I do have Riding Skill, but...Senpai isn't very used to horses.   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, are you all right? You've been walking non-stop all this way, are you not tired?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This is nothing.   
   
**Mash:**   
Don't tell me...Before coming to Chaldea,you were the outdoors type?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you all right Mash?   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm fine. As a Demi-Servant I have incredible stamina.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You shouldn't try to keep up with Mash, Fujimaru. Demi-Servants have mind-blowing stamina.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You should've just gotten on that horse. Were you traumatized when you almost fell off?   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor. Try not to tease Senpai too much, please.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hahaha! Well, it's no fun just providing intel support.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&mdash;Hold! I am detecting life ahead. Not a Servant, but I think it's an enemy.   
   
**Nero:**   
Hmmm. The invisible mage is quite convenient.   
   
**Nero:**   
Faster than my scouts. If you may, please consider becoming my Court Mage.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Gulp. Royal service...A promotion?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Doctor.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, no, I was just kidding. How could I ever accept royal service?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyway, here they come! Flanking from left and right! Prepare for immediate combat!   
   
**Nero:**   
Umu, we'll get rid of them! Fujimaru, I'll leave the right side to you!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nero:**   
You handled those veterans like they were nobodies. With such small numbers, too.   
   
**Nero:**   
Was that thanks to Mash's skills? Or was it&ndash;  
   
**Nero:**   
Or was it Fujimaru's leadership? Either way, you're more intriguing than when we first met.   
   
**Nero:**   
Listen...Rather than a guest commander, want to serve me?   
   
**Nero:**   
You'll get to savor all the glory of this world by my side. I mean after we've defeated the United Empire, of course.   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Nero:**   
Well? Not a bad deal, is it?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
True...  
   
**Nero:**   
Isn't that right? Isn't that right? You're an honest soul. Heh, heh, I think I really like you now!   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, we have a mission. You haven't forgotten, have you?   
   
**Mash:**   
...You haven't forgotten, have you?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Please let me think about it.   
   
**Nero:**   
Can't answer right away even though you want to? How modest! Very well, think it over!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Once we defeat the United Empire, I can even grant you Britannia, let alone Gaul.   
   
**Nero:**   
You know of my generosity, but grand feasts like this have been rare.   
   
**Nero:**   
Isn't that right, soldier? Do I not excel in splendor among past emperors?   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
Yes, as you say. Today the brilliance that is Rome shines all the brighter!   
   
**Nero:**   
Heh, heh, an honest fellow. Yes, yes,I believe that even I may shine a bit too brightly.   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh? Mash is looking a little...  
   
**Mash:**   
What is it, Doctor?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, it's nothing. Nothing. Whoops! Another enemy attack! More regular soldiers, this time.   
   
**Nero:**   
This mage is really quite useful. Go on then, crush them once more!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Battle over. We've only sustained minor casualties.   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, good work! Aren't you exhausted?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Good work to you too.   
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right...Thank you very much,but I'm more worried about our allies.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm a little tired.   
   
**Mash:**   
You mustn't overdo it. Let's ask Nero if we can rest for a bit.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, we only have to endure this a little longer. We should be arriving soon. I can see it.   
   
**Nero:**   
...How truly convenient! I'm going to want one in every country, mage.   
   
**Nero:**   
Whoa, it's just like the mage said Fujimaru. We've entered the territory of Gaul. You must be tired from your long journey.   
   
**Nero:**   
The Gaul expedition troop's camp is nearby. We can finally get a good long rest.   
   
## Section 6: Wild Camp   
   
**Nero:**   
I am Emperor Nero Claudius! I shall allow you to listen carefully!   
   
**Nero:**   
Soldiers of the Gaul expedition, I thank you for your efforts for me, my subjects, and my Rome!   
   
**Nero:**   
I have now come to the expedition's aid. You now have a mighty general here with you!   
   
**Nero:**   
There's no reason for us to lose this battle! &ndash;Victory belongs to me, and the Rome you all love!   
   
**Mash:**   
Listen to the crowd. So this is how charismatic Emperor Nero was at her peak?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Probably, but it's also a mystery. She's so charismatic now, but in her later years...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...No, never mind. I will stop there, never tell people living in the past about the future. That's our policy.   
   
**Fou:**   
...Kyuu...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mm. This is...This reaction, Mash...right there&ndash;  
   
**G：???:**  
Well, Emperor Nero Claudius came earlier than I thought.   
   
**G：???:**  
&ndash;You there. [♂ The boy who looks like a rookie. /♀ The girl who's doing her best. ]Are you the guest commander I've heard so much about? I guess looks can be deceiving.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Thank you for travelling so far. I'm Boudica, general of the Gaul expedition.   
   
**Mash:**   
Boudica&ndash;?   
   
**Boudica:**   
Yes Boudica, the "former" queen of Britannia, and this huge fellow here is...  
   
**H：???:**  
Another champion who was invited to the battlefield. You should be pleased, this garden of battle is full of oppressors.   
   
**H：???:**  
The oppressors are committing atrocities as they approach. It is time to rise up. Let us battle side by side. You who dare defy this unparalleled tyranny.   
   
**Mash:**   
???  
   
**Mash:**   
...Right. His words baffle me, but I have a feeling...  
   
**Boudica:**   
H-Huh? Whoa, that's extremely rare. Spartacus hardly ever takes a liking to someone at first sight.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Let me correct myself. He hardly ever takes a liking to someone at first sight, without then pouncing on them.   
   
**Mash:**   
(...Doctor, this giant over here is. )  
   
**Fou:**   
(Fouuuuuu...)  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Y-Yes, he's definitely a muscle. )  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(I mean a Servant. That's what the reading says. Definitely a Servant. Let's leave it at that. )  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(He doesn't seem to have hostile intentions. )  
   
**Mash:**   
(I can't translate what he's saying. He's looking at us, but what does he mean by "You who defy tyranny"&ndash;? )  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(My guess is he's a Berserker. Yes, he must be...Maybe...)  
   
**Spartacus:**   
Warrior of the rebellion, give me your name. Let us revolt together against the inhumane empire and shout in triumph under a free sky.   
   
**Mash:**   
???  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
My name is Fujimaru.   
   
**Mash:**   
Did he ask for your name just now? Is that what it was?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't know what he's saying.   
   
**Mash:**   
Neither do I...He's got this extremely carefree smile, but that's all I'm getting...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? He's smiling while saying all that? His Madness Enhancement must be incredible.    
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That being said, I suppose this proves that even in this era, stray Servants do exist.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
For some reason, unlike hostile Servants, there are also those who have free will, stand by their era, and fight.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It has been confirmed in two eras. I am sure it will be the case for all the singularities.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If we count Fuyuki, this makes the third time&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
At any rate, this is encouraging. This way we know we'll have allies even without summoning.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Ummmm, are you the Invisible Mage?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh excuse me, let me introduce myself. I am Roman, and...  
   
**Mash:**   
I am Mash Kyrielight,this is Fujimaru...The viceroy.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I've heard your names before, news of you travels even out here. They are the honored guests, aren't they, Your Majesty.    
   
**Nero:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
Your Majesty?   
   
**Nero:**   
...Mm. D-Did you say something? It seems I am a little tired. Boudica, take care of our guests.   
   
**Nero:**   
Tell them about the situation here in Gaul. I have a terrible headache. I'm going to lie down for a bit.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Understood. Leave these youngsters to me.   
   
**Nero:**   
Yes, I'm counting on you. Fujimaru,you must be exhausted, too. You should get some rest.   
   
**Boudica:**   
...  
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
I bring news! An enemy scouting party has been discovered!   
   
**Boudica:**   
...Can we pursue them?   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
We can't catch up to the enemy soldiers' speed! At this rate, it's possible they'll get away!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, you're right. A group of them are leaving the camp and making off with intel on us!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I think we should strike,Mash and Fujimaru.   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood, Doctor.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sometime we can't let them go.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right. Let's go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;So that's the story. I think we'll be in your care for a while.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Oh? From a foreign world? I see, I guess such things can really happen.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Thank you for your understanding. Boudica, was it? You're a Servant too, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Doctor.   
   
**Boudica:**   
It's all right, you don't have to hold your tongue. Yes, I "should be dead" already.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I see you find that strange. How did Queen Boudica become a Roman general, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. In the history that I'm aware of, you&ndash;  
   
**Boudica:**   
Yes, that's right.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I'll never forgive Emperor Nero or Rome. I even swore it to the Celtic gods.   
   
**Boudica:**   
...And then I materialized. To this era right after my death, of all things.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I thought maybe it was my chance for revenge,but when I saw Rome overrun by the United Empire...  
   
**Boudica:**   
My body moved on its own. Not for Nero's sake, but for the people who live there.   
   
**Boudica:**   
...Or did I feel guilty towards the Londinium fellows, whom I brutally murdered for the sake of my vengeance.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I don't really know myself. But when I think about it, I've always been like that.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I think fighting to protect something is just my personality. That's what seems most natural to me.   
   
**Boudica:**   
So my apologies to Nero, who wrongly sees me as a "worthy living opponent," but...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you keeping your Servant status a secret?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you keeping your death a secret?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Yes, because somehow she's more dangerous than before. If she becomes overly concerned about me, who knows what she would do.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Understood. You're a proper Heroic Spirit.   
   
**Mash:**   
A hero whom others aspire to be. The symbol of strength used to suppress villainy and save others.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Nyahaha, I was just doing it on a whim...Although if that's how I look to you, who am I to disagree?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There aren't many Heroic Spirits who could put it like that. Queen Boudica, your pride is dazzling.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai. Um, are you keeping up with the conversation?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't really get it...  
   
**Mash:**   
I didn't think so. Sorry, I'll explain.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yes, it's okay. I understand.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Right. Ms. Boudica is, um...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...She's a Heroic Spirit, a Servant. She was killed by Nero's army just before this era.   
   
**Mash:**   
She was the Queen of Britannia, which was overrun by Rome. Now she stands with Nero.   
   
**Mash:**   
I do have a question, though. I mean, why&ndash;  
   
**Boudica:**   
It's not that difficult. I dislike the United Empire more than Nero.   
   
**Boudica:**   
You feel the same way, don't you Spartacus? You intend to fight a legion of oppressors.   
   
**Boudica:**   
It's dangerous to say this, but she isn't the enemy. You don't consider yourself to be Nero's ally, do you?   
   
**Spartacus:**   
Hahaha, the walls of the colosseum have fallen. Soon, all of this land shall become my colosseum.   
   
**Boudica:**   
You see?   
   
**Mash:**   
(I don't. )  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(I wonder if she possesses a special skill. Like Madness Comprehension...or something? )  
   
**Mash:**   
A-Anyway. Both of them are Heroic Spirits and Servants.   
   
**Mash:**   
Just like in Orleans, right? In a singularity, multiple Servants will materialize.   
   
**Mash:**   
But not all of them are enemies. Some have wills of their own and stand on the side of justice.   
   
**Boudica:**   
You're embarrassing me. I'm not all that.   
   
**Spartacus:**   
Hahaha! Behold, this muscular body is proof of the uprising. The oppressors shall know any injuries inflicted are my strength.   
   
**Boudica:**   
There, you see? Spartacus is embarrassed, too.   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai, did you understand what he said?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I got the gist.   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? R-Really?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Not one bit!   
   
**Mash:**   
I-I didn't think so. I didn't catch any of it either...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
&ndash;All right, shall we get started then?   
   
**Mash:**   
Excuse me?   
   
**Boudica:**   
I don't doubt your skills, but...Ah, actually, maybe I do.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Right now, the United Empire controls most of Gaul. Not even we can drive them out.   
   
**Boudica:**   
The ruler of Gaul&ndash;One of the "emperors," is strong.   
   
**Boudica:**   
There's nothing excessive about him, body or mind. He's a top-notch hero in both looks and skills.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Do you have the strength to fight him head-on? Or should I use you as back-up?   
   
**Boudica:**   
My apologies, but could I put your abilities to the test?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What? I thought you were a rational queen, but it turns out you're a hero who "speaks" with her sword!   
   
**Boudica:**   
Ahaha, now you've got the idea. So, shall we?   
   
**Boudica:**   
Just try not to die. When we're done,I'll whip up something delicious for you.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Of course I mean Britannia cuisine, not Roman. &ndash;So, let's meet face to face and cross swords!   
   
**Boudica:**   
My True Name is Boudica, class Rider! Be careful, because my chariot is extremely strong!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Boudica:**   
Ah.... I must say, I am happy to be proven wrong about you.   
   
**Boudica:**   
You showed me how competent you are. Thanks,I know you must be exhausted from your travels.   
   
**Boudica:**   
My defense and Spartacus's offense matches pretty well. You held your own against us, I underestimated you!   
   
**Boudica:**   
As for you...Mash? You're a shield-wielding Heroic Spirit, right? I really like you.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I know it's twisted to have a weapon solely for defense, but it's far better than one solely for killing.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I mean, how can you be so reliable when you're so slim?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?   
   
**Mash:**   
R-Reliable?   
   
**Boudica:**   
Yes, when you wielded your shield and stood your ground...It was like you'd taken root.   
   
**Boudica:**   
If Lord Nero is the violence of fire, then you're the riches of the earth. I think you'd be compatible with any Heroic Spirit.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Right.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Yes, good answer. Indeed, indeed.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Hmm...  
   
**Boudica:**   
Hmm, hmm. (staring)  
   
**Boudica:**   
Hmm, hmm, hmm. (staring)  
   
**Mash:**   
E-Excuse me?   
   
**Boudica:**   
Now that I look at you carefully, yes, I see. So that's what it is. If that's the case, you should have just told me!   
   
**Mash:**   
Excuse me?   
   
**Boudica:**   
Things are getting complicated, aren't they? Even we...Ah, I just noticed. How adorable!   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?   
   
**Boudica:**   
Come here. Come on. There, there.   
   
**Mash:**   
Ah&ndash;W-What is it, Boudica? Augh...What's with you all of a sudden...  
   
**Boudica:**   
You're like a little sister to me. Maybe both of you are. There, there.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I'm so proud of you, coming from a faraway time period. You're so strong. There, there.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's like an aunt...or big sister.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Boudica's chest is mashing Mash...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
U-Um, y-your chest...I can't breathe...  
   
**Boudica:**   
Mmm, good girl, good girl!   
   
**Boudica:**   
You called yourself Nero's ally so I was on my guard for a bit, sorry!   
   
**Boudica:**   
But now I'm in a great mood! All right, tonight I'll make you something wonderful to eat!   
   
**Boudica:**   
Your big sister here is really good at cooking Britannia cuisine. You'll eat it, won't you?   
   
**Mash:**   
T-Thank you...Senpai, how about you? Are you hungry?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Famished.   
   
**Mash:**   
I know, right? Actually, me too.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm just completely exhausted.   
   
**Mash:**   
Ah...I-I know, right? I'm exhausted from traveling, too. I'm sorry!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Boudica:**   
Yes, yes! Eat, eat, and then go to sleep! That's the key to having plenty of energy!   
   
**Boudica:**   
Even if you don't like it, I'll force you to eat! Then after dinner&ndash;  
   
**Boudica:**   
Of course, we should take a bath! I'll even wash your back.   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?   
   
**Boudica:**   
I hate to admit this, but Roman baths are the best in the world. It goes to show that even Nero can be useful.   
   
**Boudica:**   
It feels amazing. Even Spartacus calms down when he's immersed in hot water.   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?   
   
**Mash:**   
U-Um...I think you can let go of me now...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Berserkers calm down when they're immersed in hot water...This is a discovery Mash!   
   
**Mash:**   
No, it's not.   
   
**Mash:**   
No...  
   
## Section 7: Take Back Gaul!   
   
**United Empire Soldier:**   
I have a report, Your Majesty. Enemy attacks are intensifying&ndash;and we have a message from the front.   
   
**United Empire Soldier:**   
A small unit led by the pretender, Emperor Nero, is advancing with incredible force.   
   
**United Empire Soldier:**   
It's as you said, Your Majesty. There's a "special" enemy leader among them.   
   
**Caesar:**   
I see.   
   
**United Empire Soldier:**   
Yes, sir.   
   
**Caesar:**   
Hmm.   
   
**United Empire Soldier:**   
Sir, how should we proceed?   
   
**Caesar:**   
Do nothing. Forget about them.   
   
**United Empire Soldier:**   
What?   
   
**Caesar:**   
Only a Servant can stand up to another Servant. Seriously, it's such a pain.   
   
**Caesar:**   
It's laughable to think that the fickle gods would come this far. I mean, look at me&ndash;  
   
**Caesar:**   
A "Saber" class, huh? To think they would make me take up my sword.   
   
**United Empire Soldier:**   
D-Do you mean...Emperor Caesar, are you going into battle yourself?   
   
**Caesar:**   
Fool.   
   
**United Empire Soldier:**   
Sir!   
   
**Caesar:**   
I am not going into battle. They are coming to me.   
   
**Caesar:**   
I'm not moving. The rest of you better not meddle with them, either.   
   
**United Empire Soldier:**   
B-But, Your Majesty! We are soldiers of the true United Roman Empire!   
   
**United Empire Soldier:**   
If our rule over Gaul is the will of the gods, then we must not retreat!   
   
**Caesar:**   
Fool! Are you in a hurry to die? Humans cannot defeat a Servant. They would be slaughtered.   
   
**United Empire Soldier:**   
B-But...  
   
**Caesar:**   
Then let it be an order. Fight in moderation, I do not desire your deaths.   
   
**United Empire Soldier:**   
...Yes, sir! With everything I have.   
   
**Caesar:**   
That being said, I'm sure you are going to die for the sake of the Rome that you believe in.   
   
**Caesar:**   
Honestly...I've had it with "that one's" whims.   
   
**Caesar:**   
Perfect government. Perfect leadership. But then you're left with a colony of people without a will.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Spartacus and I will lead the charge! Both of you,go with Nero to take the enemy's main camp.   
   
**Spartacus:**   
Hahahahaha. Wonderful. Everything is here. Hundreds, thousands of oppressor's evil agents are here.   
   
**Spartacus:**   
Now is the time to sing of our victory. We're not at a disadvantage, we have the upper hand. From now on, my warcry shall signify the beginning of our triumph.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Not over there, here! Oh, come on Spartacus!   
   
**Spartacus:**   
Hahahahaha. The queen of the rebellion is my ally. That is to say, victory is at hand. The powerful will be defeated!   
   
**Nero:**   
...Umu, I'm counting on you, Boudica. In a number of ways, I'm counting on you.   
   
**Nero:**   
Still, Spartacus isn't wrong! The time has come to defeat one of the "emperors. "  
   
**Nero:**   
Let us take Gaul back from the false emperor! Come, Mash and Fujimaru!   
   
**Mash:**   
Right. Master!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hold nothing back!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's be careful out there!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right! Order understood!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...What was that enemy just now.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No question, it's a magical creature. Is this the work of an enemy Servant or mage?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Or was it Lev Lainur&ndash;?   
   
**Nero:**   
Stop daydreaming! We're charging into the enemy's main camp!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I am getting a reading on non-human, non-Servant entity. Fujimaru, more golems are coming!   
   
**Mash:**   
I will crush them. Master, your orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Caesar:**   
...So you're here.   
   
**Caesar:**   
I'm tired of waiting. How long do you intend to keep me waiting.    
   
**Caesar:**   
Still though, it looks like it was worth a little boredom!   
   
**Caesar:**   
That beauty of yours&ndash;  
   
**Caesar:**   
So beautiful. Beautiful. Truly beautiful, your beauty is fitting for the world's greatest treasure - Rome!   
   
**Caesar:**   
Heir to our beloved Rome. What did you say your name was?   
   
**Nero:**   
&mdash;  
   
**Caesar:**   
Don't fall silent. Even if it's on the battlefield, be eloquent.   
   
**Caesar:**   
Or do you intend to fight without giving me your name? Is that the way of the current Roman emperor?   
   
**Caesar:**   
Now then, speak. Who is the one who would force me to take up arms, what is your name?   
   
**Nero:**   
&ndash;Nero. I am the fifth Emperor of the Roman Empire.   
   
**Nero:**   
My name is Nero Claudius. I will take you out pretender to the throne!   
   
**Caesar:**   
I like how you announced yourself. Otherwise it would all be so dull.   
   
**Caesar:**   
You, guest commander! Thank you for coming from a distant land. Tell me your names as well.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I am Fujimaru.   
   
**Mash:**   
Mash Kyrielight. I'm Master Fujimaru's Servant.   
   
**Caesar:**   
I've never heard of those names. All roads lead to Rome, eh? I see that I was arrogant.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Um, you're kind of plump, aren't you?   
   
**Caesar:**   
Of course, Rome is the pinnacle of civilization and that begins with gourmet food. Plumpness is power.   
   
**Caesar:**   
Take the fifth Emperor here, she's plump in all the right places. Although inferior to my woman, the Queen of Desert, but that's fine.   
   
**Nero:**   
...Mmm, as befits the mystery man who subdued Gaul...You soften a woman's heart as naturally as you breathe...  
   
**Nero:**   
But I am not a woman like my mother. I am an emperor and a young maiden!   
   
**Nero:**   
Oddly rotund man, your words fail to strike a chord in my heart!   
   
**Caesar:**   
Is that so...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Um, can we get down to business?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I want to ask you something. About the United Empire, and the Holy Grail.   
   
**Caesar:**   
Oh? Then, um, the what's-your-name over there...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's Fujimaru.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Caesar:**   
So you're the "Master," huh? I see, so this is Master and Servant.   
   
**Caesar:**   
You seem very different from the one I know. Or are you the proper one?   
   
**Caesar:**   
In any case, I suppose you're my enemy. It's a pain, but so be it.   
   
**Caesar:**   
Let me reward you for coming all this way. I will let you witness the power of my golden sword, Crocea Mors.   
   
**Nero:**   
Don't say that! Gold is my color! Mine! The one who built the Golden Theater!   
   
**Caesar:**   
Haha, that's the spirit. Protect her well, Demi-Servant.   
   
**Caesar:**   
Fight well and perhaps I will tell you where to find the Holy Grail that you seek.   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Caesar:**   
Now then&ndash;Come forth. The die has already been cast.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Caesar:**   
Hmm, you certainly are strong. No&ndash;  
   
**Caesar:**   
Who would even place a fine general like me on the front lines in the first place. Can't call this "best man for the job. "  
   
**Mash:**   
Wielding such a devastating sword...How can you even say that...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Just what you'd expect of a Saber Class...He's truly a skilled Servant.   
   
**Nero:**   
Such a monster...Ugh, and I thought he was just a fake emperor...  
   
**Caesar:**   
No, you're wrong about that Nero Claudius. I'm still the emperor, though no such title existed in my time.   
   
**Caesar:**   
In response to your beauty and courage, I shall tell you my name. I am Caesar. In other words...  
   
**Caesar:**   
Gaius Julius Caesar.   
   
**Nero:**   
Wh-What? That's...the name of the ruler who preceded our first emperor...  
   
**Nero:**   
But...You're dead...How can this be?   
   
**Caesar:**   
You've already met Caligula, I presume? Then you should already know.   
   
**Caesar:**   
We're "genuine. "Both myself...and him.   
   
**Nero:**   
...Ugh.   
   
**Caesar:**   
Try to relax. You are beautiful, truly beautiful. Your beauty can match any other treasure in the world.   
   
**Caesar:**   
You, Demi-Servant, you too are beautiful. Very nice indeed. Nice body, too.   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Caesar:**   
I admire your courage, strength, and beauty. Therefore, I shall tell you one thing.   
   
**Caesar:**   
The Holy Grail is located in a castle within the United Empire's capital. More precisely, in the hands of our Court Mage.   
   
**Mash:**   
Mage&ndash;Can you tell us the name of that person?   
   
**Caesar:**   
I can't. Your reward ends here for I have no reason to tell you more.   
   
**Caesar:**   
Now, Emperor Nero, your hardship is not something I wish for.   
   
**Caesar:**   
But I have my own reasons to fight. I want that Holy Grail for myself as well.   
   
**Caesar:**   
They say once a Servant has obtained the Holy Grail, they can get any wish granted&ndash;  
   
**Caesar:**   
This is rather greedy as I am already dead, but I must fulfill the promise that I made.   
   
**Caesar:**   
...Well then. It's time for me to be serious.   
   
**Caesar:**   
It's been a while, so I needed exercise. The poor golden sword also needs occasional use.   
   
**Nero:**   
"Serious? "  
   
**Mash:**   
This presence&ndash;Please be careful, Master!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
His magical energy level is rising? No, he's unleashing what he's been holding back!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I guess our opponent has gotten serious! Or rather, he didn't fight seriously until now!   
   
**Caesar:**   
I came, I saw. Now, I must conquer!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nero:**   
Mm, mmm...Did we...get him?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, I can detect his readings are getting weaker. You've won. Congratulations.   
   
**Mash:**   
Your sword was very powerful, but as long as I have Senpai's instructions I can block it.   
   
**Caesar:**   
Hmm, being taken out by beautiful women isn't so bad.   
   
**Caesar:**   
It's not feasible for me to act like a mere soldier anyway. Seriously, I was helpless against that person's weirdness.   
   
**Nero:**   
That person&ndash;?   
   
**Caesar:**   
That's right, the true emperor of this era. That person is surely waiting for your arrival in the capital.   
   
**Caesar:**   
I'm not an emperor to be exact, but none of the past "emperors" can stand up against that person.   
   
**Caesar:**   
When you see that person's name and face,I wonder how you'll react? I can't wait.   
   
**Caesar:**   
I am not being sarcastic. You are beautiful,no matter what expression you may have&ndash;  
   
**Nero:**   
He's gone...  
   
**Nero:**   
What's this...Is this some sort of magecraft...or...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's a Servant death.   
   
**Nero:**   
What did you...  
   
**Mash:**   
Like Senpai said, that Servant has lost his life.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's left this world.   
   
**Nero:**   
What did you...  
   
**Mash:**   
Like Senpai said, that Servant is gone from this world.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
A Servant disappears when facing death. Their temporary body dissipates, and their experience is sent back to the Throne.   
   
**Nero:**   
I don't quite understand...What that bastard, no, "that man" said earlier.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He is a Servant. A deceased human transcended into a different form.   
   
**Nero:**   
...I see.   
   
**Nero:**   
I made you personally kill the once great ruler Caesar.   
   
**Mash:**   
Nero&ndash;  
   
**Nero:**   
No, nothing. Umu! I commend you for defeating one of the "emperors. "  
   
**Nero:**   
Now Gaul is truly under my command. We have shown the United Empire what we can do!   
   
**Nero:**   
Just as I wished, just as my people wished, the Rome blessed by our ancestors and gods is returning to us!   
   
**Nero:**   
I will bring Rome back into my hands! Until then&ndash;Until then, no matter what, I cannot afford to stop here.   
   
**E：???:**  
...So Caesar was defeated.   
   
**Lev:**   
Yes, it seems that way. I only used him because he had a wish for the Grail.   
   
**Lev:**   
This shouldn't cause many issues. I can summon as many new Servants as I want.   
   
**Lev:**   
If there's an issue, it's this foolish Berserker. Isn't it obvious that Berserkers are fools?   
   
**Lev:**   
I was surprised he would defy my orders. Is blood thicker than water? What a joke.   
   
**Caligula:**   
For my destiny...My beloved niece Nero...is irrelevant...  
   
**Caligula:**   
Beautiful child...Nero, you will be loved, loved, so loved...  
   
**Caligula:**   
Therefore...In my destiny...  
   
**Lev:**   
Hmph, I regret not having a Command Spell. However, I have quite the spell ready for you.   
   
**Lev:**   
You will kill your niece with your own hands. Then,drowned in regret, you will destroy everything else in this era.   
   
**Lev:**   
That said&mdash;You likely don't have enough intellect left to regret.   
   
**Lev:**   
My, my, Servants truly are inconvenient beings.   
   
**Lev:**   
No matter how legendary you are, or how much superhuman strength you possess, in the end you are just mere familiars.   
   
**Lev:**   
With the power to change the world at will, yet that freedom is not allowed. Talk about irony.   
   
**Lev:**   
Say, wouldn't you agree?   
   
**E：???:**  
...Well then.   
   
**Lev:**   
Oh, excuse me. Come to think it, you are a Servant too.   
   
**Lev:**   
&mdash;Heh, that's why you must obey me. If anything called destiny exists for you, I am it.   
   
**Lev:**   
The utter annihilation of this era. The death of Emperor Nero, the collapse of ancient Rome, the death of humanity.    
   
**Lev:**   
That&ndash;is my duty, bestowed upon me by our king.   
   
**E：???:**  
...Yes.   
   
**Lev:**   
Then, it is time to replenish our lost personnel. The summoning ritual is almost finished.   
   
**Lev:**   
This is different than the incomplete one in Chaldea. I can truly summon Servants at will.   
   
**Lev:**   
We were created as such. With this summoning ritual,I stand at the end of this world.   
   
**Leonidas:**   
...Servant, Lancer. True Name, Leonidas. I will serve you from here on.   
   
**Lev:**   
Oh, a Heroic Spirit from Thermopylae. Not bad. Use your full powers to eliminate Nero Claudius&ndash;  
   
## Section 8: The Trip Back Home   
   
**Nero:**   
...Hmm.   
   
**Nero:**   
Did you hear what that farmer said just now? The traveler we passed yesterday said the same thing.   
   
**Nero:**   
That "an ancient god has appeared. "Could it be true?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I wonder. It's an interesting phrase. If he said"ancient god," could it be from the Age of the Gods.   
   
**Mash:**   
To be precise, it's the fourth time we've heard it. None of them seemed to be lying.   
   
**Mash:**   
"An ancient god appeared on an island in the Mediterranean. " For a rumor, it's very specific.   
   
**Nero:**   
Well, Gaul faces the Mediterranean. It's not unusual to hear such rumors...  
   
**Nero:**   
But after hearing it over and over, I'm intrigued. Though we're on our way back to Rome now.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm, it is intriguing, huh? I mean, I'm extremely intrigued.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru, what do you think?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It may have to do with the Holy Grail.   
   
**Mash:**   
Well...I don't know about that. Caesar said their Court Mage has possession of it.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We can't tell if it's Lev Lainur or not,but is it possible that he moved to the Mediterranean?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And is claiming to be a god. It's a likely story.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, well, he could be a real god.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think we might've misheard.   
   
**Mash:**   
No, we've heard it multiple times for sure. Senpai, have you forgotten?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
An island where a god lives, huh. Ah, that sounds so romantic!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
An ancient god in the 1st Century! The supposedly gone Divine Spirits returned to the land once more!   
   
**Mash:**   
Question Doctor, is materialization of Divine Spirits really possible?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's difficult. So much so that it's nigh impossible. At least, it's not possible with Chaldea's system.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Divine Spirit?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, a Divine Spirit.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Divine Spirit, not Heroic Spirit?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. It is different than a Heroic Spirit. It is said to be a higher being than elementals.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Divine beings are mentioned in many legends of this world. Sometimes as a natural phenomenon, or symbols of authority.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They are what you may call God, or gods. Just think of Divine Spirits as a term to define them.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They're already gone from the face of the Earth. Perhaps they never existed in the first place?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's hard to understand with magecraft developed after Anno Domini. After all, we can't observe them in our time.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
When you pray to the gods in times of trouble, they don't give help that easily do they?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Maybe that was a bad example. In any case, they "do not exist. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
However, several pieces of supporting evidence exist. Hence we predict Divine Spirits exist in a higher dimension.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
At the very least, they won't do anything directly. No, they can't do anything.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyways, it's impossible. The world has long been that of humans and civilization.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even if there was a kind god, realistically they wouldn't be able to regain a lost future.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We're the only ones who can possibly save the world and its future.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So, let's get back to an earlier topic. Whether or not a Divine Spirit can materialize as a Servant.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They can't. That's the answer.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even if "they" were inclined to do so. Even if technology reached realms of True Magic, it's disadvantageous.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In theory, it should not necessarily be impossible though.   
   
**Mash:**   
Then, the god of the Mediterranean&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's probably not a god from somewhere. Probability of a materialized Divine Spirit is quite low.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But, there might be that one in a million chance if it's a god that fell from its throne.   
   
**Nero:**   
This is pointless. Umu, if it's on our minds so much, fine!   
   
**Nero:**   
It would be a good idea to verify. Fortunately, we're facing the Mediterranean Sea.   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
Your Majesty! Rear ranks are being assaulted by an unknown monster!   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
We can't hold it down! At this rate...  
   
**Nero:**   
...Mm, perfect timing.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I am detecting traces of magical energy. It could be the Holy Grail that's causing the monster to spawn.   
   
**Mash:**   
Let's go, Senpai!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's quickly deal with it.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Be careful, but be quick.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master. Commencing battle!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;The battle has ended. There are no reinforcements.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ahh, how awful. To think that spirits of the dead would materialize on their own.   
   
**Nero:**   
I'm used to it. So, uh, what were we talking about&ndash;  
   
**Nero:**   
Right, that Mediterranean god! Personally, I'd really like to find out about that.   
   
**Mash:**   
Are you sure? Don't you need to return to Rome?   
   
**Nero:**   
I don't know what this ancient god may be, but what if it's truly one of the gods?   
   
**Nero:**   
It's not impossible, right? There are Roman legends.   
   
**Nero:**   
For instance, Romulus the founder and first king of Rome became the newest god after he disappeared in lightning.   
   
**Nero:**   
Things like that occasionally happen. Ancient gods. How amusing.   
   
**Nero:**   
Further, assume they are gods of Rome. If the United Empire's "emperors" took that god away, we'd have bigger problems.   
   
**Nero:**   
I don't want that. That's the one thing I absolutely cannot stand.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see, Your Majesty's words are reasonable. As guest commanders, we'd be happy to accompany you.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Aren't you enjoying this too much, Doctor?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's not true! I just can't hide my overflowing curiosity as a researcher!   
   
**Mash:**   
But that's...  
   
**Fou:**   
Fu...Kyu, kyu. Fou.   
   
**Nero:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
Come on Nero, say something...  
   
**Mash:**   
Nero? Are you all right?   
   
**Nero:**   
...Hmm, what? No, I've decided. A triumphant return from the sea might not be so bad!   
   
**Nero:**   
Then, we'll continue our journey back through the sea. I'm rather tired of traveling on land!   
   
**Mash:**   
(She spaced out just now. )  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Right. This must be what Boudica was talking about. )  
   
**Boudica:**   
There's something I'm worried about. Something about Nero.   
   
**Boudica:**   
It happened right after you got here. I wonder if you noticed.   
   
**Boudica:**   
She occasionally spaces out. She been like that ever since the United Empire showed up.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I think it might be just me, but when it happens,I feel a slight trace of magical energy.   
   
**Boudica:**   
...She's a human from this era, not a mage. Still, I definitely feel it.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I asked her about it, but she doesn't feel it at all.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Can you guys keep an eye out? I mean, about her.   
   
**Boudica:**   
As the governors of Gaul, Spartacus and I must to continue protecting this place.   
   
**Boudica:**   
About her...If possible, I'd like to rely on you all.   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. You are...worried about Nero aren't you.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I wouldn't worry about her at all! ...It's not something I want to do personally.   
   
**Boudica:**   
For better or for worse, she's the symbol of this land. If something happens to her, it would be a war lost.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I don't want to lose another war. That's the only reason I care about her.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Right.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Well then, that's that. Mash, we still have time, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
U-Um&ndash;  
   
**Boudica:**   
Before you leave, I will teach you the best of Britannia cuisine!   
   
**Boudica:**   
I'd be happy if you learned it and made it your specialty!   
   
**Mash:**   
N-No, that's&ndash;  
   
**Boudica:**   
You're so cute, you should start training to be a bride!   
   
**Boudica:**   
Oh, geez, so cute! Come here!   
   
**Mash:**   
W-Wah! Again&ndash;Your breasts&ndash;  
   
**Boudica:**   
There, there. Good girl, good girl.   
   
**Boudica:**   
You stay cheerful forever. Don't get too hurt, and don't be too reckless.   
   
**Boudica:**   
You really are an adorable girl.   
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes, well, I-I am Senpai's...Um...  
   
**Boudica:**   
There, there! I am so happy to see you grow into such a fine lady!   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Yeah, I definitely sensed a trace of magical energy in Nero. But that might just mean she has the potential to be a mage. )  
   
**Mash:**   
(I wonder what it is. )  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
(Hmm, we don't have enough info...)  
   
**Nero:**   
All right, then it's settled! Let's go, we must first hurry and procure a ship!   
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;Before that, Master look, the enemy army remnant. I feel their presence.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, I have detected multiple lifeforms. I am getting hostile readings from the United Empire troops in Gaul.   
   
**Nero:**   
I'd leave them be if they're fleeing home, but if they're headed here it can't be helped. Let's defeat them!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nero:**   
It's more or less taken care of. Now then, let's regroup and head out to the sea.   
   
**Nero:**   
It's good to travel by sea. Fujimaru,let me show you my brilliant sailing skills!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I can't wait!   
   
**Nero:**   
Right? Right? Heh, heh, such a honest fellow.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm a bit worried.   
   
**Nero:**   
No need to be embarrassed. Heh, heh, you're bad at hiding your feelings, huh?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The emperor is amazing! Whatever you say, she interprets it in a positive way!   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
## Section 9: Secret of the Ancient God   
   
**Nero:**   
Umu, that was some nice wind! It was the most aggressive voyage ever!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Thank goodness my semicircular canals were enhanced.   
   
**Mash:**   
If I hadn't become a Demi-Servant...Ugh...I'm not going to go there.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Y-You seem to have gone through an ordeal. I could tell by your vitals.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The soldiers couldn't leave the ship either. Oh, poor men!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Since the emperor offered to take the wheel herself, I thought she had impeccable skills.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But wait, maybe, just maybe! Those were impeccable skills, in a sense.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I mean, the ship's still standing after such a rocky journey. It also leapt through waves, and drifted some turns...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's amazing when you think about it. Just what you'd expect of the emperor...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't be stupid.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I agree.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hahaha! Oh c'mon Fujimaru,you didn't get mad, did you?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyways, you landed safely on the rumored island. You should start looking for this ancient god&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, maybe we don't have to look after all? It seems the god is coming to greet us.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
However, I am detecting a Servant. Be on your guard.   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Nero:**   
What, another enemy attack? So this island is also under the United Empire's control.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, this is...a Servant, but...Something is off. It's different than normal, what is this?   
   
**E：???:**  
Yes, that's right. I'm not a "normal" Servant.   
   
**E：???:**  
Good day heroes, welcome to my humble temporary home for this era, the "Shaped" Isle.   
   
**E：???:**  
My, oh my. I was wondering what kind of magnificent hero was here.   
   
**E：???:**  
But to my surprise, it seems there are Servants in your group. Unfortunately, I was waiting for human heroes.   
   
**Mash:**   
This presence&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What in the world...can this even be possible? Her reading is definitely like a Servant, but different...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What the...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is she the "ancient god"?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
An immeasurable divinity level! Without a doubt, she's definitely a god. No, a goddess!   
   
**Stheno:**   
That's right. I am a goddess&ndash;my name is Stheno.   
   
**Stheno:**   
One of the three Gorgon Sisters. Though, I rather dislike being called an ancient god.   
   
**Stheno:**   
But it's fine. It is true that where you're from, I am a past god.   
   
**Stheno:**   
You may call me whatever you wish. After all, time is irrelevant when it comes to my beauty.   
   
**Mash:**   
Servant of a Divine Spirit, not a Heroic Spirit? Doctor, this is different from what we talked about.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Y-Yeah, I guess everything has an exception. O-Oh this is unheard of, a Divine Spirit Servant.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Furthermore, one of "the" ancient Greek gods! That's an authentic god!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Is that possible? She is actually standing before you. Even so, there's no way she can remain "as a god. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I mean, it's the same for Heroic Spirits. Her power must've been downsized.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Gods no longer have "Authority" on this land. If that's the case...  
   
**Stheno:**   
Aren't you the knowledgeable one, Mage. That's right, you are not mistaken there.   
   
**Stheno:**   
However...There's one thing you should remember, pure one.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
W-What is it? &ndash;To think a goddess would personally instruct me.   
   
**Stheno:**   
Oh, what a wonderful voice. It has a nice sound to it,I would love to see your face but...  
   
**Stheno:**   
Such a shame. You're in a place where even my "eyes" can't reach.   
   
**Stheno:**   
If you were in my arm's reach, I'd have done something nice to you in the wink of an eye.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Whoa...I just had shivers down my entire body...This presence is different than Dark Jeanne!   
   
**Stheno:**   
Oh, that's just your imagination. Allow me to inform all of you clueless people.   
   
**Stheno:**   
Not all gods are powerful. "Myself" and I are quite "feeble" beings.   
   
**Mash:**   
???  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Based on the readings you are quite an individual...So does that mean you're not hostile because your combat abilities are low?   
   
**Stheno:**   
There are goddesses who are never asked to fight. For instance, you over there.   
   
**Mash:**   
You mean me?   
   
**Stheno:**   
You are one such, no? Your power is not to kill, but to protect.   
   
**Mash:**   
...It is.   
   
**Stheno:**   
Hehe, I do like honest girls. I'd like to pamper you like I do to my "little sister. "  
   
**Mash:**   
(Oh, I just got a shiver. )  
   
**Nero:**   
(I had a shiver, too! )  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Wait. I'm detecting another presence on the beach!   
   
**Stheno:**   
Oh my.   
   
**Nero:**   
How dare they interrupt an emperor and a goddess. Who are they? From the United Empire?   
   
**Mash:**   
...No, they're just ghosts. But they are closing in.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's drive them off.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's ask them to leave.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes Senpai, commencing interceptive combat!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nero:**   
Anyway! Stop leaving me out of the conversation!   
   
**Nero:**   
I get the gist of what you're saying. That goddess isn't our enemy, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
Right. I'm assuming that's the case.   
   
**Nero:**   
Hmm, in that case, isn't it simple? Ancient Goddess Stheno, come to Rome!   
   
**Nero:**   
I am Rome. The fifth emperor of the Roman Empire, Nero Claudius.   
   
**Nero:**   
I shall accept you as a new god. Let us defeat the United Empire together!   
   
**Stheno:**   
Well now, how dazzling you are,as much as Apollo. But I'm sorry, Your Majesty.   
   
**Stheno:**   
I am not suitable for combat.   
   
**Stheno:**   
Now that I've taken on the form of a Servant, I do have some skills and basic functions, but...  
   
**Stheno:**   
I don't possess the power to fight valiantly like my younger sister.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What?   
   
**Stheno:**   
I said I don't have the power♡ You'll get stabbed in the back if you don't stop being insensitive.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Sorry, I get it. She's more of the type of goddess who hunts her prey, I guess.   
   
**Stheno:**   
But, you are a hero who came all the way here.   
   
**Stheno:**   
I should give you a reward. Though back in the day, I would've incited Medusa&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Incited?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I heard nothing  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Incited?   
   
**Mash:**   
Did you say incited?   
   
**Stheno:**   
Ahem, hehe. Never mind! I'll give you a goddess' blessing.   
   
**Stheno:**   
As you walk along the coast, you'll find an entrance to a cave. All the way in the back...  
   
**Stheno:**   
I prepared a treasure. It doesn't exist in nature, it's something special.   
   
**Stheno:**   
I'll give it to you because you're fun. Haha, I don't usually reward someone like this.   
   
**Nero:**   
Well, a goddess' blessing...That's really...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's interesting. It could be the Holy Grail.   
   
**Mash:**   
It doesn't match up with Caesar's information. That said, I think there's still a chance...  
   
**Nero:**   
I don't care what kind of treasure it is. I try to love everything.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All right then, let's head for the cave now!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Nero:**   
Ugh...  
   
**Nero:**   
...It's so dark, and clammy...  
   
**Mash:**   
It's not exactly comfortable in here, is it? It's hard to see ahead.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh...  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, is something wrong? Your face...no, I mean your voice sounds funny.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I've been deceived. Forgive me,multiple magical energy signatures up ahead.   
   
**Mash:**   
What?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They're not Servants, but a type of monster. Does this mean...that goddess...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Set us up? Oh, hahaha...  
   
**Skeleton Soldier:**   
(clank, clank, clank)  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nero:**   
What's going on here? This cave is full of skeletons!   
   
**Mash:**   
Well, let's hope they're just skeletons...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Multiple signatures incoming! I think a lot of skeletons are coming...  
   
**Nero:**   
Mm, mmm, mmm! Sword-wielding skeletons aren't treasure by a long shot!   
   
**Mash:**   
Please give me your orders, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nero:**   
Phew, I'm getting a little exhausted...I want to go back and rest...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But what do you know? Looks like we reached the back of the cave while fighting.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm getting a unique signature there. This amount of energy&ndash;No, that's not possible.   
   
**Mash:**   
What is it, Doctor? Could the Holy Grail really be here?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No...no, it's not the Holy Grail at all! It's a Phantasmal,not a dragon, but a powerful mystical beast!   
   
**F：???:**  
GARRRRRRRRRR!!   
   
**Mash:**   
This is&ndash;  
   
**Nero:**   
It's so huge! Oh, but that lion has a cute face!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's a chimera, a legendary beast of ancient Greece. This is not a product of magecraft, but a true mystical beast!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Why would a thing like this be here? Oh, I know why. That goddess.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's powerful and has considerable toughness, so be careful!   
   
**Mash:**   
Roger. Master, commencing battle!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Stheno:**   
Haha. Welcome back, did you enjoy your special reward to the fullest?   
   
**Nero:**   
I'm tired...so exhausted...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I'm sure...Consecutive battles in a closed space will wear you out beyond belief...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm totally wiped out...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I think you should rest immediately...Should we return to the ship?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This is nothing!   
   
**Mash:**   
Are you sure? Senpai, at times you display extraordinary endurance...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Really, you're so lame! I could've taken on a big cat like that without breaking a sweat!   
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Ahahahaha!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, I'm sensing two enemies. Either lizards, dragons, or maybe idols...  
   
**Mash:**   
At any rate, we're going to take them out!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No, that's Elisabeth!   
   
**Mash:**   
I know, I know!   
   
**Mash:**   
But she's dangerous, Senpai. I have a feeling that she might screw everything up!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I agree...Let's pretend we don't notice her,so we can get away with it Fujimaru!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okay, let's beat them up!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's the right choice. I'm sure they will bring up some absolute nonsense!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What, that reaction again! You ugly, weird deerlet!   
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Ahahahaha!   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, a weird person told me I'm weird!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There, there.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She's the weird one.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hmph, I guess that cave was really tough. Well, it can't be helped with the Puppy's ability.   
   
**Nero:**   
...Who the hell are you, appearing all of a sudden and talking nonsense?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Who the hell are YOU? Oh, I'm not sensing any magical energy...wait a human? You?   
   
**Nero:**   
Not sure why you're so surprised. You are rude and insensitive. I would have slashed you already if you didn't look so cute.   
   
**Nero:**   
I'm Nero Claudius, the emperor of this era.... Um, why are you looking at me like that?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Are you kidding me? The real Nero?!   
   
**Mash:**   
The real...  
   
**Nero:**   
What do you mean by "real? "  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Ahahahaha!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is worse than France! I'm even more confused about what's going on!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Stheno:**   
Anyway, when I materialized in this world I dragged these two with me.   
   
**Stheno:**   
I didn't feel like I'd be able to complete the Heroes' Cave on my own.   
   
**Stheno:**   
So I had these two serve as my testers for the cave, that's all I think?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Hmph, it was a totally boring dungeon. Oh, but a live show in an underground cave is a new concept, right?   
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Ahahaha!   
   
**Stheno:**   
So you know Elisabeth. What about this one?   
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Ahahaha!   
   
**Mash:**   
Uh no...we've never met. Although, I know she's a Servant&mdash;  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Ahahaha! All right, let's introduce ourselves!   
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I am Tamamo Cat, one of the Tamamo Nine!   
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I tag "woof" at the end of my sentences. My hobby is cafe management. My favorite food is carrots.   
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Hmm. That's pretty inconsistent even for me. Woof woof.   
   
**Nero:**   
She talked!   
   
**Mash:**   
She did that on purpose, too. Woof!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Neutral, huh? I'm glad she's not a hostile Servant. Or maybe I should say I'm glad she's not our ally?   
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I was laughing because it was fun. I'm a laughing drunk.   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, s-sure.   
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
I'm Tamamo Cat, one of the Tamamo Nine! Can I speak in cat language?   
   
**Mash:**   
What?   
   
**Nero:**   
What's the Tamamo Nine?   
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
No? How about dog language?   
   
**Nero:**   
Umu?   
   
**Stheno:**   
Hehe! Your reaction was better than I thought. It requires technique to communicate with her.   
   
**Stheno:**   
Thank you, Tamamo Cat. But why weren't you in the treasure chest?   
   
**Stheno:**   
You were supposed to be the last trick. After they dealt with the chimera, you should've come out.   
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Now I'll get my carrots as the reward!   
   
**Stheno:**   
Did you eat the chest? Oh my...okay. I understand.   
   
**Nero:**   
H-Hmm. Their conversation seems to be working out...  
   
**Nero:**   
She's a goddess after all. She doesn't even flinch at that oddball.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, well. Though this island has been somewhat fun,I guess we came here for nothing.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You sound like it's not your problem...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Probably.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ahahaha! It happens! Don't look so depressed. Why don't we return to Rome for now&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But it looks like we can't! There's a Servant over there!   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
Huh? (←Servant)  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
Indeed. (←Servant)  
   
**Stheno:**   
Oh? (←Servant)  
   
**Mash:**   
Doc? (←Demi Servant)  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry, that didn't come out right! There's another Servant besides you guys, it's coming from the sea!   
   
**Caligula:**   
My!   
   
**Caligula:**   
My! My...actions...are...fate!   
   
**Caligula:**   
Sacrifice your life! Sacrifice your flesh!   
   
**Nero:**   
Uncle?   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
What? Who? Nero's uncle?   
   
**Stheno:**   
He seems to be pretty "tangled up. "That's how one should deal with Servants, I suppose.   
   
**Stheno:**   
&ndash;That's just bad taste.   
   
**Caligula:**   
Beautiful...You're beautiful...  
   
**Elisabeth:**   
You popped out of nowhere and now you're hitting on girls? W-What's with you, I know I am an attractive idol and all.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
But acting like a lowly beast is the worst! What kind of royalty are you?   
   
**Caligula:**   
Beautiful...Really beautiful! You are beautiful!   
   
**Caligula:**   
I want to take it, lust over it, and tear it apart. Your purity, your divine beauty, everything!   
   
**Caligula:**   
I want to trample all over you with my entire body! I...love...you, my beloved sister's child&ndash;  
   
**Caligula:**   
&ndash;Nerooooo!!   
   
**Nero:**   
...That's right. You are a beast. You are no longer my uncle!   
   
**Nero:**   
My uncle is dead. I still can't stop thinking about his regrettable death.   
   
**Nero:**   
But still, if you appear before me after being lost in death...  
   
**Nero:**   
...Then I shall sing a requiem for you. Know it's my duty as your niece, and as a proper emperor!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, this is going to be a Servant battle. Your orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Caligula:**   
Nero...Nero...My...beautiful...niece...  
   
**Caligula:**   
You...are...so...very...beautiful...  
   
**Caligula:**   
More so than...the goddess...of the moon...More than...the radiance of...the Holy Grail...  
   
**Nero:**   
Uncle...  
   
**Nero:**   
...I've defeated the enemy commander, Caligula. I've slaughtered yet another pretender to the throne!   
   
**Nero:**   
What a splendid job. Thank you Mash, Fujimaru.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It was nothing.   
   
**Nero:**   
Oh, it was definitely something. Now I'll have to think up another reward.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you all right?   
   
**Nero:**   
You really are kind, Fujimaru. But no need to worry, I am the emperor of Rome after all.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Anyways, you guys have saved me so many times.   
   
**Nero:**   
I can assure you that the reward for the defeat of the United Empire's shall be grand.   
   
**Nero:**   
I won't send a monster and say, "Here, it's your reward. "  
   
**Stheno:**   
Are you talking to me? You, not a Servant, but a mere human?   
   
**Stheno:**   
The queen of this era seems to be brave.   
   
**Stheno:**   
You might actually be a proper hero. Oh, how I wish you were a man.   
   
**Nero:**   
No, I am not a queen or a hero. Listen well, I am&ndash;  
   
**Nero:**   
&ndash;I am, the Fifth Emperor of the Roman Empire!   
   
**Stheno:**   
Yes of course, that's what I shall call you. The Fifth Emperor of the Roman Empire.   
   
**Stheno:**   
As a special gift, I'll give you a real goddess' blessing. This time it won't be a monster.   
   
**Stheno:**   
It is also my thanks, for taking out a Servant who was not a hero.   
   
**Stheno:**   
Your enemy, this so-called United Empire, and the gathering ground for their "emperors"&ndash;  
   
**Stheno:**   
The United Empire capital. I shall tell you its exact location.   
   
**Nero:**   
!!!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is...an unexpected reward. Good thing we got into the cave, eh guys?   
   
**Mash:**   
R-Really?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Dr. Roman didn't do anything.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The cave had nothing to do with it.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Y-Yes. T-That's right. Sorry.   
   
**Elisabeth:**   
...  (←Did nothing)  
   
**Tamamo Cat:**   
...  (←Did nothing)  
   
## Section 10: Triumph   
   
**Mash:**   
It won't be long until we're in Rome again. Good work on the way back, Senpai.   
   
**Nero:**   
Why won't you go by horseback Fujimaru? I know, I should've provided a chariot.   
   
**Nero:**   
I apologize, the few soldiers left in my unit are brilliant, but none of them fights on chariots.   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
Your Majesty, should I provide a chariot for the next expedition?   
   
**Nero:**   
I'm sure we'll need one anyway. After all, next time we'll be attacking the United Empire capital!   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
Sir!   
   
**Nero:**   
Yes, yes.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Your Majesty, we seem to be under attack. Enemy brigade up ahead. Multiple signatures.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
That's strange...We're running into the same amount of enemies as before.   
   
**Nero:**   
You're right. Even though we already regained control of nearby Gaul.   
   
**Nero:**   
Don't tell me they're attacking from the sea! If our scouts haven't noticed, then...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The scouts were discovered and killed. We might be dealing with an elite battalion.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well, that explains it. But if so, that would mean&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's as I feared. I'm detecting even more enemies now!   
   
**Mash:**   
Brave soldiers, please be safe. I'm going to do what I can.   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
Good luck to you too, Miss Mash!   
   
**Mash:**   
Your orders please, Master. Commencing battle.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nero:**   
Those soldiers just now&ndash;They're not like the ones we've run into before.   
   
**Nero:**   
Not that they looked much different, but...  
   
**Mash:**   
True, rather than human soldiers, they feel like Servants.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yet they're not really Servants per se. Doctor, do you have an idea?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I can think of several possibilities. Not good. Things like this are typically related to Noble Phantasms.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And I don't mean typical Noble Phantasms. The type that's designed for use on the battlefield.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In which case&ndash;  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...Master, I'm sensing the presence of a Servant. There's one...no, several hundred!   
   
**Mash:**   
It's the same presence from before. But I can only tell that one of them is an actual Servant.   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
Enemy attack! Several hundred enemy soldiers!   
   
**Nero:**   
Is this an ambush? Where did several hundred enemies come from?   
   
**F：???:**  
It's not an ambush. I chose to defend this place, that's all.   
   
**F：???:**  
You people trespassed into my stronghold. So I shall defend it.   
   
**F：???:**  
I will crush any and all enemies more valiantly than any attack, and far stronger than any defense.   
   
**F：???:**  
This is how we Spartans fight. You will soon experience it for yourselves.   
   
**Mash:**   
Did you just say Sparta? Then you are&ndash;  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Servant, Lancer. My True Name is Leonidas.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He's not hiding his True Name. Just like last time,this is far different than a normal Holy Grail War.   
   
**Nero:**   
Leonidas? You introduce yourself as King Leonidas of Sparta?   
   
**Leonidas:**   
Precisely. It is an immoral war, but I'm still going to destroy you.   
   
**Nero:**   
What! You are the legendary Leonidas,the guardian of the Hot Gates!   
   
**Nero:**   
So the "emperors" aren't the only ones who came back? Hmm, then what about Boudica?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Stay focused on the battle!   
   
**Nero:**   
U-Umu?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We met Elisabeth, too, remember?   
   
**Nero:**   
Ah, now that you mention it. Hmm, but then is Boudica...  
   
**Nero:**   
Is she also dead? Is that it?   
   
**Nero:**   
Or was she alive? I told her, "This time, surrender yourself to Rome. " Thinking that was the case...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
N-Never mind that Nero, there are many enemies. We must strengthen our defenses!   
   
**Nero:**   
U-Umu, our unit is quite small. I hope we're able to defend...  
   
**Mash:**   
If we defeat the main Servant, the remaining hundreds should be gone. In that case&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, it's a Servant battle. Your orders, please!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Leonidas:**   
Just as I thought, huh? In a battle with nothing to protect...  
   
**Nero:**   
He vanished? So he wasn't meant to exist in this world after all.   
   
**Mash:**   
...He was a formidable enemy. Just what you'd expect of the ultimate defensive Heroic Spirit.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No signs of Servants or humans around us. No Phantasmals, either.   
   
**Nero:**   
Then let's head back to Rome! Mash, Fujimaru, you can hold your heads up high!   
   
**Nero:**   
Umu, you in particular Mash. Your skills aren't as good as mine, but they are quite good.   
   
**Mash:**   
N-Not really...  
   
**Nero:**   
Haha! Hold your head up high with pride! This is our triumphant return from Gaul, after all!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Nero:**   
Phew...At last, things have settled down.   
   
**Mash:**   
That was an unbelievable crowd. It was like a festival. Senpai, you got squished pretty hard, didn't you?   
   
**Mash:**   
But you didn't seem that uncomfortable. Maybe you like that sort of thing?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, yeah.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can't be helped if it's a festival...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I see, I see, at festivals, everyone becomes friendly, right?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Haha. I bet you didn't mind at all. That's what you call a victory wine!   
   
**Nero:**   
Ah unseen mage, you speak as though you've actually tasted some?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hahaha, I have a vivid imagination. Which has led me into all kinds of situations.   
   
**Nero:**   
Mash, you protected us well. Do you not like being touched?   
   
**Nero:**   
As expected, the great warrior of shield swore loyalty only to me. It makes me like you even more.   
   
**Mash:**   
T-Thank you. It's nice of you to say that...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why are you looking at me?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm glad that she likes you  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes...Well, no. Nothing. I have nothing to say.   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
Your Majesty! The special expedition force is heading back to Rome!   
   
**Nero:**   
What&ndash;? Those people are coming back?   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
Yes, both generals are alive and well! But now they are tied down due to a massive attack by the United Empire!   
   
**Nero:**   
That's not good. I'm sorry, Mash, Fujimaru!   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. Senpai, your orders please.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go help them.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Orders are orders.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;Understood.   
   
**G：???:**  
  
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)  
   
**H：???:**  
We're completely surrounded. Nothing but swarms of enemies around us.   
   
**H：???:**  
That shouldn't be a problem, but...  
   
**G：???:**  
  
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)  
   
**H：???:**  
Yeah, we'll probably lose the soldiers Nero Claudius provided for us. I'd like to avoid that if possible.   
   
**H：???:**  
Find a way out of an impossible situation&ndash;  
   
**H：???:**  
People like you and me can get through it on our own, but it would be too harsh to force them to do that.   
   
**H：???:**  
What should we do? ...Huh?   
   
**G：???:**  
  
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)  
   
**H：???:**  
Reinforcements, huh? Though I heard Boudica and Spartacus were in Gaul.   
   
**Mash:**   
...You must be Jing Ke. I recognize you from your description. Looks like we met up with them, Master.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm relieved.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. We made it.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I thought it was all over  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. I was a little nervous when we broke through the enemy's line, but...  
   
**Mash:**   
They are human forces. The degree of risk is relatively low.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
You look unfamiliar, but you don't seem to be an enemy.   
   
**Mash:**   
No we're not, we are reinforcements from Rome. You guys are&ndash;  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Let's talk later. You're Servants, too, aren't you?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Then, let's find a way out together. My hope is to bring as many soldiers back to Rome as possible.   
   
**Mash:**   
Of course. Master, massive enemy troops ahead. Your orders, please!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
We have destroyed the enemy forces and sustained only minor casualties. Good work Senpai!   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Thank you again, looks like I didn't lose my borrowed troops.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
I'm Assassin, Jing Ke. Like you, I'm a guest commander under Nero Claudius.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
I was drawn by the prospect of killing multiple"emperors," but now I'm being treated like a general.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Of course...My main activities are reconnaissance and assassination.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
It's his job to do the actual work on the battlefield. Lu Bu&ndash;...hm...where's he gone after chasing those enemies?   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
...Hm. I'm sure he'll be back eventually.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Jing Ke. The legendary Chinese assassin? No wonder you're obsessed with killing emperors.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Huh&ndash;?   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Mash and Fujimaru,I see that you are visitors from another era.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
I understand your circumstances. That said, it doesn't change what we must do here.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
We are here to slaughter the "emperors. "Me and Lu Bu.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
We've already killed three enemy "emperor" Servants. It's going to be a competition with you guys.   
   
**Mash:**   
S-Sure. Competition...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We are not losing to you.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Is that so?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We've killed only two so far...  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Don't be so depressed. You still have a chance to catch up.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
As soon as we're back in Rome,Nero's full-scale invasion of the United Empire will start.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
And there comes the race. We count heads of "emperors," or enemy generals.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Our team or your team, which one gets more&ndash;Heh, now I have something to look forward to.   
   
**Mash:**   
W-Well. Something to look forward to...  
   
**Mash:**   
(...I can't, Senpai. I can't maintain the conversation. )  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's okay. Me neither.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You just have to do your best  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
(H-Hey, Senpai! )  
   
**Lev:**   
&ndash;So they failed to eliminate Lu Bu.   
   
**H：???:**  
...What should we do, Lev Lainur?   
   
**Lev:**   
There's nothing to worry about. Don't forget that I have the Holy Grail. I told you before, didn't I?   
   
**Lev:**   
I'm capable of summoning Servants at will. No matter how powerful they may be!   
   
**F：???:**  
...Servant Rider, huh? Hmm, I guess, that's my class?   
   
**F：???:**  
So? What should I do, Master?   
   
**Lev:**   
Eliminate Nero Claudius immediately. Destroy this era, and crush the foundation of humanity.   
   
**H：???:**  
...I'll lend you my troops. Use them as you see fit.   
   
**F：???:**  
Got it. In short, you want me to start a war, right?   
   
**H：???:**  
...Exactly.   
   
**F：???:**  
War. War, hmm. War, huh? I guess I'm very good at that.   
   
**F：???:**  
All right, if you insist I'll borrow your troops&ndash;  
   
## Section 11: Attack the United Empire   
   
**E：???:**  
&ndash;That sums up Nero Claudius' army.   
   
**E：???:**  
All the details are in the report. Look it over later.   
   
**E：???:**  
One comment from me. Think of the enemy commander, Lu Bu as a disaster.   
   
**E：???:**  
The same goes for Spartacus. It's no use confronting them head-on.   
   
**E：???:**  
That said, these disasters can be dealt with. The two Berserkers are like automatic machines.   
   
**E：???:**  
It should be easy to "lure" them. Luckily, they didn't materialize as other classes.   
   
**F：???:**  
Guess our luck is turning. Were my Luck parameters that high?   
   
**E：???:**  
Luck that's already played out is nothing but reality. Meaning that reality is working in your favor, nothing more.   
   
**F：???:**  
Oh? You can look at it that way too, I guess.   
   
**F：???:**  
It doesn't matter either way. I want to see her face.   
   
**F：???:**  
Nero Claudius. The fifth emperor of the Roman Empire.   
   
**F：???:**  
What kind of king is she? No, what kind of emperor is she, I should say.   
   
**E：???:**  
I will make your wish come true. No matter what.   
   
**F：???:**  
Thank you, but I kind of feel weird.   
   
**F：???:**  
I'm what you may consider a curveball as a Heroic Spirit, so my "memory" is a little different too.   
   
**F：???:**  
It seems a little bit off, that you became my teacher.   
   
**E：???:**  
Those are my words. Can you imagine being sent back in time, and becoming a vessel for a Heroic Spirit I have no connections with.   
   
**E：???:**  
What happened to me in my own era? Did I switch with this Heroic Spirit?   
   
**E：???:**  
Or did the time in "my era" stop, and I'm here as myself, integrated with this Heroic Spirit?   
   
**E：???:**  
...I have no idea what's going on.   
   
**F：???:**  
But you came here anyway. As my new teacher.   
   
**F：???:**  
Right, Mr. Zhuge Liang.   
   
**E：???:**  
No. Well, as a Heroic Spirit, that may be true.   
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
&ndash;I am Lord El-Melloi II.   
   
**Mash:**   
And&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
The true Roman Empire Army has started its attack. The United Empire is being invaded.   
   
**Mash:**   
Jing Ke already came back with intel. A city resembling Rome indeed exists in the specified location.   
   
**Mash:**   
This is the place Stheno was talking about. This is the real blessing from the goddess.   
   
**Mash:**   
Boudica and Spartacus of Gaul, along with Lu Bu and Jing Ke.   
   
**Mash:**   
An army commanding five Servants, including me. That is the true Roman Imperial Army led by Emperor Nero.   
   
**Mash:**   
It's a force that no standard army can match. Yet the United Empire force won't send in their Servants.   
   
**Mash:**   
No sign of Lev Lainur either. Everyday, we advance further.   
   
**Mash:**   
We certainly have the upper hand now. The Imperial Army is marching toward the enemy capital with unbelievable momentum.   
   
**Mash:**   
In the meantime, I&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
will do this&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What are you doing?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai? Fou?!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you keeping a journal?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**Mash:**   
Well...Senpai, Fou, yes that's right. To tell you the truth&ndash;  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Doctor asked me. To keep a journal, like a military record.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's right, I'm the one who asked. To take advantage of the fact that you became a Roman viceroy!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What do you think about "Novus Commentarii de Bello Gallico"? This title is an homage to the book written by Caesar.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That sounds interesting, right? Though you do have to cover the part where a god showed up...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you planning to publish this?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wouldn't that be breach of confidentiality?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I suppose you're right. Well then, let's talk about something serious!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Let's assume you guys could save the world. I thought about what would come after that.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even if the world is saved, the tragedy of Chaldea will never be reversed.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In other words&ndash;there's no guarantee for our salary.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You understand the rest, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
I see. You mean prevention is better than the cure,but why are you the one avoiding physical labor, Doctor?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, it's a joke, it's a joke. Why would I count my chickens before they hatch when the world's about to end?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What's happening in Rome is exactly like a war. In order to grasp the situation correctly, I just use the best means.   
   
**Mash:**   
I understand its purpose now. In that case, I will dispose of this journal right away.   
   
**Mash:**   
Regarding the war record, I will deliver it to Da Vinci later.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good! Look how well you've been trained! Damn!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash is right.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What a waste to throw it away.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?   
   
**Nero:**   
Mmm, what? What are you talking about?   
   
**Nero:**   
Fujimaru always seems to be having fun. You should let me in on it, too.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Hey! You know this is not the time to be fooling around. We've detected the enemy.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You're right, multiple signatures. I am not picking up any Servants, it's a regular military force.   
   
**Nero:**   
Hmmm. I was just about to have a lovely conversation...what a disappointment...  
   
**Nero:**   
It's okay. First, we'll get rid of them. What can mere United Empire troops do to us!   
   
**Nero:**   
I shall take in those who surrender! Pledge fealty to my Rome, and your life will be spared!   
   
**Boudica:**   
Your Rome, I see.   
   
**Nero:**   
Huh?   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, we should go too. If we can crush the leading units, we can demoralize their troops.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Understood!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't overdo it.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. Let's go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
...That's all. Already, the United Empire is without clear leadership.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
All we encountered are small random skirmishes with independent enemy units.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
It's safe to assume that the situation looks positive.   
   
**Nero:**   
Umu! In other words, my army has regained its true power, right?   
   
**Nero:**   
No, I have Mash and the others, as well. These traitors have no chance against my forces!   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Carelessness could be fatal, Nero Claudius. Life can be extinguished without you even knowing it.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
The United Empire defense is still formidable. That's also why we only run into weaker units.   
   
**Nero:**   
U-Umu. Jing Ke is so cautious.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Have you forgotten? I assassinate others for a living.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Plotting is my specialty and at the same time, it's what I'm most wary of.   
   
**Nero:**   
Umu...  
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
Pardon me, Your Majesty! Enemy troops are ahead! Also they are behind us!   
   
**Mash:**   
Behind us?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I believe General Lu Bu was in the rearguard,Spartacus as well. We can't leave them like that&ndash;  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
This is not good.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Once the fight starts, those two will probably chase the enemy to the ends of the earth...  
   
**Nero:**   
That's why we placed them in the rearguard. To capture the capital as planned...but it backfired.   
   
**Nero:**   
We can't lose those generals! I'm sorry, Mash,Fujimaru, I am counting on you!   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood. I just need to stop the rear enemy troops, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
I am relatively good at fighting defensively. I want to emphasize...'relatively. '  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's hurry up!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't over do it.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
We've crushed the enemy forces, and destroyed all the monsters.   
   
**Mash:**   
We somehow made it&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Not yet! Multiple signatures! What's this? The enemy forces are even stronger than before!   
   
**Mash:**   
Another battle! Master, your orders please!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Did we stop them? Looks like the rest retreated. Good job, Mash, Fujimaru!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We were able to save Lu Bu and Spartacus. Dear me, let's take a breather.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
From now on, let's protect our rearguard as well. The enemy seems to understand how our army works.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Did you sense any Servants? I couldn't detect anything from here.   
   
**Mash:**   
There were no signs of such during the battle. Except for the four in our own forces. Oh wait...  
   
**Mash:**   
Jing Ke often extinguishes her presence. So to be precise, that's three Servants.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's Assassin's Presence Concealment skill. I can't detect her from here, either.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I don't think an Assassin is involved. In this case&ndash;  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
It must be directed...There must be an enemy general who's adept at commanding.   
   
**Mash:**   
I wonder if it's one of the "emperors. "  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
I don't know. But we will find out soon.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**F：???:**  
  
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)   
   
**Nero:**   
Wh-What's this sound? A beast howling?   
   
**Mash:**   
No, it's a Servant's presence. It's possible that an enemy Servant has appeared.   
   
**Nero:**   
A big gun like Mash and the others? An enemy commander? In that case, one of the "emperors"&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
First, let's draw back our men. Humans don't stand a chance against that, they'll be slaughtered!   
   
**Nero:**   
Right, gotcha! So the instant we move Boudica to the rear, this happens?   
   
**Mash:**   
Let's head to the front. Master!   
   
**Mash:**   
I have them in my sights. That's...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm picking up multiple magical energy signatures. All belong to that of necromancy, but with this number...perhaps a Caster?   
   
**Mash:**   
Multiple non-human, hostile creatures. We haven't confirmed the source of the roar.   
   
**Mash:**   
It may be a Berserker. Master, we should eradicate this group of hostile creatures.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Please!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Pay attention to Servants!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Looks like a Servant was summoned in the enemy vanguard. Was it that Court Mage's doing&ndash;  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
No, it couldn't have been. In that case, was it you?   
   
**F：???:**  
I don't know. All I did was gallop my horse.   
   
**F：???:**  
I thought they'd be on their way by now. I never thought it would be this soon.   
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Oh?   
   
**F：???:**  
Have you heard the rumors about the Mediterranean goddess? They say that aside from her, there are two female monsters.   
   
**F：???:**  
So you see...It hit me.   
   
**F：???:**  
A Chained Summon. If such a thing could be possible.   
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
I don't like battles that rely on luck.   
   
**F：???:**  
Please don't say that. You're the one who created that opening in their vanguard.   
   
**F：???:**  
Let's get ready now, while he's buying us time.   
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
...Are you sure?   
   
**F：???:**  
About?   
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
If he materialized through the chained summon,then most likely he's&ndash;  
   
**F：???:**  
Yes, I think he's Darius III. The fearless Persian King and my forever rival in life.   
   
**F：???:**  
However, right now, I feel that I know that as a kind of future.   
   
**F：???:**  
It's okay. I fought him once, and will fight him again.   
   
**F：???:**  
And I want to fight him again. But not right now.   
   
**F：???:**  
Right now, it's Nero Claudius. I want to talk to that person.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Darius III:**   
  
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Amazing, I can almost feel the air vibrations over here! Magical energy signature confirmed. He's a Servant!   
   
**Mash:**   
Linguistic communication impossible, it's an enemy Servant. Master, your orders!   
   
**Darius III:**   
  
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)   
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't get swallowed up!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We can beat it!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;Right!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
We have defeated the enemy Servant. Good job, Master.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You're really getting hang of fighting Servants. Your experiences are coming in handy, well done.   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh no Doctor, I think it's because of Master's precise orders.   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
Commander Fujimaru, Commander Mash,a message! It's from Her Majesty the Emperor.   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
There's been an ambush in the rear, both General Spartacus and General Lu Bu have left the battlefield.   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, no! So the enemy deployed a two-front attack?   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
The two generals have defeated the enemy forces, but they've broken away in pursuit of remnants!   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
Then another force launched a surprise attack from both sides. General Boudica fell into the enemy's hands and was taken prisoner!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is...Mmmm, this is not good at all...  
   
**Nero:**   
...  
   
**Nero:**   
...  
   
**Nero:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;Nero.   
   
**Nero:**   
Hmm? Oh, I seemed to be deep in thought. I have made my decision.   
   
**Mash:**   
(Seemed? )  
   
**Nero:**   
Our forces were outmatched in the previous battle...I will accept this as a stern truth.   
   
**Nero:**   
My generals are just as capable as the enemy"emperors. " But two of them left the front line, and one is captured by the enemy.   
   
**Nero:**   
There is nothing we can do about those two. No, it was my mistake.   
   
**Nero:**   
It might take a little bit of time, but I'm willing to believe Lu Bu and Spartacus will return to us.   
   
**Nero:**   
Therefore, at this point&ndash;We will save Boudica!   
   
**Nero:**   
Fortunately, Jing Ke found the location of enemy fort. We will charge in, destroy the fort, and save Boudica.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmmm...  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, something wrong?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I just feel uneasy. The one who captured Boudica is supposed to be a Servant.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's not something a regular human can do, but why are they barricading themselves in a fort?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's not that far from the United Empire capital. So it should be convenient to get back there.   
   
**Mash:**   
The enemy is trying to lure us in. Is that what this means?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If they just want to destroy our force, the approach I mentioned earlier should be "better. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We have at least two Servants. They should understand that too.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's why they cut off Lu Bu and Spartacus in such a spectacular manner.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Humans and Servants, I think the enemy has a good grasp of the clear difference.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Now, Fujimaru. It's time for a decision.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're going to rescue Boudica.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see. I knew you'd say that.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You're too optimistic. We're at war. We need a strategic point of view.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If it's a trap, we'll crush it.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai. You're starting to think like a Berserker.   
   
**Mash:**   
I understand more Berserkers have materialized this time, but I don't think it's a good idea to be influenced by them.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
But...I don't believe your way of thinking is bad.   
   
**Nero:**   
You understand me, Fujimaru. In that case, let's conquer together. Our target is the enemy base!   
   
**Nero:**   
We will take it at once! My loyal soldiers, attack with caution!   
   
## Section 12: Rescue Boudica   
   
**Mash:**   
I am sensing Servants nearby. Please be careful, they're very close.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm picking up two signatures from here. You're looking at a battle with multiple Servants. Watch your back!   
   
**Nero:**   
Where are you Boudica? Answer me!   
   
**Nero:**   
I know you can't be dead yet! I can tell, I can tell. You would never die!   
   
**F：???:**  
...No, no. Isn't that a rather selfish way to put it?   
   
**F：???:**  
Rest assured, she's safe. Right now, she's fast asleep thanks to his spells.   
   
**E：???:**  
It's a Restraint Spell. Not like being fast asleep.   
   
**F：???:**  
But she really was sleeping. Fast asleep.   
   
**Nero:**   
...You bastards. I'm surprised that you'd show your faces.   
   
**Nero:**   
I assume you're both leaders of this fort. I shall allow it, tell me your names.   
   
**F：???:**  
You're making us tell you our names? Hmm, let's see...How should I put this?   
   
**F：???:**  
I have several names. It's hard to pick one, hmm.   
   
**F：???:**  
&ndash;All right, this is what I'm gonna do.   
   
**Alexander:**   
My name is Alexander. To be precise, that's Alexander III.   
   
**Alexander:**   
So, he's&ndash;  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Lord El-Melloi II. Due to certain reasons,or should I say fate, I am his strategist.   
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
I am not a true Heroic Spirit. I'd probably have another name as a Heroic Spirit.   
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
Therefore, it's okay to forget my name.   
   
**Alexander:**   
That doesn't work. We are the enemy generals to her.   
   
**Alexander:**   
Right, Roman Emperor?   
   
**Nero:**   
Of course...what? Now that it's come to this,don't tell me you're not going to fight.   
   
**Alexander:**   
Exactly.   
   
**Nero:**   
W-What?   
   
**Mash:**   
You aren't going to fight? You aren't the enemy Servants?   
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
I'm a "drop out," I don't have a Master. Alexander, however, is a different story.   
   
**Alexander:**   
I guess I didn't get along with my Master. That's why I'm here of my own will.   
   
**Alexander:**   
I was waiting here. For you to show up.   
   
**Nero:**   
For...me? You were waiting?   
   
**Alexander:**   
Yes, I'm a little bit interested. That's why I teased you here and there.   
   
**Alexander:**   
I wanted to talk to you.   
   
**Alexander:**   
If possible&ndash;right here in the middle of the battlefield.   
   
**Alexander:**   
Thank you, Lord El-Melloi II. You made my selfish wish come true.   
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
What are you talking about? More than half of them were your directions.   
   
**Nero:**   
???  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai! Your Majesty! The enemy soldiers are coming, their target is Your Majesty!   
   
**Nero:**   
Ugh, a pincer attack!?   
   
**Alexander:**   
Yes, don't worry. We won't do anything, but&ndash;  
   
**Alexander:**   
The United Empire soldiers won't stop. Once they notice you, they will attack automatically.   
   
**Mash:**   
They're coming!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Intercept them!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Protect Nero!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Got it, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Alexander:**   
...Is it over?   
   
**Alexander:**   
All right, let's talk. We need to hurry,or both your soldiers and mine will die off.   
   
**Alexander:**   
It's not my intention. That's why&ndash;  
   
**Alexander:**   
&mdash;C'mon. "Let's talk. "  
   
**Nero:**   
...I don't understand, not one bit. At the very least, my men were killed by your army!   
   
**Nero:**   
It's happening even now. Knowing that...  
   
**Nero:**   
...Are you still saying your purpose is to talk? You bastard!   
   
**Alexander:**   
Yes.   
   
**Alexander:**   
I do believe that human lives are sacred. Even I believe that.   
   
**Alexander:**   
But you see, I think that this is the best way.   
   
**Alexander:**   
Because you caught my attention Fifth Emperor of the Roman Empire, Nero Claudius.   
   
**Alexander:**   
Why is it&ndash;&ndash;that you fight?   
   
**Alexander:**   
Why would you not show allegiance to the United Empire, and keep fighting like that? No, "like this. "  
   
**Alexander:**   
If you chose to be one of the united "emperors,"you could've avoided many unnecessary conflicts.   
   
**Nero:**   
Unnecessary...  
   
**Nero:**   
Did you call this fight unnecessary? How dare you.   
   
**Alexander:**   
I did. So what are you going to do?   
   
**Nero:**   
...I won't forgive you.   
   
**Nero:**   
It doesn't matter if you're my resurrected kin...or a wise ruler from the past...  
   
**Nero:**   
Or a brave general from an ancient era...or even if you're a legendary king yourself...  
   
**Nero:**   
The only one suitable to be emperor is none other than Nero Claudius!   
   
**Nero:**   
Loved by the people, allowed to love them, wanted by them...There is only one! The one and only ruler!   
   
**Nero:**   
A shining star like so! Arrogant to carry all the burden like so!   
   
**Nero:**   
Even if all the Gods of Rome descend and tell her to surrender to the United Empire, she'll never back down!   
   
**Nero:**   
How can I back down! Such is my life to believe in this philosophy, such is my fate!   
   
**Nero:**   
I won't back down, I will rule and I will prosper gloriously. I am, without a doubt, Rome itself!   
   
**Alexander:**   
Splendid! That's exactly what I wanted to hear.   
   
**Alexander:**   
You pass. Go forth and become a ruler. No, an emperor! You have the right to do so!   
   
**Alexander:**   
A rose that attracts glory and prosperity! A sin only allowed for humans, a Beast that shows the number of the Fallen.   
   
**Alexander:**   
You can even "become the Devil! "Yes, you!   
   
**Nero:**   
Shut up, shut up, shut up! You don't need to say any more, so!   
   
**Nero:**   
Mash, Fujimaru! I need your help. Take this bastard&ndash;  
   
**Nero:**   
&ndash;down!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Alexander:**   
I have one more thing to say to you, my adorable emperor.   
   
**Alexander:**   
That pride of yours...Its blossom,it's radiance is sure to be revered, but...  
   
**Alexander:**   
I'm sure it can also be dangerous. Please...  
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
That's not for you&ndash;No, it's not your place to say.   
   
**El-Melloi II:**   
But it's so like you to meddle that way. Dear me.   
   
**Nero:**   
I am not wrong by any means. Not by any means...  
   
**Nero:**   
I am the only...Emperor...  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
## Section 13: Signal to the Final Battle   
   
**Nero:**   
Umu&mdash;In other words, it's the final showdown!   
   
**Nero:**   
Now is the time to gather my strength and yours, as my soldiers. With this battle, Rome will become one again!   
   
**Nero:**   
Those miserable pretenders to the throne...Now is the time for the false Rome to fall!   
   
**Nero:**   
Fight, my soldiers! As my swords, annihilate every one of those pretenders!   
   
**Nero:**   
My sword is the Original Flame, and the sound of it clashing is like a star streaking across the sky.   
   
**Nero:**   
Listen in awe and praise it! Rejoice, my Swords!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I could hear her voice and cheers over here, too. The troops' morale is sky-high.   
   
**Mash:**   
The battle has already started, but there's still no sign of any Servants.   
   
**Mash:**   
We'll be taking part in the palace raid. I hope we can find that court mage...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You mean Lev Lainur?   
   
**Mash:**   
I can't say for sure, but it's a strong possibility.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Professor Lev...  
   
**Mash:**   
A dangerous man who killed the Director, and proclaimed the world to have ended. There's no room for sympathy, Senpai.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash, Fujimaru, be extremely careful. Who knows what will happen if we run into the holder of the Grail.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A dragon was summoned with the power of the Grail last time. This time it might not just be used to summon Heroic Spirits.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Also&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, I've detected a Servant signature. It's close, you should be able to see it in front of you.   
   
**E：???:**  
...Brave ones.   
   
**E：???:**  
You are truly brave, and that is why you rule over the current Rome.   
   
**Nero:**   
Hmm&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
We've got visual confirmation. One large target, near the entrance to the palace.   
   
**Mash:**   
To us...he's talking to us. It seems Nero heard him too.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
His voices reaches this far even on the battlefield? As expected of Servants, even their vocal cords are different.    
   
**E：???:**  
I see. So you're Nero?   
   
**E：???:**  
How adorable. How beautiful. How gorgeous. I can see how you held Rome up with those slender arms of yours.   
   
**E：???:**  
Now, come.   
   
**E：???:**  
The past, the present, the future. All that is Rome loves you.   
   
**Nero:**   
What?   
   
**Nero:**   
What's...No, I-I can't...  
   
**Nero:**   
Would...that...even be...possible...No, no, but...  
   
**Mash:**   
Nero? You don't look well. Did someone cast some spell on you&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm not detecting any traces of magical energy. It's probably not due to magecraft or Servant Skills.   
   
**Mash:**   
Then what's&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do you know who that might be?   
   
**Nero:**   
W-Well...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Why are you so afraid?   
   
**Nero:**   
Afraid? A-And...just what would I be afraid of?   
   
**Nero:**   
I am the Roman Emperor...That's right, Rome...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Rome...But that person..."He" is...  
   
**Nero:**   
Just one glance...and I understand...He is truly...  
   
**Nero:**   
Rome, itself...  
   
**E：???:**  
I'm sure you understand, Nero.   
   
**E：???:**  
Now come back, come back to Rome my dear child.   
   
**E：???:**  
It's Rome. Rome is the true leader of the United Empire.   
   
**E：???:**  
You should join, as well. You shall be forgiven for everything. Rome shall forgive you.   
   
**E：???:**  
Rome will even love that inner beast of yours. Rome is the only one that can do that.   
   
**E：???:**  
That's right&ndash;  
   
**E：???:**  
I am Rome.   
   
**Nero:**   
I...You're...No, you're...  
   
**Nero:**   
You're...That's not possible...I...  
   
**Nero:**   
I had thought about it...I had believed. I had wanted to believe...  
   
**Nero:**   
However, you stand in my way! You are none other than Rome, the founding king of the nation.   
   
**Nero:**   
The Holy Progenitor, Romulus!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, there's a group of enemies headed this way! I believe they're going after Nero!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Intercept them!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's pull back!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Lu Bu:**   
  
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)   
   
**Spartacus:**   
Hahaha! Hahahahahahahaha! The day of liberation has come. Crush the oppressors with your will and bodies!   
   
**Roman Soldier:**   
The generals have returned! Victory is within our grasp! Glory to Her Majesty, the emperor!   
   
**Boudica:**   
...I see, the founding ruler.   
   
**Boudica:**   
So that's why she's acting like that. Such a gloomy face is sure to affect the troops' morale.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Emperor Nero? She doesn't look so gloomy.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Even as we speak, she's encouraging the troops on the battlefield. I'm sure there's no problem.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Well, she is acting cheerfully. But she's not as radiant as normal.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Well, right now we're fighting human soldiers, and the boss is hiding in the palace. It should be fine, but...  
   
**Boudica:**   
If that big one shows up again, we'll have a problem.   
   
**Boudica:**   
The morale of the United Empire troops is strangely high. The soldiers were all ready to sacrifice themselves.   
   
**Boudica:**   
More so, each capital civilian is acting like a soldier, and attacking our troops whenever in sight.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I am sure this is the charisma of that Holy Progenitor. The soldiers and people are acting like moths drawn to the flame.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
It's true they seem to be acting that way.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
People of the United Empire are blind. Though that may be proof that they're under proper leadership.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
However, our troops have high morale as well. Nero...is acting no different than usual.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm...not sure about that.   
   
**Mash:**   
I understand a little bit. It's her determination,or just general aura about her...  
   
**Mash:**   
It feels...a little bit lacking right now.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sure it came as a shock for her. The founder of the nation, King Romulus, is actually the enemy leader...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Romulus?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I thought he was some mythological figure...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, the founding-king, Romulus. The great hero who founded Rome upon the Septem Montes.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A great figure that deserves to be called the Progenitor of Rome. At any rate, he's the son of the War God Mars.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
So that means his Divinity level is quite high,since Mars is the equivalent of Ares the Greek God of War&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry, I'll get back on track. Either way...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It doesn't matter if he existed in history or not. Just like I've explained before, Heroic Spirits are the heroes people dreamt of.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In other words, Emperor Nero must have dreamt of Romulus, as well.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A dream of the shining hero who created Rome. I'm sure it was quite a shock when that person turned out to be an enemy.   
   
**Boudica:**   
It would be like if I was betrayed by the Celtic gods.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Something like that. Maybe also adding in being betrayed by your beloved husband.   
   
**Boudica:**   
My husband is the best husband there is. If the world turned inside-out, he still wouldn't betray me.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It was just an example, but it looks like it's time for you to go.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It isn't a Servant, but I am getting magical energy signatures. Might be some kind of monster.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
...I will search for a route to infiltrate the palace.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Then I will protect the soldiers and the Emperor. Mash, Fujimaru, can I leave this to you?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sure.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Thanks, I'm going to go save our silly emperor.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't expect too much from us.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Oh, but I will. Mash, you'll figure this out, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, of course. Senpai gets things done when the need is there.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Well then Master, commencing battle with the enemy creatures.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Nero:**   
...Mmm, so it's you.   
   
**Nero:**   
Where's Mash? Oh, the restroom? I guess this happens too.   
   
**Nero:**   
It's just you two seem to be joined at the hip, so I thought you'd be together during those times too, sorry.   
   
**Nero:**   
...  
   
**Nero:**   
...I made a fool out of myself, didn't I? I can't believe I'd lose it like that.   
   
**Nero:**   
Although I panicked a bit during the incidents with my uncle and Lord Caesar.   
   
**Nero:**   
This time, it hit home. Just a tiny bit, mind you...  
   
**Nero:**   
I...  
   
**Nero:**   
"Could it be? " I thought. Could it be that my path was mistaken?   
   
**Nero:**   
...Needless to say, that's not possible. I myself am Rome...its fifth emperor.   
   
**Nero:**   
But when I heard our founding ruler's voice,though it was for a brief moment, it did cross my mind.   
   
**Nero:**   
"Could it be? "  
   
**Nero:**   
The other day, I put up such an act, and now I'm being completely pathetic.   
   
**Nero:**   
But it crossed my mind. Could it be possible?   
   
**Nero:**   
Would it be better for me to just bow down to the Holy Progenitor? No, let's say it. I will say it.   
   
**Nero:**   
I wanted to. That's how I really, truly felt in my heart!   
   
**Nero:**   
The Holy Progenitor! With all of his faults, he founded this nation!   
   
**Nero:**   
If my path is wrong, if that is indeed the case, then I want to entrust everything to him as an "emperor" of the United Empire!   
   
**Nero:**   
But&ndash;  
   
**Nero:**   
I can't do that. That is the one thing I cannot do. The Holy Progenitor is definitely mistaken.   
   
**Nero:**   
Look at his people, look at his soldiers. Not a single one of them is smiling!   
   
**Nero:**   
No matter how perfect the reign may be, how can there be a nation without laughter!   
   
**Nero:**   
Which is why I...I...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're not wrong. Stay on your path!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're in the middle of a battle right now.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero:**   
...I know. Oh, I know!   
   
**Nero:**   
That's it. I forgot something important.   
   
**Nero:**   
No matter who the enemy might be, I must not stray from the path. I shall finish what I started.   
   
**Nero:**   
Thank you, Fujimaru. I feel like my eyes are wide open now.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm back, Senpai.... Oh, Nero?   
   
**Nero:**   
Umu, hey there Mash! If you're back, it's about time to finish this!   
   
**Mash:**   
???  
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like you've cheered up...Senpai, Nero looks brighter now, right?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She's the same as usual.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yeah, that's true. That might just be true.   
   
**Mash:**   
I think she's a lot like the sun. That's why she's captured the hearts of many.   
   
**Mash:**   
Even now, people are fighting under her name. She's got a powerful charisma.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's just who she is...Even if it dims a little, her light still shines true.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I cheered her up a little.   
   
**Mash:**   
All because of that?   
   
**Mash:**   
I see...So that's what I should have done.   
   
**Mash:**   
I couldn't do anything for her. Master, you're amazing.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Boo. What are you talking about? I want in on it too.   
   
**Nero:**   
At least that's what I want to say. Right now, I'll just have to wait, for now we assault the palace!   
   
**Nero:**   
Jing Ke has found a way in. We will take a small number of elites, and take out Romulus.   
   
**Nero:**   
This will be the last battle. Will you come with me Mash, Fujimaru?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Of course!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We have unfinished business in there, too.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Umu! Let's go, then!   
   
## Section 14: The Emperor   
   
**Nero:**   
Are you sure this is the way, Jing Ke?   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
This is the second time I've gone to the emperor. Don't worry, I promise I'll guide you to the throne without fail.   
   
**Nero:**   
The city sure looks familiar...It's impressive,they even replicated the palace down to the interiors.   
   
**Nero:**   
When did they build it? Is this some sort of spell?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's possible. It might have been the power of the Holy Grail.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
There's no time to chit chat. The enemy's noticed us&ndash;They're not human.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Nor are they Servants. They're probably monsters created by magecraft.   
   
**Nero:**   
Ugh, monsters huh? Whatever they may be, I am no longer afraid!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, it's enemy lifeforms...Commencing battle.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Romulus:**   
...Here you are, my beloved child.   
   
**Nero:**   
Umu, I am here! O proud founder of our great nation, King Romulus!   
   
**Romulus:**   
...Splendid radiance. In that case, should I call out your name, "Emperor? "  
   
**Nero:**   
Oh, there's no need. Call me what you did just now&ndash;  
   
**Nero:**   
Whether it's the past, the present, or the future. I am the one and only Fifth Emperor of the Roman Empire!   
   
**Nero:**   
Holy Progenitor, O King Romulus! I hereby challenge you with my warriors, my swords!   
   
**Romulus:**   
I'll allow it, Nero Claudius. Show me you can trample over Rome's love with your love.   
   
**Romulus:**   
Behold. My spear&ndash;  
   
**Romulus:**   
&ndash;"Rome" is here!   
   
**Mash:**   
An enemy Servant is approaching. Speculated class is Lancer. Battle commencing. Master, your orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Romulus:**   
...Your love, is so dazzling, Nero.   
   
**Romulus:**   
My eternal crimson and gold empire. I entrust it all to you and your heirs.   
   
**Romulus:**   
Don't forget. Rome is eternal.   
   
**Romulus:**   
Therefore, the world must always be eternal. Remember that...  
   
**Mash:**   
We've defeated the enemy Servant, Lancer Romulus. Victory is ours.   
   
**Nero:**   
We won? In that case...  
   
**Nero:**   
...Umu. Rome shall be restored to its former glory.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's true, more or less, but we still haven't found that Court Mage. We've got to search for the Holy Grail.   
   
**Nero:**   
Hmm? But the United Empire has already met its end. Isn't that right, Unseen Mage?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's certainly true, give or take. But unless we secure the Holy Grail, our purpose will be&ndash;  
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Wait, someone's there. Though it's not a Servant.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Lev:**   
...Well, well. To think you took out Romulus.   
   
**Lev:**   
Nice work for a "mere" Demi-Servant. Have you become more powerful since I last saw you at Fuyuki?   
   
**Lev:**   
However, a Servant is still a Servant. Sorry,but you'll never surpass the power of the Holy Grail.   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Nero:**   
Is that the Court Mage? Then that golden chalice he has is&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, that's the Holy Grail. It looks similar in shape to the one we saw before...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Who could've thought a Court Mage would ignore his king's crisis. I guess betrayal is second nature to you now, Professor Lev?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Actually, perhaps this is the real you? You seem more energetic than when you were at Chaldea.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Save the small talk for later!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hand over the Holy Grail!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Lev:**   
I see. Looks like you've learned to talk back, [♂ boy /♀ girl].   
   
**Lev:**   
I hear you did quite a bit in France. Thanks to that&mdash; I really got yelled at!   
   
**Lev:**   
I would've been back at the Temple already, but I got sent back out!   
   
**Lev:**   
As a result, I am here to do some clean-up.   
   
**Lev:**   
My plan was to give the Grail to a fitting fool,then enjoy what would unfold. But you ruined that.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I see. Find a human, or a Heroic Spirit who wants to plunge an era into madness.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Then if you give them the Grail, that era would surely drive itself into madness.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's what happened in France, but this time&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, the Holy Progenitor Romulus, did not wish for the downfall of mankind. That's why&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You have no other choice but to interfere yourself.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's quite ironic, Professor Lev. In this era,the only betrayer of mankind is you.   
   
**Lev:**   
Shut it trash. I never had any hope for humans in the first place.   
   
**Lev:**   
You either, Fujimaru.   
   
**Lev:**   
You think you can stop me, Lev Lainur,just because you defeated a few Servants?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's not going to go like before!   
   
**Lev:**   
It's true you've changed. You've grown quite a bit.   
   
**Lev:**   
You've grown more stupid that is! Don't you know that if you try to resist, you're going to suffer that much more?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are you after?   
   
**Lev:**   
I believe I told you, I already long completed my objective. This is what you should be asking, Fujimaru.   
   
**Lev:**   
"Why did you destroy humanity? "   
   
**Lev:**   
Although, even if you did ask me, I have no reason to answer you.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Lev:**   
Besides, I think you people misunderstand something. Recover the Grail, repair the Singularity,protect mankind&mdash;  
   
**Lev:**   
Protect humanity? &mdash;Idiots. There's nothing you can do.   
   
**Lev:**   
There's no point in struggling. The end is certain. You're insignificant, worthless!   
   
**Lev:**   
You will perish in sorrow! Allow me to show you the favor of our King!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Fooou!   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Nero:**   
What's that creature! It's ugly! You're uglier than anything of this world!   
   
**Lev:**   
Haha! Hahahaha! That's right! That ugliness will be your undoing!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...This signature, this amount of magical energy...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's not a Servant, not even a Phantasmal! Could that be&mdash;could that be an actual "Demon" from legends?   
   
**Lev:**   
Allow me to introduce myself again. I am Lev Lainur "Flauros! "  
   
**Lev:**   
One of the Seventy-Two Demon Gods! The Demon God Flauros&ndash; This is the true favor of our King!   
   
**Nero:**   
How disgusting...You are the reincarnation of evil!   
   
**Mash:**   
A giant pillar of flesh protruding out of the ground? A large amount of magical energy...Doctor!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Flauros. He did say Seventy-Two Demon Gods. In that case, the King he speaks of is&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, there's still not enough information. That's impossible, Demon Gods do not exist!   
   
**Fou:**   
...Fou! Kyu, kyu, kyu, kya!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We don't know the details, but that thing is dangerous. Here it comes! We've got to take it out!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...We've defeated the enemy lifeform Master!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All right!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't let your guard down!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right!   
   
**Lev:**   
...Impossible...  
   
**Lev:**   
A mere Heroic Spirit...Do you really think you can repel one of the "Gods? "  
   
**Lev:**   
No, this is simple miscalculation. That's right, that must be it.   
   
**Lev:**   
It's been too long since I left the Temple. My cells are starting to die off.   
   
**Lev:**   
But, I am  entrusted with the mission to incinerate the future. It's not as if I didn't have a contingency plan.   
   
**Mash:**   
Is something else coming?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Watch out! I'm detecting the Holy Grail's activation! Mash and Fujimaru, Something's about to happen!   
   
**Lev:**   
...By sacrificing ancient Rome,I have managed to summon the strongest hero.   
   
**Lev:**   
Rejoice, Emperor Nero Claudius. This one is truly fit to bring the demise of Rome.   
   
**Nero:**   
Rome is the world, and the world shall never come to an end!   
   
**Lev:**   
Even pride is nothing more than ultimate stupidity if misdirected, huh? See with your own eyes, the end of your world!   
   
**Lev:**   
We'll pull the bottom out on humanity! We'll destroy one of its seven foundations!   
   
**Lev:**   
&ndash;By the esteemed words of our King!   
   
**Lev:**   
Come forth! Great hero of destruction, Altera!   
   
**Altera:**   
&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Lev:**   
Kill. Destroy. Incinerate. With your power,burn Rome and this Singularity to the ground!   
   
**Lev:**   
Hahaha! It's over, Romani Archaman! Your dream of continuing Humanity is nothing but a dream!   
   
**Lev:**   
This Servant is the ultimate destroyer! Altera is a Heroic Spirit, but her power&ndash;  
   
**Altera:**   
&ndash;Silence.   
   
**Lev:**   
Huh?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What? Lev Lainur's signature has disappeared!   
   
**Mash:**   
He...He was cut in half by the Servant he summoned! Her True Name is Altera. She's probably a Saber.   
   
**Mash:**   
Altera has the Grail! It's being absorbed...huh? She's absorbing it...  
   
**Altera:**   
I am&ndash;  
   
**Altera:**   
A warrior of the Hun.   
   
**Altera:**   
And, its King.   
   
**Altera:**   
I am the King of Destruction, the one who destroyed the western world.   
   
**Altera:**   
Destruction&ndash;  
   
**Nero:**   
I've got a bad...feeling about this! Mash, something's going to happen. Even I can tell!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huge spike in her magical energy signature! This must be her Noble Phantasm&ndash;an Anti-Fortress level at that!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Deploy your Noble Phantasm, hurry!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Right!   
   
**Altera:**   
This is what you people said.   
   
**Altera:**   
That I am the divine punishment itself.   
   
**Altera:**   
&ndash;The Scourge of God.   
   
## Section 15: Scourge of God   
   
**Nero:**   
...I thought I was going to die.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Right. With the release of an Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm so close, I'm amazed that you're not dead.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Thank you, Mash. You too, Boudica. That was great timing.   
   
**Boudica:**   
...To be honest, that was too close.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I ran in to raid the palace from the entrance, only to sense this vast amount of magical energy, so I rushed to release my Noble Phantasm's True Name as well.   
   
**Mash:**   
I couldn't have blocked that with my Noble Phantasm alone. Thank you, Boudica.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Likewise. But, what are we going to do now.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Lu Bu and Spartacus were rampaging around the palace entrance and unfortunately got hit by that light.   
   
**Boudica:**   
We can't count on them any more. We've gotten this far...  
   
**Nero:**   
Altera was the name, right? She&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Already started her advance from the Untied Empire's capital. Judging from the direction, she's heading for Rome.   
   
**Nero:**   
In that case, is she planning to burn my capital to ash?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'd imagine so. Plus, she has that ability.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even if you're left alive, with the capital destroyed, Rome will disappear as well.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Or she might come to kill you after she destroys the capital.   
   
**Nero:**   
Either option is rejected. I have no intention of allowing Rome or myself to fall.   
   
**Mash:**   
Then we have to defeat Altera. But can we...even stand up to her?   
   
**Mash:**   
Her magical energy is tremendous. It reminded me of the sacred sword in Fuyuki...  
   
**Mash:**   
And we had a powerful Caster helping us back then. Now...  
   
**Nero:**   
You can't do it, Mash?   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Nero:**   
I would like to think otherwise. Fujimaru and Mash have saved me multiple times.   
   
**Nero:**   
You were talking about gods and the like, I'm certain the gods and fate are on our side.   
   
**Nero:**   
That's why Fujimaru and the rest of you came here. My wish shall see its fruition.   
   
**Nero:**   
Rome will be saved. My people and my Rome will be left for future generations. I'm sure of it.   
   
**Nero:**   
The Holy Progenitor said so as well. I heard it.   
   
**Nero:**   
The world must be eternal. Rome must continue on eternally.   
   
**Nero:**   
Even if its name will someday be forgotten, the many seeds Rome planted will continue on in different forms.   
   
**Nero:**   
The eternal empire will continue to exist. Even if its emperor, state, and name changes.   
   
**Nero:**   
It is the innate truth that mankind will continue to thrive. The tree of life that is humanity.   
   
**Nero:**   
&mdash;Fujimaru. I am sure that is the "Humanity" you are trying to protect.   
   
**Boudica:**   
...Emperor Nero. I don't understand what you're trying to say.   
   
**Nero:**   
I see. Honestly, I don't either.   
   
**Mash:**   
I understood it a little. At least I think I did.   
   
**Mash:**   
Even if something's clear and defined fades, as long as the world exists, its memes will remain.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
How about thinking more romantically? Nero's words gave me strength.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
She's confident that we can fight Altera. That's why the world won't end.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sounds good to me. Although there's no real basis for it&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But it makes you feel like we should at least try. Fujimaru, what do you think?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
&ndash;Let's put our faith in Nero.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Got it. Then I will put my faith in your words Senpai.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I'll join in, too. I'm tired of things getting destroyed.   
   
**Boudica:**   
I hate that one called Altera far more than Emperor Nero.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
I don't really get what's going on, but I think it's safe to believe in Nero Claudius's luck.   
   
**Nero:**   
Oh, hey there Jing Ke, where did you disappear off to?   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
I was observing&ndash;Altera. It looks like she's slowly advancing.   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
We can catch up if we leave now. That is, if you all want to.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We just came to a conclusion on that. Nice timing, there.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well then everyone, time to head out! Let's get the Grail back and save the world!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...At least that was the plan until a second ago. I am picking up a major magical energy signature.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It must've be drawn to the power of the Grail when it connected with Altera&ndash;Phantasmals, it's the wyverns!   
   
**Nero:**   
Wyvern? What's that? A monster out of a fairy tale?   
   
**Mash:**   
No, it's a dangerous enemy! Master, your orders please!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Now I'm picking up multiple magical energy signatures. Is she attracting monsters just by walking?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Is she summoning them? I don't know the details, but they're closing in fast!   
   
**Nero:**   
Wyverns again? I never thought I'd be fighting dragons.   
   
**Mash:**   
We're used to it. Lord Nero, Senpai and I will take the front!   
   
**Nero:**   
So reliable! Umu, I'm leaving it to you!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I really want to say "good work," but more are coming. Several times more than before&ndash;  
   
**Nero:**   
Wh-What? Several times? That's pretty wild.   
   
**Boudica:**   
...Guess it can't be helped. We'll take those on, Jing Ke are you ready?   
   
**Jing Ke:**   
Monsters aren't my specialty. But I should take on non-human enemies for a change.   
   
**Nero:**   
W-Wait, Boudica, Jing Ke, what do you mean take them on? You're coming with us.   
   
**Boudica:**   
Exactly. You go on ahead already.   
   
**Nero:**   
What are you saying&ndash;  
   
**F：???:**  
GuOOOOOO&ndash;!!!!!   
   
**Boudica:**   
Go! You stupid emperor! Never mind this,go protect what you call your world!   
   
**Nero:**   
...Apologies. My worthy rival, Queen of Britannia.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's right everyone. No time to look back,we're close to where Altera is&ndash;  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Altera:**   
...Are you going to stand in my way?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's why we're here.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I can't let you advance any further.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero:**   
Yes, I'll stand in your way. I can't allow you advance further, no matter what.   
   
**Nero:**   
You said that you would destroy the world.   
   
**Nero:**   
I don't understand. Why would you say that you were going to destroy the world?   
   
**Nero:**   
The world is brimming with beauty. Flowers, songs, gold, love...  
   
**Nero:**   
That's right, above all, this Rome, this world is filled with my love.   
   
**Nero:**   
And you'd destroy it? Don't you find that wasteful Altera, or whoever you are?   
   
**Altera:**   
I am&ndash;  
   
**Altera:**   
A warrior of the Hun.   
   
**Altera:**   
And its King.   
   
**Altera:**   
A King of Destruction, who will bring destruction to the western world.   
   
**Nero:**   
That again?   
   
**Nero:**   
How sad Altera, but even that sadness seems beautiful to me.   
   
**Nero:**   
I can't just leave you like this. I feel a great pain and contradiction in your life.   
   
**Nero:**   
Perhaps your power exceeds mine, but know that you cannot defeat me in love.   
   
**Altera:**   
I know not of love, I know not of beauty.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, those words are different from before. It seems like she's not responding automatically.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This reaction&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see, she's going out of control by becoming one with the Grail! This isn't good, talking is not going to end this.    
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Magical energy signature rising. You have to stop her before she unleashes it again.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is the last battle for Rome&ndash;Mash, Fujimaru!   
   
**Mash:**   
Prepare for anti-Servant combat! Master, your orders!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Altera:**   
...I see.   
   
**Altera:**   
In this world...There are things that cannot be destroyed, even...by my sword.   
   
**Altera:**   
I was called, the Scourge of God...  
   
**Altera:**   
Even my...  
   
**Altera:**   
Sword of Mars...can't...I see...  
   
**Altera:**   
Well that...  
   
**Altera:**   
Makes me...a little happy...  
   
**Nero:**   
Altera is gone. Perhaps fate will arrange for us to battle again one day.   
   
**Nero:**   
But...is it over? Have you obtained that Holy Grail&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, we've obtained the Holy Grail. This concludes our mission.   
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you very much, Nero Claudius.   
   
**Nero:**   
Mash, your toes are looking faint! Don't tell me you're going to vanish too!   
   
**Nero:**   
Fujimaru, Fou...I see, you're all going to vanish...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Farewell.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We must go now.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Nero:**   
...I had a feeling. My intuition is pretty sharp, you see.   
   
**Nero:**   
You're going to disappear like Altera,my uncle, and the Holy Progenitor.   
   
**Nero:**   
Boudica, will you, as well? Jing Ke, Lu Bu, Spartacus?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes.   
   
**Mash:**   
This era will be restored. Your memories of fighting the United Empire will no longer exist.   
   
**Nero:**   
That's a sad thing.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, it is...  
   
**Nero:**   
I will no longer doubt you. I believe you, but this is a problem.   
   
**Nero:**   
It's unfortunate, I haven't given you any reward.   
   
**Nero:**   
You could have been more than my retainers. Something more&ndash;  
   
**Nero:**   
No, no sense in saying it. Fujimaru,you will find yourself heading to Rome.   
   
**Nero:**   
All roads lead to Rome, for Rome is the world. Both the Holy Progenitor and I believe so.   
   
**Nero:**   
So I will not say goodbye. Only thanks.   
   
**Nero:**   
&ndash;Thank you. I offer you the thanks of my soul and a rose for your efforts!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Welcome back and good job you two. You retrieved the Grail.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Was that for the best?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
When?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I'll explain. The Grail is the law that decides how magical energies in a dimension is used.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Think of it as a world's rules. It normally doesn't have a form, but Lev crystallized it into one.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
We can't analyze its workings, but we can seal it away.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I fiddled with Mash's shield a little, and created a space for the Grail.   
   
**Mash:**   
My shield can do that?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yes. The best place for a relic is in a relic, I figure.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It can only hold one at a time, so I yank it out after each retrieval. Got it?   
   
**Mash:**   
Ahhh!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Ok, Grail's retrieval is confirmed~♪Try your best to search for the next one!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This is our second Grail and we've also achieved our original goal of finding Lev.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But Lev is&mdash;  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I didn't learn anything...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...That's right. Altera killed him,and we never found out what his plans were.   
   
**Mash:**   
...You mean why he betrayed mankind and tried to...destroy it?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's right. We still don't know anything,but still have five singularities left.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Lev spoke of "Gods. " In other words,there are other enemies out there just like him.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What that means at this point, we don't know.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All we can do is recover the Grails one by one, and restore the Singularities.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Leave the next Grail to me!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We've got a long way to go.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good answer. I'm counting on you, Fujimaru.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We don't have that much time, but for tonight try and rest well.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
You walked a long way. You'll want a good massage, I'm sure.   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You look down Mash.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Thinking about Nero?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Our parting with Nero was so sudden. I feel bad about leaving her...  
   
**Mash:**   
Even if it ended up never happening, in that last moment, she was alone.   
   
**Mash:**   
She defeated the people she respected, and said goodbye to her rivals&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
She was left all alone in that huge empire with no one to rely on.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Was this battle hard for you?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you think Nero feels lonely?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;No, I don't think so.... I'm sure that's not right.   
   
**Mash:**   
It was a hard battle, yes. We almost died many times, and I'm still scared of fighting.   
   
**Mash:**   
But&mdash;it was a fun journey.   
   
**Mash:**   
Partially thanks to Nero's glamour, but...It was a lot of fun.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm sure it was fun for Nero, too.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It was a fun Empire, just like Nero.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. I'll never forget that sky and land, I'm sure.   
   
**Mash:**   
By the way Senpai, about what the Doctor said.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What did Roman say?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
The massage?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, you need to take care of yourself. Shall I give you a massage?   
   
**Mash:**   
I know several effective methods shiatsu, deep tissue...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sounds good.   
   
**Mash:**   
Really?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll pass.   
   
**Mash:**   
Come on, please!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Ahem. I really wanted to try it.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, that's all. Um, well...  
   
**Mash:**   
I tried it once before, and they said it really hurt...Oh!   
   
**Mash:**   
T-That shouldn't happen anymore. I practiced after that. In my mind.   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? Senpai?   
   
**Mash:**   
Where are you going? Oh, you want a massage in your room, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai?
