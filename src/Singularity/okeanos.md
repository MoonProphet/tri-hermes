# Singularity 3: Sealed Ends of the Four Seas - Okeanos  
  
## Prelude  
   
**Pirate:**   
Cannon ready!   
   
**Drake:**   
All right, FIRE&mdash;!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Dammit, it's no good! Looks like it's not working after all!   
   
**Drake:**   
I can see that! We're fools to be taking them seriously!   
   
**Drake:**   
Hard to port! Time to make a run for it, men! Catch the breeze and flee!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Breeze?! Isn't this more like a storm?   
   
**Pirate:**   
If we put the sails up,our ship will be blown away!   
   
**Drake:**   
It's okay! Even pirates wanna fly sometimes!   
   
**Drake:**   
Now you'll have more lame stories for when we return to land! Maybe they'll finally work on the ladies!   
   
**Drake:**   
And returning from the skies? That's a tale any woman of wit will love!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Hah! Our Pelican's seriously getting some air now! Looks like the boss is out of control!   
   
**Drake:**   
What! Pelican? What the HELL did you just call my ship!?   
   
**Pirate:**   
The Hind! The Golden Hind, ma'am! My mistake!   
   
**Pirate:**   
All right! Hang tight, you little twerps!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Our boss' good luck is the real deal! Believe in her, and she'll get us out of this alive!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Once we're on land again, even swabbies will get to feast! Don't you go dyin' on me now!   
   
**Pirates:**   
AAAAHHH! After what we've seen,we'd follow you into the depths of hell, Captain!   
   
**Drake:**   
Don't be silly. I've got no use for dead people! A pirate's all about staying alive and sailing!   
   
**Drake:**   
Now, get to work you idiots! We'll win this war and return to drink ourselves silly!   
   
**Pirates:**   
OOOOOOH! Captain Drake, you're the best! I love being a pirate!   
   
**F：???:**  
...You managed to escape this massive whirlpool...And you aren't even a Heroic Spirit. Unbelievable...  
   
**F：???:**  
But&mdash;Heh heh, hahahahaha! That's what makes you Francis Drake! Your legend is true!   
   
**F：???:**  
Hahaha! HAHAHAHAH! AAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA LOLOLOLOLOL!   
  
**--SECTION BREAK--**  
   
**A：???:**  
&mdash;I woke up at the same time today.   
   
**A：???:**  
I checked my temperature. My five senses. To drive the point home, I said my name out loud.   
   
**A：???:**  
A deep breath&mdash;I confirmed my consciousness,as I was told it might disappear each time I fell asleep.   
   
**A：???:**  
I was myself. My existence had been approved one more day.   
   
**B：???:**  
Good morning, Number 2. Aren't you cold? The temperature outside is 70 below.   
   
**B：???:**  
It's especially cold this morning. Well, I suppose that's irrelevant as long as you're in this room.   
   
**A：???:**  
There in that clean, comfortable room,I said what came to my mind, "That's quite troublesome. "  
   
**B：???:**  
...Any inconveniences? If there's something you don't like, please let me know.   
   
**A：???:**  
He smiled as he told me that,and gave me a very pained look.   
   
**A：???:**  
I thought, perhaps, that part of his body was in pain. "Are you okay? " I asked him.   
   
**B：???:**  
...Yeah, I'm fine. Guess my worries were unwarranted. Good morning, ■■. Congrats on your 5,110th awakening.   
   
**A：???:**  
"Thank you very much," I responded. It was how I genuinely felt.   
   
**A：???:**  
I was extremely happy. For one more day,I'd get to enjoy the wonders of this world.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! (plod, plod, plod)Fou! FOU!! (plod, plod, plod, plod)  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oww, oww.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Stop, stop.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
N-No, Fou! You must not bite. You should use a gentler touch.   
   
**Mash:**   
Even if they are as dense as a rock. See, like a blade peeling a carrot.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Good morning, Mash.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm already awake, Mash.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...My. Non-REM sleep to fully awake in a single second...  
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning, and very impressive, Senpai. You're clearly enthusiastic about being entrusted with the Continuation of Humanity.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm serious about it too. Let's be optimistic and head to the control room!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good morning everyone, how did you all sleep? I didn't sleep much.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We defeated Lev Lainur and retrieved the second Holy Grail...That's great, but there are more questions.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What was that pillar of flesh? Who was that,claiming to be one of the 72 Demon Gods?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We unfortunately don't have the time or resources to analyze these questions.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, Dr. Roman. Speaking of the 72 Demon Gods, well...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, I can only think of one thing. The familiars who served a certain ancient king.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ancient king?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Familiars?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's right! The King of Ancient Israel,and the greatest summoner in the world of mages!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The familiars who served him were the infamous 72 Demon Gods!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh! Are you Da Vinci?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yes. Good. Perfect! Mash, I love your reaction!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It was worth slipping those cue cards to Roman! As a genius, my stage entries must be grand!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Sigh. Please don't tire me out so early in the morning, Da Vinci.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Also, please refrain from spreading rumors. None of this information is substantiated.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
To begin with, the 72 Demon Gods are all fantasies. Demon Gods don't actually exist.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
These days people speculate that they were merely familiars broken down into 72 different roles, right?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yeah. But since the roles were so clearly defined,some theorize that they may be the origin of angels.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And since he actually claimed to be one, it's not unrelated?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
How about the hypothesis that Lev, or the mastermind behind him, summoned "a certain ancient king? "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...That possibility does exist...Still, I find the idea of 72 Demon Gods hard to believe...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Why is that? I mean, Fujimaru actually fought one, right?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's why. The data I have seems to correspond with what I would expect from a "demon. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But, uh, how do I put this...It follows the legend too well. The concept of demons came much later than that king.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Suppose that king really did turn into a Heroic Spirit. His Noble Phantasm would be a lot simpler and smarter.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It would be strange to have such an ominous Demon God, one that modern-day people know of, serving under him.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm. You have a point. The chance that they're just assuming the name is high.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Now, if we could just ask Servants related to Demon Gods a few questions, it would make our lives infinitely easier.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. That's why, for now, I won't comment on the Demon God Lev transformed into. It's still anybody's guess.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Back on topic...Let's talk about obtaining the third Holy Grail.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This may seem sudden, but Fujimaru,did you get seasick back in Rome?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A little bit.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I see.... Right, of course.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Humans are creatures that have learned to adapt. I'm sure you'll be fine.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's not very reassuring, Doctor.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm fine.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Good! How reassuring. I was about to get motion sickness meds that "work" on the central nervous system, if need be.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
FOU!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh? Fou is going to head out again?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Hmm. I'm not superstitious, but when Fou's around Mash's mental state stabilizes...I'll be counting on you.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm sorry Doctor, but if Fou's nearby during a crisis, I just feel so much calmer...  
   
**Fou:**   
N'kyu.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
New land always awaits us with each Rayshift. The more we find familiar, the better. Take him with you.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The year is 1573. The location&mdash; An ocean as far as the eye can see!   
   
**Mash:**   
Ocean, you say?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Right. The geography is shifting correspondingly with the Singularity.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It doesn't look like there's an area that can be specifically marked "here. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The sea only has several islands scattered around. I would like you to investigate the cause of the Singularity immediately.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I hope we don't end up in the ocean...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There's no need to worry about that. We'll input the necessary coordinates for the Rayshift.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
At the very least, you shouldn't end up in the ocean. Besides, you have another promising ally with you.   
   
**Mash:**   
Ally?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Here, I invented it. It's a rubber floaty. You can use it in case you get into trouble.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Sigh.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Roger that.   
   
**Mash:**   
Umm...It would be quite troublesome if we landed in the middle of the ocean right after being teleported.   
   
**Mash:**   
I don't know how to swim. Senpai...You're not a great swimmer either, are you?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Don't worry, I've taken that into consideration for the purposes of the Rayshift.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
At least you won't end up in the walls somewhere. In case you do end up in the ocean&ndash;  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Here, a floaty! Cool, isn't it? I took the liberty of designing it in Decalavian style.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hahaha. This is needlessly prickly! Fitting the ocean theme, it's like a starfish!   
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Dr. Roman? This is putting Senpai's safety on the line, right?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Sorry. It was just a little joke before departure. I shall tend to the Rayshift at all costs.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Hmm. I still have some worries,but we don't have the time to address all of them.   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, let's go. I will give it everything I have.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah, let's do it, Mash!   
   
**Mash:**   
Of course. Leave the combat to me once we arrive.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I have a couple of errands...  
   
**Mash:**   
Leave the errands till after we've returned to Chaldea. Now, let's go.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hahaha. Mash has really started to take charge. Fujimaru is the type that gets henpecked, too.   
   
**Mash:**   
???  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're coming after all.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll carry you.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
N'kyu!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Looks like you're all set. Now, let's start the search for the third Holy Grail!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Announcement A:**   
Unsummon Program, start.  Spiritron Conversion, start.   
   
**Announcement A:**   
Counting down to Rayshift. 3, 2, 1...  
   
**Announcement A:**   
All procedures cleared. Grand Order, commencing operation.   
   
## Section 1: Pirates of Chaldea   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hey, Mash...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...True, we never did Rayshift to the ocean before.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yes, but Mash...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai. I know exactly what you're trying to say.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Dr. Roman. If you have any excuses, let's hear them.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well...Uh...Murphy's Law, was it?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
When there's a chance of failure,you're sure to be guided towards that failure?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Also...When you think about it...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It is completely possible to be Rayshifted onto a deserted island and wait a full 28 years before help arrives, right?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Then wouldn't you say it's rather beneficial to have transport immediately available?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Pirate:**   
Not really sure what's going on, but...Get 'em, fellas!   
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;Seems like Dr. Roman needs to be disciplined after all!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry, I promise I meant well!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Pirate:**   
Sorry about that...  
   
**Mash:**   
...Whew. I don't like to get rough, but with the situation as it is, I have no choice but to interrogate you...Forcefully.   
   
**Mash:**   
Who are you, where is this ocean, and what's going on? Would you care to explain?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Hey, we have no clue either, see. Before we knew it, we were afloat around here.   
   
**Pirate:**   
Our compasses and maps are completely useless, too.   
   
**Pirate:**   
When you've got no clue what's going on, see, you just attack the prey in front of you, right? It's the pirate's way.   
   
**Mash:**   
What? So you had no idea who we were...  
   
**Mash:**   
And you didn't know if it's safe to do so,yet you still attacked us?   
   
**Pirate:**   
♪That's right, yo ho♪♪Because we're pirates♪  
   
**Mash:**   
...What should we do, Senpai? He's started to sing like he's in a musical...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is he an idiot?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't we have other leads?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
I may be an idiot, but I do have some leads. Word has it, there's a Pirate Island nearby.   
   
**Pirate:**   
We're running low on food and water. I say it's a good idea to try the island...  
   
**Mash:**   
Pirate...Island? Um, are there lots of pirates there?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Yeah, it IS Pirate Island.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmmm.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...For now, we don't have any leads that feel like leads. We might as well go there.   
   
**Mash:**   
Understood...Well, everyone, I hereby exercise my rights as victor.   
   
**Mash:**   
Please, man the wheel. Head towards this Pirate Island.   
   
**Pirate:**   
Aye, aye, sir!   
   
**Mash:**   
That would be, "Aye, aye, ma'am! "  
   
## Section 2: Pioneering Pirate Queen   
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like this is Pirate Island...  
   
**Pirate:**   
Woo-hoo! Women! Prey! Hunting! Looks like fun!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Looks like pirates are just as enthusiastic on land. I'm taking them out!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...All right, next please.   
   
**Pirate:**   
Hey, gimme a break. I didn't mean any harm...  
   
**Pirate:**   
It was my instinct as a pirate...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wh-What a poor excuse for a pirate!   
   
**Mash:**   
Does anyone on this island have a grasp of the situation?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Oh...That would be Boss, I guess.   
   
**Mash:**   
Who's Boss?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Heh heh heh, listen and be amazed...Francis Drake,the greatest, most glorious pirate on the high seas!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Why this swagger all of a sudden?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm. Perhaps it's a desperate attempt to seem more"pirate" like. That's what I think.   
   
**Pirate:**   
After we get through the forest, you'll find the Great Pirate Francis Drake's secret hideout.   
   
**Pirate:**   
Heh heh heh...You guys are done for. When Boss gets a hold of you, you'll be...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Why does this person keep talking like a grunt?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Setting up one's character is important in any era. It's even normal to recreate your body into a beautiful idol.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry Da Vinci, but can you just go back to your workshop?   
   
**Pirate:**   
What's with all the ruckus? Is it magic? Magic or something!?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.   
   
**Pirate:**   
Oh my, what is this adorable little creature. It looks delicious.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Eat him and I'll beat you till you cry.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Eat him and I'll crush you till you cry.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Pirate:**   
Yes, sorry!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, we need to press onward.   
   
**Mash:**   
Francis Drake. One of the great heroes that pioneered this world.   
   
**Mash:**   
We are in the midst of the Age of Exploration&mdash;If he's the real Drake, he's probably a living being.   
   
**Mash:**   
He's the first voyager in history to sail around the globe and live to tell the tale.   
   
**Mash:**   
England received great fortune from his actions. They bested Spain, who had been dominating the world seas.   
   
**Mash:**   
Spain was once touted as The Sun That Never Sets. But even Spaniards feared him, the "El Draque"...  
   
**Mash:**   
Truly the "Hero Who Brought Down the Sun. " The prosperity of the British Empire wouldn't be possible without Captain Drake.   
   
**Mash:**   
Though Drake was officially sanctioned by the state as a corsair...A pirate is still a pirate.   
   
**Mash:**   
Judging from the behavior of pirates we've met so far,odds are high that he's a good-for-nothing thug.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't let your guard down.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Roman's just as good-for-nothing.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, that is correct.   
   
**Mash:**   
Most likely a gluttonous giant, a nefarious character able to grab a barrel in one hand and chug its contents.   
   
**Mash:**   
...It is quite disturbing, but there is no doubt he is a key person of this era.   
   
**Mash:**   
We must somehow get the help of Francis Drake.   
   
**Pirate:**   
Boss! BOSS! We've got enem...err, guests, I mean!   
   
**Pirate:**   
They said they wish to speak with you, Boss!   
   
**Drake:**   
The hell? Geez, right when I'm in a good mood from this good rum&ndash;  
   
**Drake:**   
Guests? Are they pirates?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Umm, I don't think so! They seem a bit classier than us, and a bit more violent!   
   
**Mash:**   
...A bit?   
   
**Drake:**   
The hell is that? Well then, government? Or army?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Uhh, I don't think they're any of those.   
   
**Drake:**   
So you don't know...Fine, bring them in!   
   
**Mash:**   
If you'll excuse me.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Drake:**   
...Well now,you certainly brought me some strange ones, Bombe.   
   
**Pirate:**   
Yeah. But they've got their good points.   
   
**Pirate:**   
Not only did they save our lives,but they're excited to meet their idol captain.   
   
**Drake:**   
Idol. I'm their idol? Really?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Yeah. They've been saying how great you are,how Drake can blast away the Spanish Armada in an instant!   
   
**Pirate:**   
That Drake's a giant over 3 meters tall who downs rum by the barrel. They're really excited!   
   
**Drake:**   
Whaaat? What's up with that? I haven't committed such sins yet!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, Senpai. I'm so stunned I can't speak. (whispering)  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Me too. Who knew that THE Francis Drake was&mdash; (whispering)  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who knew she was a woman!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yeah, who knew she was a beautiful lady!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Drake:**   
Stand aside, Bombe. I'll do the talking.   
   
**Drake:**   
So? Who on earth are you? Looks like you took good care of my boys.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're from the Organization.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're from Chaldea.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
You must be Francis Drake.   
   
**Mash:**   
My name is Mash Kyrielite. I'm part of the Chaldea Security Organization.   
   
**Mash:**   
This is my Master&ndash;Fujimaru.   
   
**Drake:**   
Chaldea? What do the "stargazers" want with us? Are they here to sell us some new maps of constellations?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wha-? This drunk actually knows her stuff! Even the origins of Chaldea!   
   
**Drake:**   
...Something feels really shallow about you, sir.   
   
**Drake:**   
Cowardly, gutless, pessimistic...A good man,but a chicken. I hate people like you the most.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Perfect. Senpai, her analysis...I mean instinct, is perfect!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Shucks...  
   
**Drake:**   
Well, spare me the details. They're just a pain in the ass. So, what does Chaldea want with me anyway?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Right, we were sent to fix all the anomalies in this era.   
   
**Drake:**   
...Okay.   
   
**Mash:**   
Captain Francis Drake. Since you're so great, you've probably already noticed.   
   
**Mash:**   
Something is wrong with this era, with this world.   
   
**Mash:**   
The ocean you've spent your days in,and the ocean we see before us, are not the same.   
   
**Drake:**   
...Heh, all this talk about the world, the era,they were things I decided to completely ignore...  
   
**Drake:**   
...But I can't ignore talk about the ocean. You're right, something did feel strange.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I thought so! We can explain why&mdash;  
   
**Drake:**   
&mdash;But when I say "strange," I don't mean it as a bad thing. There's no other world that's as fun as this one!   
   
**Drake:**   
Isn't that right, you scumbags?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Woo-hoo! You bet! You're the best, Boss! Hear, hear, to never-ending rum!   
   
**Mash:**   
Whaaaaaaaat?   
   
**Drake:**   
You see? We pirates long for freedom,even if it entails evil deeds!   
   
**Drake:**   
If you insist on speaking with me...You must pass some tests first.   
   
**Drake:**   
Try to defeat me, THE Francis Drake. Then we can talk!   
   
**Drake:**   
I'm as drunk as they come right now! Let's see if you have what it takes to sober me up!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I guess too much freedom is sometimes a bad thing. Like in France, please use the back of the blade!   
   
**Mash:**   
O-Of course! I shall respond to Captain Drake's request. Master!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay, let's do this!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
S-So powerful...This person is flesh and blood, right?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
W-Well, she should be. Thing is, I'm getting a magical energy reading from her.   
   
**Mash:**   
So she's either a mage&ndash;or a hero from birth?   
   
**Drake:**   
Ahhhh! That hits the spot. Rum's got nothing on this, I'm telling you.   
   
**Pirate:**   
Hey Boss! You all right?   
   
**Drake:**   
Hahaha! What are you talking about? Of course I'm all right!   
   
**Drake:**   
That aside though...Seems that I lost.   
   
**Drake:**   
You can boil me, fry me, sleep with me,anything you want!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll pass.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm good.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master, I don't think you need to reply every time...  
   
**Drake:**   
Oh? I see, I see. In that case, I guess it can't be helped.   
   
**Drake:**   
Anyway, a loss is a loss,I'll hear you guys out.   
   
**Drake:**   
But, you know what? From the looks of it, you want a ride, don't you?   
   
**Drake:**   
You're looking for something, but are unfamiliar with these seas. That's why you need to rely on me, pirate or not.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You being a pirate is irrelevant.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We need you, Francis Drake.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Drake:**   
I see.... Hmm, hah, so that's it.   
   
**Drake:**   
So? What exactly do you want from us? We lost, so we'll give you anything other than our lives.   
   
**Mash:**   
...First, we must understand the situation. "Where" exactly are we?   
   
**Mash:**   
England? Or closer to Spain, perhaps? Or are we in the Caribbean?   
   
**Drake:**   
Uhh, sorry. Come to think of it, we don't know either.   
   
**Mash:**   
So all that revelry and you don't even know!?   
   
**Drake:**   
Right, because there's no shortage of food or booze.   
   
**Drake:**   
All right. Now that we've surrendered to you,we're officially part of your crew!   
   
**Drake:**   
How about we start off with a toast!   
   
**Mash:**   
H-Hey, wait a sec...  
   
**Drake:**   
C'mooon, it's fine, it's all good.   
   
**Mash:**   
It's NOT good! Hey, what are you...No, wait! Master, save me!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Hm? What are these readings...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's up?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Nah, must be an error. I'll make some adjustments.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Drake:**   
All right, men! To our two new comrades, Fujimaru and Mash.   
   
**Drake:**   
Huh? That's backwards. To their new comrades, us&ndash;  
   
**Drake:**   
Cheers!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Cheers!   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, but we really don't have time for this...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It can't be helped.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There's nothing we can do.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Please don't give in so easily! We have to set sail and check out these waters immediately...  
   
**Drake:**   
What's with the gloomy look? You'll never find treasure with an attitude like that!   
   
**Mash:**   
That's not what I mean. If you're going to help, please consider our situation&ndash;  
   
**Drake:**   
Huh? Oh, I get it, more or less. These waters are abnormal, right?   
   
**Drake:**   
I mean, I've seen superhumans walking around who won't even budge from cannon fire.   
   
**Mash:**   
Servants!   
   
**Drake:**   
Being a pirate myself, see,I've been through my share of chaos.   
   
**Drake:**   
I can usually tell when it's something bad and unavoidable.   
   
**Drake:**   
These waters are abnormal. One moment we're in a jungle, the next we're in a temperate Mediterranean climate&ndash;  
   
**Drake:**   
The currents and winds are a mess, too. I mean, even sailing straight out into the sea is tricky.   
   
**Drake:**   
...Moreover, there's no "continent" in this ocean. Nor is there an "England. "  
   
**Mash:**   
So, you already knew that much...  
   
**Drake:**   
Hence why we were already planning on a new journey as soon as tomorrow.   
   
**Drake:**   
Doesn't make sense for pirates to settle down on land. Gotta find a town to call our home base.   
   
**Drake:**   
Tonight was supposed to be the pre-party. But, you guys showed up out of nowhere.   
   
**Mash:**   
I see...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry for interfering.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Pardon us.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Drake:**   
Don't sweat it. You guys are a good omen!   
   
**Drake:**   
From what I can tell,you know how to handle a cannon or two. Right?   
   
**Mash:**   
I've never tried, but probably.... Um, so if you already knew this much, why did you attack us?   
   
**Drake:**   
Ahahaha! Well, isn't that obvious? Because it seemed like fun!   
   
**Mash:**   
Such a trivial reason...  
   
**Drake:**   
So, Fujimaru you say? You the&ndash;captain or something?   
   
**Mash:**   
Something similar, I would say.   
   
**Drake:**   
Heh heh heh. In that case&ndash;Drink up!   
   
**Drake:**   
Let's be friends. From one captain to another, eh?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!? Fofou? FOOOOOOOOOU!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Huh?   
   
**Drake:**   
Now, someone knows how to hold their liquor.   
   
**Mash:**   
U-Umm...Senpai?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What is it, Mash?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
The H-Holy Grail...  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I know.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, the Holy Grail&ndash;!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll get it.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
No, that's not what I mean. The Holy Grail...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
For everyone who fought with us!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Um, okay.... That's not what I mean, Senpai!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's do our best, Mash!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash :**   
Senpai, how many fingers am I holding up?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see two Mashes, so...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash :**   
Get ahold of yourself! Senpai! Right in front of you! The Holy Grail! It's here!   
   
**Drake:**   
Why're you staring at me all of a sudden? You see someone you recognize?   
   
**Mash:**   
That's not it at all! That thing! What the captain has in her hands!   
   
**Drake:**   
Ah-ha! You got a fine pair of eyes there. Gold tankards are usually so tasteless, but not this one.   
   
**Drake:**   
It's not just the never-ending booze from it, either.   
   
**Drake:**   
Place it on the table, and behold! It produces endless meat and fish!   
   
**Drake:**   
I just happened to pick it up,but I doubt you'll find anything like this anywhere.   
   
**Pirate:**   
What're you talking about, Boss? This wasn't coincidence. It was an adventure for several lifetimes!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Seven endless nights! Giant destructive whirlpools in one ocean after another!   
   
**Pirate:**   
And from within the maelstrom,the legendary lost city of Atlantis!   
   
**Pirate:**   
"The time is upon us. By the 12 gods of Olympus, I shall create another flood and destroy all civilization! "  
   
**Pirate:**   
That's what the big thing said right before Boss kicked its ass and seized the treasure!   
   
**Pirate:**   
And with that, as crazy as it sounds,she became a hero! She saved the world!   
   
**Drake:**   
Huh? Was it really that epic? It got on my nerves, so I gave it a piece of my mind.   
   
**Drake:**   
That big lug called itself Poseidon. Can't really have that as a sailor.   
   
**Drake:**   
That's why I put it in check and took its treasure, see? I even sank the entire city into the whirlpool. It was great!   
   
**G：Pirate:**   
Bwaaaahahaha! Way to go, Boss! Both fortune and misfortune smiled upon you!   
   
**G：Pirate:**   
You're gonna be single till the day you die! Or maybe you're actually a dude or something, eh Boss?   
   
**Drake:**   
Now this is fun! We've got a new crew, and the booze is tasty! But we're takin' Bombe in a barrel later, and sinkin' him!   
   
**Drake:**   
Now we sing, you idiots! Golden Hind, sing the crew's theme song!   
   
**Drake & Pirates:**   
♪Reap our treasure! ♪♪Down our ale! ♪  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...FOOOOOOOU!   
   
**Mash:**   
Ahhh...Aahhh...I don't believe it...They're not lying!   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, the Foundation of Humanity was on the verge of destruction in this era before we arrived!   
   
**Mash:**   
And...Captain Drake, without even knowing,resolved it on a whim.   
   
**Mash:**   
And the result&mdash;  
   
**Drake:**   
Whoa, it's sinking into my body. I never get used to this, really.   
   
**Drake:**   
With this treasure,I can even deal damage to those invincible guys.   
   
**Drake:**   
But it goes in and out of my body. Makes my chest so tight, I can't stand it.   
   
**Mash:**   
That Holy Grail! Captain Drake is the owner of this era's Holy Grail&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
No, by saving this era, the Holy Grail chose her. She is truly the rightful owner of the Grail!   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor! Doctor!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, yes, yes, what is it? Can you get back to me later?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The search program is acting up a bit. For some reason,it says the Holy Grail is right in front of you.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's right! The Holy Grail is here! In front of us!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
WHAT!?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Case closed! Woohoo!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And, Fujimaru seems to be in an awfully good mood?   
   
**Pirate A:**   
Ow! Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing.   
   
**Pirate B:**   
Huuuh? Shut up and mind your own business.   
   
**Pirate A:**   
Huh?   
   
**Pirate B:**   
Huuh?   
   
**Drake:**   
And, now they're fighting. Looks like we have to stop them!   
   
**Mash:**   
This is insane...  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Drake:**   
So...What? You guys came for this magical tankard...  
   
**Drake:**   
I mean the Holy Grail? You can go back to your country if you have this?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Well, that's it, more or less.   
   
**Drake:**   
Hmm. Well, I can't deny that I lost to you,and I even said I'd give you anything but my life.   
   
**Drake:**   
Here, take it. You came here from a distant era, right? Thanks for making the trip.   
   
**Mash:**   
Th-Thank you very much. Since we've retrieved the Holy Grail, we've resolved the Singularity of this era...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Have we?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't think we have.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...You're right.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, the Holy Grail has been secured. Have there been any changes?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Not that I can tell. The Bolt of this era is still left unsecured.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Holy Grail is indeed functioning to a certain extent. But, it's not as strong a force as before.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Maybe it's the real Holy Grail. The one that was in this era to begin with.   
   
**Mash:**   
...In other words, it's different from the Grails we've seen?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah. The Grails that Lev Lainur supposedly placed disrupt the seven Foundations of Humanity.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But, there was another Holy Grail in these seas. Captain Drake is the one chosen by that Grail.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The reason behind the turbulent seas is that the opposing forces, the two Holy Grails, are in contention.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
"The rightful Grail held by the savior Captain Drake,"and "Lev's Holy Grail brought in from the outside to disturb the world. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
As long as Captain Drake is around, this era won't fall. However, it won't return to normal, either.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In order to restore the seas&mdash;I fear we must retrieve Lev's Holy Grail after all.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I see. So it's not as urgent as previous eras,but the final objective is the same.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
   
**Drake:**   
There's that odd voice again...Say, who are you talking to, Mash?   
   
**Drake:**   
You got a pet gnome or something?   
   
**Mash:**   
No, it's not quite that cute. The Doctor is, how shall I say...  
   
**Mash:**   
Think of it as a mysterious fairy,talking to us from a town really far away.   
   
**Drake:**   
Sure. So, he's making you guys fight,while he gets to cozy up in his home?   
   
**Drake:**   
In the end, what's this all about? You get what you came for?   
   
**Mash:**   
...No. It seems there's another Holy Grail, Captain Drake,one that shouldn't exist in this era.   
   
**Mash:**   
Unless we retrieve it,the ocean will be like this forever.   
   
**Drake:**   
Whoa, whoa, that sounds real dangerous.... Are you serious?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Dead serious.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Absolutely.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Which is why I'll give this back to you.... You were meant to have it, Captain.   
   
**Drake:**   
O-Okay. I appreciate your courtesy.   
   
**Drake:**   
...Boy. I've never given up a treasure so easily,or had it returned so easily either...  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, can I get some advice?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
H-Hey, just hang on a second. I'm thinking. This is way beyond what I imagined...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Then, may I ask a few questions?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It's a pleasure to meet you, Francis Drake. I know this may seem very sudden, but do you have a wish?   
   
**Drake:**   
Wish?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
For example, you're a pirate. You wish to gather all the treasures in the world, do you not?   
   
**Drake:**   
Yeah, I suppose I do. So, do I just wish on this Grail to have it come true?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Most likely. Are you going to?   
   
**Drake:**   
Of course not. You know I'm a pirate, right?   
   
**Drake:**   
A pirate that gets treasure by praying&ndash;That's a bad joke if I ever heard one.   
   
**Drake:**   
Treasure should be won through power, wisdom, and courage.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmm, that would mean your immediate wish is simply to secure enough water, food, and safety.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
In other words, you already had that wish granted.   
   
**Drake:**   
...I suppose that's true.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The Holy Grail you hold has the power to create this world. However&ndash;this ocean is not what you desire.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Which means, "something" is causing this world to exist. Someone is disrupting your ocean, and your era.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
There's only one thing to be done, right? You need to reclaim your own world.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The people next to you, Mash Kyrielight and Fujimaru, exist to resolve issues of this nature.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
They're professionals who have defeated what you call "invincible guys" many times.   
   
**Drake:**   
I see...I think I understand now. Thanks.   
   
**Drake:**   
So, who does that make you?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Leonardo Da Vinci. I died about 20 years before you were born. I'm a genius.   
   
**Drake:**   
Oh. Never heard of you.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
W-What...did you say?   
   
**Drake:**   
So, this world is broken after all. Which means that there's no treasure to begin with.   
   
**Mash:**   
You could be right. I don't think there is...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No&mdash;there is! I believe there is!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Doctor?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Aren't you a little too excited?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In this world and era, "pirates" are a common thing.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
For better or worse, the Age of Exploration was an unavoidable event that expanded the world.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The planet's pioneers entrusted their dreams to the unknown seas and the other side of the horizon.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...And with all those "thoughts" and "desires" gathered,I wouldn't be surprised if a treasure really did exist here.   
   
**Drake:**   
So, it does exist? Enough gold and silver and spices to sink this ship?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes. I, Dr. Roman, will guarantee that. There is a treasure&ndash;for sure!   
   
**Drake:**   
...I can't take it. I'm fired up, I'm fired up as hell! All right scumbags, let's drink up a storm first!   
   
**Drake:**   
Our voyage tomorrow is going to be one unlike any other! No guarantee we'll return alive, so drink your hearts out!   
   
**Drake:**   
Treasures! Riches! Spices! Tasty booze and uncharted adventures await us!   
   
**Pirate:**   
CHEERS!   
   
**Mash:**   
Wait, we're drinking again!?   
   
**Pirate:**   
After all, we're pirates! ♪Both you and I are pirates! ♪  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, please! No more singing!   
   
## Section 3: Ghost Ship and New Island   
   
**Drake:**   
All right, we're setting sail! Raise the flag, the Golden Hind is moving out!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Aye, aye, Boss!   
   
**Drake:**   
Blast that cannon! Let's liven things up!   
   
**Mash:**   
Sigh...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're not used to the sea?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. We saw never-ending land last time, but I've never experienced an ocean as far as the eye can see.   
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, don't worry. I haven't let my guard down.... Senpai, you seem to be having fun.   
   
**Mash:**   
Unfortunately, this is not the time for that. I'm afraid things will be slightly different this&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, Senpai! Seagulls! Seagulls over there!   
   
**Mash:**   
And look,I see more pirates there!   
   
**Mash:**   
......  
   
**Mash:**   
Ahem. Now, here I go!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Have fuuuuun.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Good luck.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I-Is it just me,or are you sort of out of it, Master?   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Whew...I'm all sticky from the seawater.   
   
**Drake:**   
Hey, hey, Fujimaru and Mash. Got a second?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, what is it?   
   
**Drake:**   
Those people we took out have vanished. In your eyes, is that possible?   
   
**Mash:**   
...True, they have disappeared. Doctor?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, just as I thought. Seems like it's the concept of pirates that exist in these waters.   
   
**Mash:**   
Concept, you say?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A type of spiritual body etched in the memories of the"Age of Exploration. " They can only act to fulfill their roles.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They have their own will, but are models of an idea. Call them an infinite copy of the "average pirate. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They do little damage, but unless the world is corrected,these "bugs" will keep spawning forever.   
   
**Drake:**   
...What do you mean by that?   
   
**Mash:**   
If I had to sum it up in a single word,those pirates are like...Ghosts.   
   
**Drake:**   
...But, they took damage from bullets, you know? Not just mine either, from the scallywags as well.   
   
**Mash:**   
Sorry, let me rephrase that. Think of them as ghosts with physical bodies.   
   
**Drake:**   
S-So they have physical bodies. Then we're okay! There's no problem!   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, that's correct. Now, let us be on our way!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Drake:**   
By the way.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes?   
   
**Drake:**   
What do you think are in these waters, anyway?   
   
**Mash:**   
If what the doctor says is true,there might be a treasure here.   
   
**Mash:**   
But...That means these waters are basically the same as those in the Age of Exploration.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Which means Drake isn't the only pirate going after the treasure.   
   
**Drake:**   
Ahah! That gets me all fired up! First come, first served. How simple is that?   
   
**Pirate:**   
But Boss,we don't have any leads on that treasure.   
   
**Drake:**   
Fool. We're going to start by finding those leads.   
   
**Pirate:**   
...Boss! An island in sight! East-northeast of here!   
   
**Mash:**   
...It is indeed an island. Doctor?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes. I'm detecting Servants on that island.   
   
**Mash:**   
Captain Drake. That island has those superhumans you mentioned before.   
   
**Mash:**   
Please have all the pirates retreat. The only ones who can fight them are myself, Senpai, and you.   
   
**Drake:**   
Already? Well, you guys are with me this time. Hey scumbags, protect the ship!   
   
**Drake:**   
Fujimaru and I are gonna go check things out!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Roger that, Boss! We look forward to your return!   
   
**Mash:**   
We need to proceed with caution, Master. We still don't know if the Servant is a friend or foe...  
   
**Drake:**   
Hmm...Over there, perhaps?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?   
   
**Mash:**   
Ack! Drake? Is that an enemy?   
   
**Mash:**   
Ahhh! Fou, stop running around!   
   
**Drake:**   
No. But I felt a vague presence, so I took a shot.   
   
**Mash:**   
"Vague? " "Took a shot!? "  
   
**Drake:**   
If you get a bad feeling, fire first, ask later. That's the key to survival, you know?   
   
**Mash:**   
How violent...That's how an outlaw thinks!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So, did it hit?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Did you get it?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Drake:**   
Hah! You won't know until you look for yourself! I'll go see if it's dead or not.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Captain Drake is unlike Jeanne or Nero. She's a type of person we've never encountered before.   
   
**Mash:**   
At any rate, there goes our plan to proceed with caution. Senpai, what should we do?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's calm down.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's play it by ear.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. I will calm down and play it by ear.   
   
**Drake:**   
Hey! Mash, Fujimaru! Come over here!   
   
**Mash:**   
A...Stone tablet?   
   
**Drake:**   
That's right. Can you read what's written on it?   
   
**Mash:**   
It&ndash;appears to be runes of some sort. Doctor, can you decode it?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I see, I see, these are relatively new runes. I'd say they were carved within the last week.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Um, Da Vinci? That's my job, yes? Don't take my job, okay?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Let's see here...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
"Bloodaxe King, once laid to rest, shall awaken once more. "  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...That's the general gist of it. But, Bloodaxe King? Why does that sound familiar&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Th-The Bloodaxe King is the name of the Viking king that ruled Norway in the 9th century!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Be careful. I'm picking up readings similar to those copied pirates from that stone tablet!   
   
**Mash:**   
Enemies?   
   
**Drake:**   
...Yeah, it appears so. I'm getting a very bad vibe here. Mash, Fujimaru!   
   
**Drake:**   
Get ready for a fight...We're goin' in! The first to strike is the winner!   
   
**Drake:**   
...Here they come!   
   
**Pirate:**   
For King Eric,our great and glorious leader!   
   
**Mash:**   
Roger. Master...Let's go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...Whew. The battle has ended, Master.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Searching surroundings...Nothing detected. The nearby Servant signals are not moving.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They haven't noticed us? Anyway, you need to get out of there fast.   
   
**Mash:**   
Roger that. Let's move on.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Drake:**   
Mmm...Sniff, sniff. Treasure, will I get a whiff of that treasure?   
   
**Mash:**   
Captain Drake, treasure has no scent.   
   
**Drake:**   
Ahaha! You think so, Mash? Treasure does indeed have a scent.   
   
**Mash:**   
What?   
   
**Drake:**   
Ah, that look says you don't believe me! All right, let's make a bet.   
   
**Drake:**   
If there's treasure up ahead, like I said...Hmm, what should we do?   
   
**Drake:**   
I know, how about coming with me on a trip around the world?   
   
**Mash:**   
Around the world you say?   
   
**Drake:**   
When I flee these waters and return to England&ndash;I'm going to sail around the world on the Golden Hind.   
   
**Drake:**   
What do you say? If you help me out,I bet I'll be the luckiest pirate ever.   
   
**Mash:**   
Around the world...  
   
**Drake:**   
Of course Fujimaru will come along, too. You're Mash's Master, aren't you?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll see what I can do.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll think about it.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Drake:**   
All right, and if I lose&ndash;If I lose...Hmm, is there anything else you want?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Nothing.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I have enough already.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
There is nothing I want. If I had to choose,having your assistance like this is enough.   
   
**Drake:**   
Really? That's really greedy, you got me there! That's gonna cost you dearly!   
   
**Mash:**   
E-Excuse me? Senpai and I both answered that we've been repaid already. Actually, Senpai, we have a good deal.   
   
**Drake:**   
What's gotten into you? You said you have no wishes. That's the most troublesome wish.   
   
**Drake:**   
Because, you can't buy items that "don't exist. "I am, after all, a merchant!   
   
**Drake:**   
If I can't keep my customers happy, then I'll be a third-rate one. And THAT, I will not have.   
   
**Drake:**   
That's why first,I need to get whatever it is you want.   
   
**Drake:**   
But, you said you couldn't think of anything. Now, this is going to be a problem. How can I deliver something you don't want?   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I see. I'm beginning to understand why this crude outlaw of a woman has THAT skill.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&ndash;Here they come! Servants are on the move.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Looks like they sensed you guys. They're coming in fast!   
   
**Mash:**   
Hopefully we can talk it out with them&ndash;  
   
**F：???:**  
Gagagagaga! Gigigigi&mdash;giiiiiiii!!   
   
**F：???:**  
M-My! My name! Eric! The Grand...Eric!   
   
**F：???:**  
Gah-go! Kill! Kill anyone in the way! Kill. KILL! Gigigiiii&ndash;!   
   
**Mash:**   
...He's not getting it.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Seems so.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Good luck.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Mash Kyrielight&ndash;going in! Captain Drake!   
   
**Drake:**   
Sure thing! Vikings from Norway! They're like our ancestors, you know&ndash;  
   
**Drake:**   
I'll pay my respects, but also give him a dose of reality! Fujimaru, this is how we say it in the pirate world!   
   
**Drake:**   
"Shut up, you bearded freak! The old need to retire! "  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Eric Bloodaxe:**   
Gi, gi, gi...Ga, ga, ga...Not giving it to you! It's mine!   
   
**Eric Bloodaxe:**   
It is...mine...but...  
   
**Mash:**   
...Eric Bloodaxe has been eliminated.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait, that's odd. He vanished, but there's still a Servant response...  
   
**Mash:**   
What's the matter?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? It's gone. Hmm, since coming to this era, I've been off my game.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sorry, the equipment's not in the best shape. It's going to be a little hard to track you.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There are no more Servants on that island,and those pirates from before are all gone.   
   
**Drake:**   
I see. Then how about we go on a treasure hunt?   
   
**Mash:**   
Do you think there's treasure, Senpai?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I do.   
   
**Mash:**   
Really? ...It would be interesting if there was one.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't.   
   
**Mash:**   
If you consider it rationally, there shouldn't be.... Though it would be fun if there were.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Drake:**   
Hey! Over here! I found something!   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? You did? Let's go, Master!   
   
**Drake:**   
See this ship? It's probably the one that king was on.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, can you find out?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yeah, but I don't think there's any need. It's a larger version of the ships the Vikings used.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Therefore, it should look like something out of the 9th century...but it's good as new.   
   
**Mash:**   
It does not appear to be...a treasure.   
   
**Drake:**   
Sure it is. You guys wait right here. If this is a Viking ship, I'm sure it has one&ndash;  
   
**Drake:**   
Found it. Treasure!   
   
**Mash:**   
...A book?   
   
**Drake:**   
When sailing, Vikings record everything from starting point to destination using pictures and glyphs.   
   
**Drake:**   
Coast shapes, shoal spots, current traits, and paths&ndash;  
   
**Drake:**   
If they appeared here out of the blue that's one thing,but if they sailed here...  
   
**Drake:**   
Yes, I smell fresh ink! This must be the chart for this island and it's surroundings.   
   
**Drake:**   
There's no better treasure for us since we're about to set sail into the seas, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
...You have a good point. Captain Drake, well...You seem violent, but you're actually pretty pragmatic.   
   
**Drake:**   
Impressed? Now, how about that trip around the world?   
   
**Mash:**   
Umm...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll think about it.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
After this battle is over.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Drake:**   
I see, I see! With you guys, our strength would be a hundredfold! We'll depart after restocking food and water.   
   
**Drake:**   
Now, time to return to the ship!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai, are you sure about this? By correcting this era, the memories of us&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not a problem.   
   
**Mash:**   
...As her memories disappear,I suppose the problem itself will be gone, but...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I forgot about that.   
   
**Mash:**   
Wait, Senpai...Were you really planning on sailing around the world?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh, please stop teasing me!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Drake:**   
Now, according to the Viking map&ndash;there's an island to the northwest.   
   
**Drake:**   
Considering our speed, it'll take about 10 hours. If we can catch wind, maybe even less.   
   
**Mash:**   
We can have the glyphs analyzed. Doctor, I'm transferring the data.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Very well. One book shouldn't be an issue over here. That said, I'd like a summoning point established soon.   
   
**Mash:**   
Let's hope there's a Leyline on the next island.   
   
**Drake:**   
All right, you scallywags! Time to set sail!   
   
## Section 4: Lightning and Goddess   
   
**E：???:**  
(Pant, pant, pant...)  
   
**E：???:**  
Ugh, no good. So tired, can't move, can't run.   
   
**E：???:**  
I've never run so much in my life. Why am I a Servant in the first place?   
   
**E：???:**  
I don't see "myself" here&ndash;Nor my "loser sister" either...  
   
**E：???:**  
...No, even if that girl isn't here, I'm fine. I'm so fine in all sorts of ways...  
   
**E：???:**  
Sigh...I wonder who I'm talking to.   
   
**E：???:**  
In the first place, this maze is "that" labyrinth, right? There's no way...out of here...and no string.   
   
**E：???:**  
...Wait, that means HE is here. As long as this labyrinth exists, HE is sure to be here.   
   
**E：???:**  
!!! I knew it...  
   
**E：???:**  
Something's coming from behind, too...ARGH! What am I supposed to do?   
   
**E：???:**  
Auuuuuggggghhhh!   
   
**Drake:**   
Hmm?   
   
**Mash:**   
Something the matter?   
   
**Drake:**   
Yes, the air tastes different here.   
   
**Mash:**   
Tastes...different?   
   
**Drake:**   
In different countries and lands, the air changes flavor.   
   
**Drake:**   
The distance between England and France aside,when you travel to a new continent, the air really tastes differently.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm. Perhaps Miss Drake can detect changes in the wind due to differences in temperature and currents?   
   
**Drake:**   
What's this "Miss Drake" business? You sound creepy when you put it that way, Mister Scholar!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
S-Sorry. Please excuse me, Drake.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash, Fujimaru. What Drake says may be correct.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Your current location has obvious different temperatures and currents than the previous island.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
With a little more time, I'm sure we can determine exactly where you are.   
   
**Pirate:**   
Boss! There's a ship to the northwest!   
   
**Drake:**   
All right, what flag?   
   
**Pirate:**   
A pirate's flag I've never seen!   
   
**Drake:**   
So, an enemy! Mash, Fujimaru, get ready! Time to get to work!   
   
**Mash:**   
Aye, aye, Captain Drake! Here we go, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Drake:**   
All right, this side's taken care of.   
   
**Mash:**   
This side as well. They were below average in combat power.   
   
**Pirate:**   
Boss, here's their Jolly Roger.   
   
**Drake:**   
Hmm, it doesn't look familiar. Mash, do you have any ideas?   
   
**Mash:**   
If it's a famous flag, it might be in our records. Doctor, can you look into this?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Okay. You'll have the results right away.   
   
**Drake:**   
All right, then I'm advancing this ship. If this chart is right, the island should be in sight soon!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes. This island is way bigger than the other one. That's why we were able to locate a Leyline.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm sending you the coordinates, just follow them for now. But be careful...I'm detecting multiple life-forms.   
   
**Mash:**   
Roger that. Drake, we'd like to head this way. Would that be all right with you?   
   
**Drake:**   
It's fine. I was thinking of going in the same direction as well.   
   
**Mash:**   
Then we'll depart. Let's go, Senpai.   
   
**Drake:**   
This place is huge...Hard to imagine it's an island. This wind is amazing.   
   
**Mash:**   
...All true. Master, doesn't this feel like the time we were in&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Rome?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. I think it's a bit like when we were in Rome.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
France?   
   
**Mash:**   
I believe it's closer to Rome than France.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Master,we're almost at the designated coordinates.   
   
**Drake:**   
...What the heck is that?   
   
**Mash:**   
That&ndash;appears to be a skeleton,but something is slightly off.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Dragon Tooth Warriors. Soldiers forged from dragon fangs. Fujimaru, dispose of them.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
The battle has ended, Master. Creating terminal point.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Huh? Something just...  
   
**Mash:**   
What's wrong?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, just my imagination. You can start setting up as usual.   
   
**Mash:**   
Very well. Now, then&ndash;  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
&ndash;All right, everyone. Time for a little history lesson,courtesy of yours truly.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Right now, you're in the middle of the Age of Exploration.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Many things were imported from the East, and Europe started advancing into the new land, fighting to gain a foothold.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
One of many things imported from the East were spices. Nutmeg, cloves, and peppercorns...or pepper.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Pepper was necessary to help eat decomposing meat. In this era, it was more precious than gold.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Case in point. I just transferred a pepper shaker to you. What do you think would happen when you hand that to Captain Drake.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Try it.   
   
**Drake:**   
Seeeeeeeeriously?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She collapsed.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She passed out.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Amusing, right? Oh, and be sure to retrieve it. We shouldn't aimlessly disrupt their economy.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
In the meanwhile, the summoning circle is up. Use it to your heart's content.   
   
**Mash:**   
Summoning circle confirmed. Terminal point established.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, and yes...I got a hit on that pirate flag from earlier&ndash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's the flag of the legendary ■ate, ■■ of the "■■. "In other words, those pirates are ■■■ called ■■■■■.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor? Doctor, the communications are acting up&ndash;Doctor!?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
We've lost contact. What on earth could have...  
   
**Mash:**   
Eek! An earthquake?   
   
**Drake:**   
Get down. It's a big one!   
   
**Mash:**   
...It settled down. Master, are you all right?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm fine.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No injuries.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Seems that way. Thank goodness. How about you, Drake?   
   
**Drake:**   
That was a breeze compared to a raging ocean. But I'm worried about my ship and crew. Can we go back for a bit?   
   
**Mash:**   
Let's do that.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Mash:**   
The summoning circle has been established,but communications are still cut off.   
   
**Mash:**   
We should move away from here, perhaps.   
   
**Drake:**   
Huh? Hey, what's wrong? Something up?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Boss...The ship won't move.   
   
**Drake:**   
Huh?   
   
**Pirate:**   
The ship, Boss! The ship won't budge, not an inch!   
   
**Drake:**   
...Sorry,but could you guys wait a second?   
   
**Drake:**   
No good, it won't move. But I don't think there's anything wrong with the ship itself.   
   
**Drake:**   
It's stuck like something's anchoring it real tight.   
   
**Drake:**   
What on earth is happening? Fujimaru, this is your specialty, right?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A type of Magecraft?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A type of Bounded Field?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, I believe that is correct. It looks like a Bounded Field has been drawn all around.   
   
**Mash:**   
Its rank is low enough for Demi-Servants like me to escape...But I can't say the same for the ship.   
   
**Mash:**   
Unless we take down whoever is creating this field,I'm afraid we'll be stuck here forever.   
   
**Drake:**   
What are we gonna do?   
   
**Mash:**   
Search and destroy. There is no other means of escape.   
   
**Drake:**   
All right, if you say so then it must be true. Men! Stand your ground!   
   
**Drake:**   
Behave and stay put. The real fight's gonna be above sea. Don't be wasting stuff!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Aye, aye, Boss!   
   
**Drake:**   
This is rather dull. That fortress earlier was completely empty, too.   
   
**Mash:**   
To begin with, it's mysterious that artificial structures are on this island.   
   
**Mash:**   
But that pattern...Could it be?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Hmmm? Is there a hole in that mountain?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's take a look.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go inside.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
This is...  
   
**Drake:**   
Is this what you call a dungeon? Oh boy, the pirate blood in me is heating up!   
   
**Mash:**   
Wait! We have no idea what the scope of this place is. I suggest we retreat at once and&ndash;  
   
**Drake:**   
The way I see it, retreating's not gonna change a thing. That's what it means to stay on my ship.   
   
**Drake:**   
Leave behind that goodie-goodie old self, Mash! Now, onwards! Treasure awaits!   
   
**Mash:**   
I think we're rushing it too much...  
   
**Drake:**   
See, they're here. Let's clean this up quickly!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
I mean...Seriously!   
   
**Drake:**   
Right or left...My gut says left!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Should we trust her instincts?   
   
**Mash:**   
I don't think so...But Captain Drake is a first-rate pirate.   
   
**Mash:**   
She must also have keen intuition.... P-Probably.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Remember where the entrance is?   
   
**Mash:**   
Don't worry, I've recorded everything just in case. Not that I'd ever forget...  
   
**Mash:**   
It's just a matter of going back the way we came. Getting separated along the way would be a bigger problem.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Oh I know. Master, let's hold hands.   
   
**Mash:**   
It'd be a disaster if we got separated here. Holding hands would prevent that from happening.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's embarrassing...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We don't have to...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Umm...I understand how you feel,but this is no time to be embarrassed, Master.   
   
**Mash:**   
If we get separated,we might be wandering in this maze until we die.   
   
**Mash:**   
It may be a bit awkward at first,but better safe than sorry...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you embarrassed too, Mash?   
   
**Mash:**   
...N-No comment.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm not embarrassed.   
   
**Mash:**   
Th-That's fine. I feel...Slightly embarrassed...I think.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
At any rate, we have now just proven that holding hands is necessary.   
   
**Mash:**   
If you'll excuse me.   
   
**Mash:**   
...That reminds me, back then&ndash;You held my hand like this, too.   
   
**Mash:**   
Now, it feels nostalgic. Even though not much time has passed.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou. Fou, Fou!   
   
**Drake:**   
Hmmm? Hang on a moment.... I smell something.   
   
**Mash:**   
What is it?   
   
**Drake:**   
Blood.   
   
**Drake:**   
...Well, with my job I'm used to smelling stuff like this.   
   
**Mash:**   
Look, the drops form a trail.   
   
**Drake:**   
Looks like the wound itself wasn't that bad. A flesh wound.   
   
**Mash:**   
It's our only clue. We should follow it!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Drake:**   
The blood trail stops here. I guess we'll have to give up tracking it further?   
   
**Mash:**   
Not necessarily. Master, please stand back.   
   
**Drake:**   
This is great. I was getting bored of dungeon-crawling anyway.   
   
**Drake:**   
Let's take a break and light our guns up! All right, bring it on!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Drake:**   
Well, fighting these non-humans, including the bones back there, means I now got some more great tales to tell.   
   
**Drake:**   
Anyway, even these things die when you shoot a lead bullet through them. I learned something!   
   
**Mash:**   
No, normally that wouldn't have any effect. It's because you possess the Holy Grail...  
   
**Mash:**   
I think it continuously grants your wish of,"Whatever it is, gunfire is effective. "  
   
**Drake:**   
Oh, is that what it is? So, I guess I shouldn't wonder about when the Wild Hunt is happening then.   
   
**F：???:**  
Hey, it looks like they're here again. I thought you wiped them out...  
   
**F：???:**  
Oh dear, isn't this just troublesome. What do you wanna do?   
   
**F：???:**  
...Hmmm. If you want to rampage, then be my guest?   
   
**F：???:**  
Let me warn you...I don't like breaking a sweat. So, I'm not helping you.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Drake:**   
Hmmm...It's not like we're lost in here,but I'm still getting all kinds of bad vibes.   
   
**Mash:**   
Bad vibes? What about you, Master?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm getting bad vibes, too.   
   
**Mash:**   
I see. If both you and the captain say so,perhaps we should be careful.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I sense an encounter!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Encounter?   
   
**Mash:**   
Hmm...What on earth could we encounter inside this dungeon, Master?   
   
**Mash:**   
Don't tell me you're expecting to run into[♂ a cute girl /♀ a cute boy]...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Drake:**   
!!! Stop right there!   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Drake:**   
Seems my hunch was right. Something's headed our way!   
   
**Mash:**   
This is...a Servant!   
   
**H：???:**  
...Die.   
   
**Drake:**   
I-It's huge! What on earth is this thing?   
   
**Asterios:**   
Me...Asterios...Kill...All...You!   
   
**Mash:**   
Another Berserker, like Eric the Bloodaxe King! Guess there's no use arguing!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, please be careful. Asterios is his lesser-known, original name&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
People more commonly know him as the "Minotaur. "He's one of the monsters from Greek mythology!   
   
**Mash:**   
This labyrinth is his territory. Retreat is not an option.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Let's go, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Th-That was close! Wait...No way!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Ugh...gi! Uh...uhh!   
   
**Drake:**   
You're still alive after eating all those bullets? Talk about gluttony!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Pro...tect!   
   
**Drake:**   
Then it's time to bring out the culverin cannons! If we blow his head off, he's sure to go down!   
   
**Drake:**   
Now&ndash;give Davy Jones my regards!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Ugh!   
   
**F：???:**  
...Hold up!   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh no...Two Servants?   
   
**F：???:**  
All right! All right! I guess I just have to go with you.   
   
**F：???:**  
Do whatever you want with me! Just hurry up!   
   
**F：???:**  
Asterios is near death. He wouldn't be much use to you.   
   
**F：???:**  
Besides, if we take too long, he'll die and then the labyrinth will collapse on you.   
   
**F：???:**  
&ndash;We should hurry back. Leave the navigation to me.   
   
**Asterios:**   
...Uh...  
   
**Mash:**   
U-Umm,I'm sorry. Do you have a moment?   
   
**F：???:**  
What is it, Miss Lame-Shield? Let's hurry up and go where "he" is.   
   
**Mash:**   
L-Lame!?   
   
**Drake:**   
Hey brat, don't talk to us like that. You're the one getting rescued.   
   
**F：???:**  
Huh? I don't think that's a way to talk to a grown woman.   
   
**Drake:**   
&ndash;Some nerve. Wanna sub in for the goddess statue at the ship's bow?   
   
**Euryale:**   
Goddess statue? ...I'm not really sure what you mean,but I AM the goddess, Euryale.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Wait, you chased after me not even knowing that?   
   
**Euryale:**   
Obviously, you wouldn't have anything like me,a full super idol, on board your ship.   
   
**Euryale:**   
You should at least remember my name, sheesh. Where are you from anyway, third-rate pirate?   
   
**Drake:**   
Y-You little brat!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I want to clear something up.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You've misunderstood.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Huh? What? Wait...Why, you're a human.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Hm? Hmmm? Are you the Master of "that thing? "What brings you here?   
   
**Euryale:**   
No, before all else, if you're the Master you must discipline your Servants!   
   
**Euryale:**   
What's with that perverted Servant anyway? You can't find something that disgusting, even in Greece!   
   
**Mash:**   
U-Umm, excuse me&ndash;It's not like we were chasing you!   
   
**Euryale:**   
...Huh? Then what on earth were you doing?   
   
**Mash:**   
We are&ndash;  
   
**Euryale:**   
Are. You. Serious&ndash;! You guys are so misleading!   
   
**Mash:**   
Look who's talking!   
   
**Mash:**   
You trapped us inside a Bounded Field. Wouldn't it be natural for us to assume you're our enemy?   
   
**Asterios:**   
Guh...  
   
**Euryale:**   
Ahh, Asterios! You don't have to move.   
   
**Euryale:**   
You're tough. If you just stay still, you won't die.... You won't die, right?   
   
**Asterios:**   
...Urm.   
   
**Euryale:**   
There's no need to worry. These guys aren't associated with "him. "  
   
**Mash:**   
...Pardon me. We were a bit shaken up as well. Asterios over there is the one who put up the Bounded Field?   
   
**Euryale:**   
That's right. But it wasn't to trap you guys in. It was to prevent the enemies outside from entering.   
   
**Mash:**   
I see. But, unless you remove this field,we'll be stuck in here...  
   
**Euryale:**   
...Mmm, fine.   
   
**Drake:**   
Well, that didn't take a lot of convincing.   
   
**Euryale:**   
It's a simple numbers game.   
   
**Euryale:**   
There are only two ways out of here. Either Asterios dies, or we remove the field.   
   
**Euryale:**   
In that case, I'd rather remove the field.... It's much better than being alone.   
   
**Drake:**   
...I see. Yes, I like you.   
   
**Drake:**   
But, you're so cornered that you had to put up this "Bounded Field" thing, right?   
   
**Euryale:**   
&ndash;It has nothing to do with you.   
   
**Drake:**   
It does! See, I love interesting things.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...Huh?   
   
**Drake:**   
A trip around the world. Adventure. Dungeons. Monsters. This world has so many interesting things to offer!   
   
**Drake:**   
Interesting things tend to be more valuable. That's how this world works. That's why I became a pirate. But that's that.   
   
**Drake:**   
Anyway, you smell like money. That's why I'm bringing you aboard my ship.   
   
**Euryale:**   
H-Hey! You can't just decide that on your own! Board your ship? You must be insane!   
   
**Euryale:**   
I already decided! I'm not leaving Asterios behind!   
   
**Drake:**   
Who said anything like that? Asterios over there is coming with us, too.   
   
**Asterios:**   
...  
   
**Euryale:**   
...Huh?   
   
**Drake:**   
So much guts and power...And, quite a hunk if you look at him long enough!   
   
**Drake:**   
I'd be the laughingstock of pirates if I let this talent slip by! Hey, would you like to be a bodyguard on my ship?   
   
**Drake:**   
If you refuse, there's nothing I can do. Hey you, will you die unless you're cooped up inside a labyrinth?   
   
**Euryale:**   
Th-That's not really the case.... Are you sure?   
   
**Drake:**   
Of course I am. I'll pay you well, too. Oh, but don't expect any benefits from us.   
   
**Euryale:**   
That's not the issue. I mean...As long as you are okay with it.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...Asterios. What do you want to do?   
   
**Asterios:**   
Go.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...Are you sure?   
   
**Asterios:**   
If...you...go...me...follow. Alone...lonely.   
   
**Euryale:**   
I see. Very well, then...We'll board your ship.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Ah! But I'll need you to prepare my own room. I have no intent of showing my face to common pirates.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Of course, your ship has a bath, right? Oh, and also&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, Senpai! ...It seems things went quite well without us interjecting.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Happily ever after.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
All's well that ends well.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Good point.   
   
**Mash:**   
Still, a Minotaur was supposedly a monster. One that devoured children offered up as sacrifice, but&ndash;  
   
**Euryale :**   
Put me on your shoulders, Asterios. Oh my, you're even taller than my "loser sister. "  
   
**Asterios:**   
Uh...Uh...Uh...  
   
**Euryale :**   
Ouch! Crouch down a little more! My head's gonna hit the ceiling!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Uuu...  
   
**Drake:**   
Ahahaha! Goddesses sure have lots of demands!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
## Section 5: Blackbeard's Misery   
   
**G：???:**  
&ndash;I always do wonder...Isn't he ashamed to be alive?   
   
**H：???:**  
Now, Mary. You can't say such things.   
   
**H：???:**  
Earthworms, cockroaches, even plague-ridden sewer rats are all living beings, you know?   
   
**H：???:**  
That means it's okay for this Servant to live. I shall allow it.   
   
**F：???:**  
Ohoho! LOL My, my, such intense and poisonous talk you're engaging in! LOLOLOL   
   
**F：???:**  
Heh heh! LOL Missy Anne is always so gentle when she throttles me!   
   
**F：???:**  
Because I'm naïve, if you ever said that to me,I'd have to *&£¢% you both on the spot! (Just kidding! )  
   
**Mary:**   
...Let's kill him, Anne. He shouldn't exist in this world.   
   
**Anne:**   
I said no.   
   
**Anne:**   
If you keep your distance, he's just a harmful,unpleasant, and stinking guy, right?   
   
**Anne:**   
Now Captain, give us your orders soon, or I'll gouge, crush, and blow away that lighter-than-a-balloon head of yours.   
   
**F：???:**  
Oops, good heavens me! LOL Sorry, sorry. Please, let me work hard from now on. LOLOLOL   
   
**Anne:**   
...  
   
**Mary:**   
Anne, calm down or you might pop a vessel.   
   
**F：???:**  
Going into totally serious mode! Wowowowow! It's coming, coming, coming&ndash;  
   
**F：???:**  
...And so, my brothers. The licky-enthusiast's treasured Muse Euryale&ndash;  
   
**F：???:**  
Let's go catch her! Oh, and the you-know-what from the old hag, too!   
   
**Anne:**   
Huhuhu. That's the main target, idiot.   
   
**Mary:**   
No good, he can only think about Euryale. Fine, we'll just have to be careful.   
   
**F：???:**  
Duhuhuhu! Missy Euryale is so fine! I love her so much!   
   
**F：???:**  
Now, Missy Mary Read! Missy Anne Bonny! Mistah Eric Bloodaxe! And&ndash;  
   
**F：???:**  
Teacher! Our teacher! Please, take the field!   
   
**E：???:**  
Ah, I wonder...I never did anything great enough to be called a teacher, yeah? As you can see, I'm an underdog.   
   
**F：???:**  
Haha, stop joking! With you by our side, great hero of the Trojan War, our power level will be over 9000!   
   
**F：???:**  
Plus we've had a nutritionally balanced breakfast! Great and Ne-great!   
   
**E：???:**  
...Hey, guys. Are you really okay with a captain like this? Hello?   
   
**Mary:**   
...  
   
**Anne:**   
...  
   
**F：???:**  
Ahnm, these freezing glares feel so good. They should be coming out soon...Fuhehe!   
   
**Euryale:**   
All right. Remove the Bounded Field.   
   
**Asterios:**   
Under...stood...  
   
**Drake:**   
Geez! If you're gonna shout, tell us first!   
   
**Asterios:**   
...  
   
**Euryale:**   
There. The Bounded Field has been removed. Now, let's go.   
   
**Asterios:**   
Mm.   
   
**Pirate:**   
He's huge! Huge! And scary!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Boss? Are we taking these two with us as well?   
   
**Drake:**   
What's this "scary" nonsense! You guys are veteran pirates! Yes. Those two are guests.   
   
**Drake:**   
Erm...What're your names again?   
   
**Euryale:**   
Remember! I'm Euryale. And he is Asterios.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Just so you know, we're the same as that human named Mash.   
   
**Euryale:**   
If you touch me, I will beat you up, okay?   
   
**Mash:**   
How aggressive...  
   
**Euryale:**   
With matters like this, it's better to make things clear from the start.   
   
**Drake:**   
Okay, Fujimaru's on board, too. It's time to set sail!   
   
**Drake:**   
Good weather, low waves. It's a really good day!   
   
**Drake:**   
Days like this make me want to grab a drink.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Isn't that every day?   
   
**Drake:**   
Hahaha! You're right!   
   
**Pirate A:**   
Boss! Unknown ship detected starboard!   
   
**Drake:**   
Okay, let's deal with it,then booze it up!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Drake:**   
...Now, according to the map, the next island is a bit further...Huh?   
   
**Mash:**   
What's the matter?   
   
**Drake:**   
Oh, the wind just changed direction. There might be a storm around sunset.   
   
**Drake:**   
You guys, get the freight and food organized!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Aye, aye!   
   
**Euryale:**   
～♪  
   
**Asterios:**   
...Song?   
   
**Euryale:**   
Oh, did you hear that?   
   
**Asterios:**   
Yes.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Well, fine then. I'll let you hear it as a special treat.   
   
**Euryale:**   
La-la-la♪  
   
**Drake:**   
I like it. Beautiful songs are so soothing...  
   
**Euryale:**   
Oh Captain,I don't remember giving you the permission to listen.   
   
**Drake:**   
Oh, don't be like that!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Fine. But it's not something you get to hear often.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Be grateful, and listen to the music of a goddess.   
   
**Mash:**   
...It is a beautiful song.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
   
**Euryale:**   
There. The end.   
   
**Asterios:**   
Mmm...  
   
**Mash:**   
Euryale, I have a question. Why are people chasing after you?   
   
**Euryale:**   
You sure know how to open up old wounds.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm sorry. But I thought it was something I should still ask.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...Hmmm. Since you don't mean ill, I'll forgive you.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...See. I'm cute, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Huh?   
   
**Euryale:**   
I said, I'm cute, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
Erm...Well...Yes.   
   
**Euryale:**   
You think so too, right?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're cute.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're beautiful.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Yes, I'm pretty and cute. That's why guys always want me...  
   
**Euryale:**   
But this time, the most atrocious pervert is after me. A strange pirate, just like Drake.   
   
**Mash:**   
A pirate?   
   
**Euryale:**   
Not just an ordinary pirate. A "Pirate Servant" is after me.   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Euryale:**   
I don't know his True Name. But, he's certainly the most disgusting guy in the world.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Even Scylla would feel pretty in front of him.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Not strong, not scary, but disgusting...What kind of pirate is he?   
   
**Euryale:**   
More importantly...Asterios,are your wounds better now?   
   
**Asterios:**   
...Mmm.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Oh, I see. Then you'll be all right carrying me on your shoulders?   
   
**Asterios:**   
Mhm...  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Euryale :**   
All right, what a great view&ndash;What? What's wrong, Asterios?   
   
**Asterios:**   
...Ugh.   
   
**Pirate:**   
Boss! A ship up ahead!   
   
**Drake:**   
Are they pirates?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Yes! ...Oh, it's THAT flag! Boss! That ship's raising the same flag we've seen before!   
   
**Drake:**   
Meaning they're enemies! ...Huh? That ship looks familiar...  
   
**Mash:**   
That flag...I know! Doctor!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mash? Thank goodness, I finally got through! What in the world's happening over there?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
 I forgot about that...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
 It slipped my mind.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What, you forgot about me? I'm the lovable and reliable Dr. Roman, remember?   
   
**Mash:**   
Sorry, but can we talk about it later?   
   
**Mash:**   
Could you tell us about that flag again? Communications broke down and we couldn't hear you.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh, yeah. That flag is&ndash;a legendary Jolly Roger. Belonging to the most infamous pirate in history!   
   
**Mash:**   
Most infamous...In history...It can't be!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Right! Blackbeard! His True Name is Edward Teach! Be careful, Mash!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Unfortunately, Doctor, it's too late.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What?   
   
**Drake:**   
Ah! It's him! It's him! The pirate who was chasing my ship!   
   
**Drake:**   
I found him at last. I'll blast him beyond the horizon!   
   
**Euryale:**   
(...Sneak sneak...)  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...  
   
**Drake:**   
Hey, are you listening you hairy oaf?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Huh? Sorry, my ears don't pick up old-hag noises!   
   
**Drake:**   
&mdash;Say that again?   
   
**Mash:**   
...What?   
   
**Drake:**   
What. Did. You. Just. Say?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I- just- said! I didn't ask for old hags! What's with them useless huge knockers? Is that a joke?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Guess scars are okay? Blade scars are great,they turn me on. But, the age, that's a slight problem.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
If it were only half that, you'd be in my strike zone. Du'huhuhuhu!   
   
**Drake:**   
...  
   
**Pirate:**   
Boss? Boss? She's dead...(Inside. )  
   
**Euryale:**   
It's hopeless. She's all frozen up. I was the same during my first encounter, too.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...I'm surprised I survived it.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Mm-hooooooooo! You really are here, Euryale-chan!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Ah, really cute! Cute! Kawaii! I want to lick and be licked! Mainly armpits and groin!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Oh, and step on me, too! Barefoot! Step all over me! I want to be treated like a cockroach!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Don't you all want that, too?   
   
**Euryale:**   
Uh...I don't like this...  
   
**Asterios:**   
...  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
What? You there! Big guy! You're in my way!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Show me, show me, show me, Missy Euryale!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Huh? I'm sorry, I almost passed out.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Me too.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's no wonder.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Erm...What is that?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
B-Blackbeard...maybe?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
S-Servant...maybe?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I refuse. I won't admit that he is a Servant.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...Hmm?   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Mm...Mm, mm-hmm...I approve! You're accepted! Ta-da-dah-da-da-dah!   
   
**Mash:**   
Eek!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Mmmm, who was the one that liked one eye covered? I think it was that guy Bartholomew?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
No, his fetish was both eyes covered...Well, it doesn't matter.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Anyway, you Servant there! Tell me your name! If you don't&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
I-If I don't what?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I will dream about you tonight when I sleep♪  
   
**Mash:**   
My name is Mash Kyrielight! I'm a Demi-Servant!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Mash...Mash...Mashmallow. Mallow mallow...How beautifully raunchy...Bofufufufu...  
   
**Mash:**   
Please save me, Senpai! The goose bumps just won't stop popping up.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There, there.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Pat, pat.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Th...Thank you very much. But, what can we do...  
   
**Mash:**   
Someone so disgusting...How do we deal with him...  
   
**Drake:**   
...Fire!   
   
**Pirate:**   
What?   
   
**Drake:**   
Cannons.   
   
**Pirate:**   
B-Boss?   
   
**Drake:**   
Cannons. Every single one. I don't care. Just fire! Otherwise I will pack you guys in as cannonballs and fire!   
   
**Pirate:**   
A-Aye, aye, Captain!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Oh, old hag-chan? You mad? You mad, bro? Like huff and puff?   
   
**Drake:**   
Bring the ship around! Send that bearded fool down to Davy Jones' Locker!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Oh my, how scary. Mm, Mr. Bloodaxe King.   
   
**Eric:**   
...Gigigi.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Can you take a minute and grab you-know-what from that old hag for me?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Meanwhile I will be busy here licking Euryale! 'Tis my duty as a human being!   
   
**Euryale:**   
...Hey Fujimaru. You too, Servant.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Make sure that disgusting sea roach doesn't come near me. Protect me well. Got that?   
   
**Euryale:**   
Fortunately, my class is Archer. I can at least give you some cover.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Understood. Mash Kyrielight...heading in!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Euryale:**   
More incoming!   
   
**Asterios:**   
...Me...Kill!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Asterios, don't move in your state! You're already injured!   
   
**Asterios:**   
...Ugh...  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Drake:**   
Fire the cannons. Fire, FIRE!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
We're coming alongside them, everyone! Go Team Blackbeard! Yeah!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Go Team Blackbeard! Yeah!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Go Team Blackbeard! Yeah! (glances)  
   
**Pirate:**   
Yeah!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...(glances)  
   
**Mary:**   
...You want us to join in, too?   
   
**Anne:**   
Ahaha, no way. If we have to do that,I'd rather be killed by Command Spells.   
   
**Anne:**   
...Ah, actually that sounds good right about now. Teach, could you order us to commit suicide?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
You hate being my subordinate that much?   
   
**Mary & Anne:**   
Yep.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Don't say that. Please help me...  
   
**Anne:**   
I don't really think you need our help. Why don't you just steamroll them with your Noble Phantasm?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Dammit! No good! Our cannonballs are bouncing off!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Their armor thickness is on another level! Crap...They're coming on board!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Drake:**   
Damn! Seriously? Our only option is to retreat!   
   
**Mash:**   
Can we retreat from this chaos?   
   
**Drake:**   
We have to! Reload the cannons! We'll use smoke bombs to create a diversion!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Here it comes, Boss!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Hey! Don't overexert yourself, old hag! If you behave and hand over the Holy Grail, we'll let you go, yeah?   
   
**Drake:**   
Holy Grail!?   
   
**Mash:**   
They know about the Grail?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Hey, are you gonna hand over the Grail or what?   
   
**Drake:**   
Shut up! Keep your mouth shut!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Gyafufufu! Scary, scary! LOLOLOL   
   
**Eric:**   
Gigigigigi! Kill! This time, kill for sure!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Eric Bloodaxe? How?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
W-We already defeated him, right!? We even verified he vanished&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He didn't vanish.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Something strange is...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Th-That's right! There was a turbulence in the magical energies that shape the Servants.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Could it be...teleportation? Then, he's a Servant that Blackbeard summoned to begin with!   
   
**Mash:**   
A Servant summoning another Servant...Is that even possible? By BLACKBEARD!?   
   
**Mash:**   
Perhaps he has a Holy Grail, or something similar in nature in his possession?   
   
**Eric:**   
Kiiiiiiiillll!   
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Kyaaa!?   
   
**Asterios:**   
Di...e!   
   
**Eric:**   
Yooouuuuuuuuu!!   
   
**Euryale:**   
What are you doing, Asterios? You can't!   
   
**Mash:**   
Asterios, stand back! This time I will finish him for sure!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Eric:**   
...Kill...you...kill...you...Damn...Get...Holy...Grail...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
All right! He's gone for sure this time! We defeated Eric Bloodaxe!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Hohohohoho! It's too soon to be happy! LOLOLOL   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Eric Bloodaxe was the lowest rank among us Blackbeard Pirates!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Plus he smelled bloody all over, his armpits reeked, and his feet were greasy. There was nothing good about him!   
   
**Mary:**   
That's all you, Captain.   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Something just...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...He's so stubborn! That guy!   
   
**C：???:**  
You don't let your guard down. Good girl, good girl.   
   
**C：???:**  
I thought it would be easier if we killed the Master as soon as possible...  
   
**C：???:**  
&ndash;You're really something special. What kind of Servant are you?   
   
**C：???:**  
Well, if you're defeated by something of this caliber,then it's not worth "letting you live. "  
   
**C：???:**  
Do your best, young girl.   
   
**Drake:**   
If that's the case...  
   
**Drake:**   
All right! Set sails! Hard starboard! We're gonna get away from them!   
   
**Drake:**   
We are faster compared to that bulky ship!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Aye, aye!   
   
**Mary:**   
Ah, they shot the ropes connecting the ships. Looks like they're trying to flee.   
   
**Anne:**   
Hum. She shoots as well as I do.   
   
**Anne:**   
As expected from Francis Drake,the first person to survive a trip around the world.   
   
**Anne:**   
&ndash;Though, doing nothing does make me feel bad. I guess I'll help a little bit.   
   
**Mary:**   
Anne, you're so earnest.   
   
**Anne:**   
Huhuhu. In the end, it's only a show, Mary.   
   
**Anne:**   
My bullet. My pride. Our name is Freedom. Catch the prey like a falcon...Just kidding.   
   
**Drake:**   
Ugh...What happened?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Seems like an explosion in the bilge!   
   
**Drake:**   
What!?   
   
**Mash:**   
Impossible!   
   
**Drake:**   
Dammit, they'll catch up. No, at this rate, we'll sink before that!   
   
**Drake:**   
I'll go fix the hole in the bilge! You guys keep the ship balanced!   
   
**Pirate:**   
That's unreasonable, Boss! Everybody, stop the boss!   
   
**Drake:**   
Hey, let me go, idiots! If I don't go, who will&ndash;  
   
**Euryale:**   
Asterios!?   
   
**Mash:**   
The ship...He's lifting it up!?   
   
**Drake:**   
We recovered! Okay! Drop all Barrel Bombs behind us!   
   
**Drake:**   
Drop 'em, drop 'em, drop 'em&mdash;  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Oooooou!? Wait there! I don't care about the old hag,but please leave Missy Euryale and the Holy Grail behind!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I don't want the old hag's body at all,so at least give me Missy Euryaleeeeeee!   
   
**Mary:**   
Our main objective is the Holy Grail, Captain. Euryale is just a bonus.   
   
**Anne:**   
Huhuhu, this captain isn't listening at all.   
   
**Drake:**   
You said you're Blackbeard, right? Someday! For sure! No matter what! At all costs!   
   
**Drake:**   
I'll take your head and tie it on my bow! Remember it, idiot! Dumbass! You...  
   
**Drake:**   
Oooh, I can't think of any more insults! In any case, I'll make sure to get revenge on youuuuuuu!   
   
## Section 6: Hunter of the Three Stars   
   
**Euryale:**   
Asterios! Where's Asterios? Fujimaru! Mash! Help me look for him, too!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Fou, fou! Kyuuuu!   
   
**Mash:**   
Fou found him! He'll bring him over!   
   
**Drake:**   
I'll help! Ugh, so heavy!   
   
**Asterios:**   
...Ugh...  
   
**Mash:**   
Don't worry, he's alive. But the wound he got during the battle against us opened up.   
   
**Euryale:**   
That's for being reckless before making a full recovery!   
   
**Euryale:**   
What kind of moron keeps swimming while carrying a galleon! You dummy!   
   
**Asterios:**   
...This kind...of...moron.   
   
**Euryale:**   
It's not something to brag about!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Did you forget your role of carrying me on your shoulders? Go on, clean your filthy body!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Mgh...  
   
**Mash:**   
Drake, how about the ship&ndash;  
   
**Drake:**   
It's no good. Nothing can make it budge.   
   
**Drake:**   
...Although I think we'll be able to fix the ship,thanks to Asterios bringing it to the coast.   
   
**Drake:**   
But we don't have enough materials. Looks like this island has a forest, so I guess we can make some lumber out of those trees.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Don't you think it's better to slay the forest monsters first? See, over there.   
   
**Mash:**   
Right. I'd like to reassess the situation.   
   
**Drake:**   
Oh boy, when we're done, I want to ask you something...How to sink that huge fool of a pirate!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Drake:**   
There wasn't much difference in the ships' performance. The issue was the thickness of their armor.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. Our cannons had no effect.... Doctor, please tell us about Blackbeard.   
   
**Mash:**   
I have some knowledge,but I'm sure that Chaldea has more accurate data.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Right, Blackbeard was a pirate born 100 years after Francis Drake.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
His real name was Edward Teach. He was one of the pirates who ruled over the Caribbean.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
His policy was simple. He would kill anyone who showed resistance but spared the rest.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Based in Nassau, he rampaged through these waters on his beloved ship, from Virginia to Honduras.   
   
**Mash:**   
His beloved ship...It had a name, right?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes. It was called "Queen Anne's Revenge. "He had 300 men on board.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He built up a large fleet centered around his flagship,and reigned as one of the strongest and worst pirates.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
However, he ended up losing his head.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Even a pirate as fearsome as him...Unbelievable...  
   
**Mash:**   
...Don't say any more. He's a Servant I'd rather not remember.   
   
**Euryale:**   
I erased the image of that thing from my brain. What? Has something happened?   
   
**Drake:**   
Yeah, pirates are all trashy, but he is the trashiest of them all. The King of Trash. That's what he is.   
   
**Drake:**   
Sorry, everybody. I apologize on behalf of all pirates.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're also a victim, Drake.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I know how you feel.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Drake:**   
Fujimaru...You're a good [♂ guy /♀ girl]...You'd be a great pirate!   
   
**Drake:**   
As a pirate, I can guarantee it!   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, are there any stories that could give us hints on his Noble Phantasm?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There are a few...Among them, I think his ship has the highest possibility of being a Noble Phantasm.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I was monitoring the magical energy levels during the battle, and his ship gave off the strongest readings.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Captain Drake's "Golden Hind" too. Maybe it's the Holy Grail, but it showed magical energy similar to a Noble Phantasm...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Even then, that ship was superior...  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou...  
   
**Drake:**   
Hmm...I don't quite understand,but are you saying that my ship is no match for his?   
   
**Mash:**   
It seems that way...  
   
**Drake:**   
Hmmm...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wait a second...Nothing happened before you blasted the ropes and made your escape?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Did you inflict any damage to their side&ndash;  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, at that time...I believe we defeated Eric Bloodaxe.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Right! Yes, we confirmed that he vanished completely on our end as well.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Ah, so that's it!   
   
**Mash:**   
What do you mean?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Simply put, Blackbeard's Noble Phantasm&ndash;is that ship, "Queen Anne's Revenge. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Maybe it's a Noble Phantasm that powers up as"his subordinates get stronger and stronger. "  
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The moment you guys defeated Eric, the magical energy surrounding the ship clearly weakened.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
After that, it stayed in that state until they lost sight of us.   
   
**Mash:**   
In other words&ndash;the more Servants it carries,the stronger it becomes?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
There were five Servants including Blackbeard on that ship. With Eric defeated, it's now four.   
   
**Mash:**   
Maybe the reason he sought Euryale...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...is because he gets stronger with her on board. His personal interests also play a part, of course...  
   
**Mash:**   
If only we could pull those Servants away somehow...But I'm sure it will be hard.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah, I've never encountered a hindrance like him before. He knows nothing and still disturbs our Holy Grail search!   
   
**Drake:**   
Well, we pirates are all like that. We take treasures from people, no matter how good they may be.   
   
**Mash:**   
...If it's hard to pull them away, we'll have to slay them.   
   
**Mash:**   
...And we better do it fast, before Blackbeard becomes even more powerful.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Offense is the best form of defense. Hmm? I'm picking up couple life signatures on that island.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Looks like they're wyverns, be careful!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Drake:**   
Oh, so this is a dragon? It really looks like a lizard!   
   
**Mash:**   
More precisely, a wyvern. We fought many during our battles in France.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Hmm?   
   
**Euryale:**   
Something the matter?   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh no, I just thought of something...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Use the dragons as materials.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Fix the ship with the dragons.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...That's it, Master!   
   
**Drake:**   
Huh? You're going to fix my ship with dragons?   
   
**Euryale:**   
...Oh, that's brilliant. If you process it,dragon scales are even harder than steel.   
   
**Euryale:**   
We need someone really strong to process it,but...  
   
**Asterios:**   
Uuugh...  
   
**Euryale:**   
Oh, you're here. Can you handle it?   
   
**Asterios:**   
Yes.   
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like it won't be a problem for Asterios. I'll try to strip their scales immediately!   
   
**Pirates:**   
Yeah, I feel reassured with this guy! But don't overdo it like before!   
   
**Pirates:**   
Hey, let's eat first! After that I'll let you meet our blacksmith!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Y&mdash;Ye-ah...We...eat food...together.   
   
**Drake:**   
Hmm...These scales are tough, but we still need more.   
   
**Mash:**   
Technical Director Leonardo. How many more wyverns do we need to slay to fix the ship?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Considering the size of the scale and how it shrinks while processing...I think 30 more wyverns should be enough.   
   
**Mash:**   
In that case, we should be able to do it in a day once we found a nest.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go hunting.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Then it is a quest.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
We make pretty good adventurers, right, Master?   
   
**Drake:**   
Hmmm, maybe I should change the ship's name to the "Golden Dragon"...  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**H：???:**  
...All right. Uh, chop that up...and add some spices, and sauté...  
   
**H：???:**  
Oh no,we need to add some vegetables too, right?   
   
**H：???:**  
Will that grass there do? There!   
   
**H：???:**  
Okay, now put it in that box...And stir...Done!   
   
**H：???:**  
Darling, I made you a boxed lunch!   
   
**E：???:**  
Wait. Do you even know how you made that?   
   
**E：???:**  
It's just grilled meat with some plucked weeds sprinkled on top, you can't call it a boxed lunch.   
   
**H：???:**  
Don't say that. Please try some? It's tasty, you know?   
   
**E：???:**  
How are you so confident in a boxed lunch with that kind of quality?   
   
**H：???:**  
You're asking so much, darling...What?   
   
**E：???:**  
Hmm...Something's coming. Looks like a Servant.   
   
**H：???:**  
Is it friend or foe?   
   
**E：???:**  
If she's cute, I don't care which side she's&ndash;  
   
**E：???:**  
No, it's nothing. Don't scrape me on this tree trunk! Owww!   
   
**H：???:**  
Actually, this is perfect. I'm getting bored of this island already.   
   
**H：???:**  
I don't even know why we were summoned here   
in the first place!   
   
**E：???:**  
Yes, you're right. Friend or foe, we need information.   
   
**H：???:**  
...Well, it's not like I want to leave or anything, though...  
   
**E：???:**  
Speak for yourself. These last two islands are way too boring.   
   
**H：???:**  
And there weren't any cute girls?   
   
**E：???:**  
No, there weren't.   
   
**E：???:**  
...I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.   
   
**E：???:**  
I forgot that I rely completely on you,and that I leech off you for everything.   
   
**E：???:**  
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please don't swing me arouuu&ndash;  
   
**H：???:**  
Ah...(slip)  
   
**E：???:**  
Wha&mdash;at&mdash;!   
   
**H：???:**  
Eek! Darling, I'm sorry!   
   
**E：???:**  
You think apologizing is enough?! You moron!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Be careful. I am picking up multiple wyverns. And...What is this?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's tiny. Maybe like a familiar...  
   
**Mash:**   
There's a familiar on an island like this?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmmm...Something different about it, though.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Looks like it doesn't have that much magical energy,so I don't think we need to be too concerned.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...Hmmm.   
   
**Asterios:**   
Huh?   
   
**Euryale:**   
It's nothing. I just had a bad feeling.   
   
**Euryale:**   
And, with your height, I'll be hitting my head on the tree branches.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Please, duck a little, or hold me in your arms.... Yes, that's way better.   
   
**Drake:**   
Geez...Comfy enough there, Princess?   
   
**Euryale:**   
Princess? I'm a goddess.   
   
**E：???:**  
Please, stop. Stop! Don't chew, don't chew please! Not food! Not food!   
   
**Mash:**   
Just now! I think I heard a voice...Master!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's rescue them.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's hurry.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes!   
   
**Mash:**   
Wyverns!   
   
**Drake:**   
Good timing, I'll turn you into materials!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
That's the last one. But, I thought I heard someone's voice earlier...  
   
**Drake:**   
I am not seeing the usual mess wyverns left behind,maybe they ran away?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? That weak magic response I mentioned...Seems like it's right near you.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Well? Can you find it?   
   
**Mash:**   
No, not really...  
   
**E：???:**  
Hrrrnngh!?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I think you stepped on something?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I heard a strange voice.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What? I stepped on something? Let's see...Could it be this?   
   
**Drake:**   
What is it? A plush toy? It sure is ugly. Even I can sew something better.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah, that's it. The magical energy I mentioned is coming from that thing.   
   
**Mash:**   
Is this the familiar you mentioned? ...Hmmm, it doesn't look like anything but a plush toy.   
   
**E：???:**  
Kyun kyun♪  
   
**Euryale:**   
...I can feel a really creepy gaze.   
   
**Mash:**   
Me too.   
   
**Drake:**   
What? You too? So I'm not the only one...  
   
**E：???:**  
...  
   
**Mash:**   
(Stare...)  
   
**Euryale:**   
(Stare...)  
   
**Drake:**   
(Stare...)  
   
**E：???:**  
...  
   
**Asterios:**   
Wah!   
   
**E：???:**  
Hyoo? What are you doing?   
   
**E：???:**  
...Oh.   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, Senpai. The unknown object is talking.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Talking plushies are rare.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I see, it does look pretty rare.   
   
**E：???:**  
I'm not a plush toy, okay? Though I do look like one. I'll admit that.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's dissect it.   
   
**Mash:**   
Dissect...You're right. That's a pretty good idea.   
   
**E：???:**  
No, it's not!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...It really talks. Are you friend or foe?   
   
**E：???:**  
&ndash;Huh? That's my line!   
   
**E：???:**  
...I'm sorry. I think we can be friends. We have no intention of harming you.   
   
**H：???:**  
Ah&mdash;!!   
   
**Mash:**   
...A Servant?   
   
**E：???:**  
Wait! They're not enemies...Pugyuru?!   
   
**H：???:**  
Did you cheat on me again, darling?! Despite! Having! ME!   
   
**H：???:**  
I'm at the limit of my patience! Come on, it is time to punish you!   
   
**E：???:**  
What? How am I the first to get hit? Wait! Wait! There's a misunderstanding!   
   
**E：???:**  
I really was staring at their breasts and legs, but...I'm sorr...Pugyuru!   
   
**Mash:**   
U-Um...  
   
**H：???:**  
What? Don't interfere in a lover's spat! It is a civil matter! Civil court!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, what do we do? This is the first time I feel at a loss.   
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, no...When we met that Black-whatever earlier,I felt like this too. One bad feeling after another.   
   
**Mash:**   
In this era,everyone has a few loose screws!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's your True Name?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What are you doing here?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**H：???:**  
Hmm? ...Wait, you're human? Are you a Master?   
   
**E：???:**  
Fujimaru...Right. Okay, finally we meet a respectable Servant.   
   
**E：???:**  
Let's see...This summon is for a Holy Grail War, right? Are we friend or foe? Is the busty girl single?   
   
**H：???:**  
Don't casually mix questions up!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We're here to fix this era.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're here to repair the world.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Orion:**   
...I see. Now I get what's going on, more or less.   
   
**H：???:**  
Huh...So this world is endless? Eternal?   
   
**Mash:**   
Even if this era is,I believe it will still vanish if its outer frame is gone.   
   
**Mash:**   
And if that happens, we'll be defeated,and human history will come to an end.   
   
**H：???:**  
Poo...  
   
**Orion:**   
Hey, you were thinking that you wanted to live in this world forever and stuff, weren't you?   
   
**H：???:**  
Oh! Guessing what's on my mind...It's like we're in love...How lovely...  
   
**Orion:**   
If I have to live in an eternal world,I'd prefer to die in the hell.   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, Senpai...  
   
**Mash:**   
Those two people...Or one person and one thing? There's something weird about their relationship...  
   
**H：???:**  
What is it? No matter how you look at it,Darling and I are the best couple of the Servant world.   
   
**Orion:**   
Hmm, from a third party viewpoint, it must look strange for a woman to be talking to a plush toy...  
   
**Mash:**   
I see, each person has their own tastes. That aside, could you help us?   
   
**H：???:**  
Hmm, what do you think, Darling?   
   
**Orion:**   
You ask what I think, but with humanity about to be exterminated. We have no choice but to help, idiot!   
   
**H：???:**  
I'm not an idiot! I'm a goddess!   
   
**Orion:**   
Quiet you useless goddess! (Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap! )  
   
**H：???:**  
Ah, it's DV! This is what you call domestic violence, right?   
   
**Euryale:**   
This is just too much, I can't see the end of it...  
   
**Drake:**   
...By the way...Lady Goddess. What's your name?   
   
**Artemis:**   
What? I'm Artemis.   
   
**Mash:**   
What!?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou?!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What?!   
   
**Euryale:**   
...  
   
**Asterios:**   
Uh?   
   
**Drake:**   
A super famous one just appeared...She doesn't seem to be faking it...What do we do?   
   
**Mash:**   
How about that plush toy right there?   
   
**Artemis:**   
He is my love, Orion.   
   
**Artemis:**   
...I knew that he was going to be summoned, and got worried so I came as his substitute!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I, I see...By lowering her divinity, it allows her to be summoned as a substitute Heroic Spirit...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's not like there aren't previous cases...  
   
**Orion:**   
I'm Orion. When I was summoned into this Holy Grail War, I got turned into a strange creature.   
   
**Orion:**   
...Strange creature...Strange...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I am crying.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Live strong.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Orion:**   
By the way, I'm infinitely close to useless. I can't live unless I totally depend on her for everything.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Hehe. You can depend on me even more, Darling.   
   
**Orion:**   
I want to be independent...  
   
**Mash:**   
Ahem.   
   
**Mash:**   
Then let's fight together. Artemis, Orion.   
   
**Mash:**   
Now, we need dragon's scales to fix our ship. Let's pool our strengths and gather them!   
   
**Orion:**   
Okay, this way...Dragon nests are usually hidden in bleak places like this.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Darling, so smart♪  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's just like Orion said. I am picking up multiple dragons nearby.   
   
**Mash:**   
Okay Servants. Let's go hunting!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Finally, we're halfway.   
   
**Drake:**   
So hot, so tired, so exhausted, need booze...  
   
**Euryale:**   
The captain is such a slacker.   
   
**Drake:**   
Well, you've been leaving everything to Asterios for a while now...  
   
**Euryale:**   
That's fine. I give orders, and he acts.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Hey, hey, Darling.   
   
**Orion:**   
What?   
   
**Artemis:**   
Are there male and female wyverns?   
   
**Orion:**   
They have parents, but I've never heard about gender.   
   
**Mash:**   
Parents?   
   
**Orion:**   
Yes. Their parents are not of the wyvern subspecies. Wyverns are born from their superior species, dragons.   
   
**Orion:**   
I guess they're more like minions than children.   
   
**Mash:**   
...So...For example...They are way bigger than wyverns?   
   
**Orion:**   
...Yeah. Indeed...  
   
**Mash:**   
And if we keep slaying their wyvern minions,they will become excited or angry?   
   
**Orion:**   
...Well, they probably won't forgive us...  
   
**Mash:**   
Master...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A boss battle is a given.   
   
**Mash:**   
I know nothing about such givens!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's apologize.   
   
**Mash:**   
If we apologize, will they forgive us?   
   
**Euryale:**   
The dragons basically think we declared war against them when we entered their territory in the first place.   
   
**Euryale:**   
It's useless. Go, fight now. Like a hero, do your best♪  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Understood. Mash Kyrielight&ndash;heading in!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
I've fought dragons before,but it never gets easier.   
   
**Orion:**   
Why do I have to take part in this?   
   
**Asterios:**   
Ugh.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Oh well, you have enough scales now, don't you? That was quite fun.   
   
**Euryale:**   
It's easy to sit back and see how things pan out,but it's also fun to see people struggle up close.   
   
**Drake:**   
Thanks for the god-like opinion. You sure got noticed by someone bizarre huh, big guy?   
   
**Asterios:**   
Ugh...  
   
## Section 7: Queen Anne's Revenge   
   
**Drake:**   
Improvements and repairs complete! We fixed the hole in the bilge. No leaks found.   
   
**Drake:**   
We also equipped the ram with the leftover scales. Things are going to get interesting.   
   
**Drake:**   
Now...Asterios! Time for your unrivaled strength and dauntless courage to step up!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Uh...Uhhh!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Looks like your wound has healed. You really are durable. Just like my loser sister.   
   
**Euryale:**   
All right, go for it!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Uuuuhhh&mdash;!   
   
**Pirates:**   
Whoaaaa! Incredible!   
   
**Pirates:**   
Damn, Asterios! There anything you can't do!? We all admire you...Uh, as men...  
   
**Asterios:**   
Ugh...Huh.   
   
**Drake:**   
All right, men! Time to take our revenge on Blackbeard! Don't worry, this time we'll be fine!   
   
**Drake:**   
Believe in me and follow me!   
   
**Artemis:**   
Hey Darling. Let's do that. The you-know-what.   
   
**Artemis:**   
That thing where I stand at the bow and extend both arms.   
   
**Orion:**   
Yep, you can do it. By yourself. Be careful of seagulls.   
   
**Artemis:**   
You won't hug me from behind? So cruel!   
   
**Orion:**   
Don't ask a plush toy for the impossible!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Hey Boss, what is that thing?   
   
**Drake:**   
It's a harmless creature. Just let it be. Fou is way cuter anyway.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**Mash:**   
Fou said, "Don't compare me to that. "  
   
**Drake:**   
Oh my...I'm sorry, Fou. Indeed, you have more class and flair.   
   
**Drake:**   
...All right, we're setting sail! Ring the bell!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Boss! I've already found a pirate ship!   
   
**Drake:**   
Let's take them down to liven things up!   
   
**Mash:**   
Roger that!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Drake:**   
We'll be entering unknown territory soon. We won't be able to use the Vikings' map anymore.   
   
**Drake:**   
It'll be an adventure, so that's fine! The problem is Blackbeard's ship.   
   
**Mash:**   
Even with just four Servants,it's still a formidable amount of enemies.   
   
**Mash:**   
If we make a bad approach,their guns and cannons will destroy our ship.   
   
**Drake:**   
We're way faster though. Should we use the ram to charge in?   
   
**Mash:**   
These seas don't seem to have many obstacles...We'll probably encounter them from afar like last time.   
   
**Mash:**   
If we were to have any chance, it would have to be during a Wild Hunt...  
   
**Mash:**   
They don't notice us, we notice them, and then a storm hits at the perfect time&ndash;  
   
**Drake:**   
That's wishing for too much, really.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...How about we shoot arrows before they notice us,to confuse them?   
   
**Mash:**   
They'll certainly be confused,but there are still Servants on their side.   
   
**Mash:**   
...That woman with the musket is especially problematic. If it turns into a gunfight, I don't think the confusion tactic will work.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Why doesn't someone board their ship and cause a riot before the ships collide?   
   
**Orion:**   
Are you stupid? How would someone board their ship before our ship...Oh.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Something wrong?   
   
**Artemis:**   
Heheh. I am a goddess. But...I was technically summoned as Orion.   
   
**Artemis:**   
So I have control over Orion's power.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ah, now I remember. Orion can walk on water.   
   
**Euryale:**   
You're the son of Lord Poseidon so you can walk on water...Wait, that's it?   
   
**Orion:**   
...Look, even I wish I had slightly cooler powers!   
   
**Orion:**   
I mean, walk on water? What am I, a water strider or something?   
   
**Artemis:**   
Aww, you're so cute when you're sad and gloomy! I just want to squeeze you tight! Squeeeeeeze...  
   
**Orion:**   
Mash, comfort me in your bosom!   
   
**Mash:**   
I refuse.   
   
**Orion:**   
Ngyuu...  
   
**Drake:**   
Anyway, we've been dealt a new card. Now, I have something to ask you guys...  
   
**Orion:**   
Great. I'm excited but have a bad feeling...  
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Woo-hoo-hoo! Heh, heh, heh...Hohohohoho...  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Gasp! Awww, once I wake up,my harem is nothing but a distant dream.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
The only ones here are our teacher and the yuri couple in their own little world.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...Well, I happen to like yuri myself. Since sleeping alone is so lonely (glance)  
   
**Mary:**   
&ndash;Incredible, Anne. This captain wants to sleep with us.   
   
**Anne:**   
For someone with zero popularity,or rather, negative popularity, that's rich.   
   
**Anne:**   
Actually, we didn't appear in your dreams, did we? If so, I'll just have to hit you with my gunstock till you forget.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Heh heh. So many heroines populate my dreams, I just don't remember.   
   
**Mary:**   
&ndash;Incredible, Anne. The captain has lumped us together as mob heroines.   
   
**Anne:**   
Yes♪ Let's kill him, after all♪  
   
**C：???:**  
...Huh? Hey Captain, your enemies are here. That Francis Drake.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Euryale-chan is here? And the Holy Grail, too!   
   
**C：???:**  
Most likely. I have to say,they're out for revenge a lot earlier than expected.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Yahoo! Prepare to receive them!   
   
**Mary:**   
Well, I guess we don't have a choice. Let's get to work.   
   
**Anne:**   
Yeah, you're right. But I'm pretty sure I opened a big hole in their bilge...What did they do?   
   
**C：???:**  
&ndash;What's more important is how they're coming back after such a severe beating.   
   
**C：???:**  
...They have something up their sleeve. But I have nothing to do with it.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Mmm? Are they planning to charge straight in without a plan?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
A reckless and self-destructive assault! Pretty unusual for that old hag.   
   
**Mary:**   
Not exactly, Captain. Isn't the one at the bow the Servant you're infatuated with?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Euryale-chan? What's this about my Euryale-chan? Bow! Is she at the bow?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Yay! Euryale-chan! Come spread your arms at the bow with me&mdash;  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Huh?   
   
**Euryale:**   
Tch, I missed. No, I feel like I missed on purpose.   
   
**Euryale:**   
I felt like my arrow would be soiled...  
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry, but can you try to aim and shoot him down? Your arrows are disposable. Deal with it.   
   
**Mash:**   
If we don't get him now, Captain Drake and I have to fight that Servant in close combat.   
   
**Euryale:**   
I know. But instead of hitting Blackbeard directly&ndash;  
   
**Euryale:**   
It's better if I hit someone else. That's how my "arrow" works.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Some of them are boarding our ship.   
   
**Euryale:**   
There aren't many, so let's defeat them quickly.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Hey comrades! If you get hit by Euryale-chan's arrows I'll kill you off immediately, so be careful!   
   
**Pirate:**   
...Huh? Captain, what on earth are you saying...  
   
**Pirate:**   
Ow?   
   
**Pirate:**   
...Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...Ohhhhh!   
   
**Pirate:**   
You scum...You scum! For Lady Euryale's sake...Die!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Huh? Captain, why did you...Ugh...Ah&mdash;  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
See, now your blood got my shirt all dirty. Remember,DEATH is what happens when you're careless!   
   
**Pirate:**   
A-Aye, aye, sir!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Missy Anne! Missy Anne!   
   
**Anne:**   
Please don't call to me in that creepy voice. What is it, Captain?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Gigigi. Say, why don't you go pew pew at them!   
   
**Anne:**   
If it wasn't for the disruption, I would have done so.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Countin' on ya♪  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Let's see...Don't tell me this is all you got, old hag-chan?   
   
**Drake:**   
&ndash;Of course not, pervert captain.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...Above!?   
   
**Artemis:**   
Hi♪  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
An angel...There is an angel here...There is an angel...But who are you?   
   
**Mary:**   
A Servant!?   
   
**Artemis:**   
I am Orion! I'll kill all of you☆  
   
**Pirate:**   
Ugh!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Gyah!   
   
**Mary:**   
I'll go! You keep shooting there, Anne!   
   
**Anne:**   
Gotcha!   
   
**Orion:**   
...Geez. They sure work their plush toys really hard. One, two. One, two. One, two.   
   
**Pirate:**   
We're almost in cannon range! Grab all reserve ammo from the arsenal!   
   
**Orion:**   
Sure, sure, show me where it is, please...  
   
**Artemis:**   
Hai, yaa! Take that!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Gyah!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Dammit! Missy Mary! I'm counting on you!   
   
**Mary:**   
You don't need to say it!   
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh human, I'd be troubled if you get too close to me.   
   
**Mary:**   
Figures. Since you're probably an Archer from the looks of it!   
   
**Artemis:**   
Exactly! Bye-bye now!   
   
**Mary:**   
Hey, wait!   
   
**Orion:**   
Artemis! Tell them we're ready!   
   
**Artemis:**   
Darling! Understood, Captain!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Drake:**   
All right! Helmsman, hard to starboard! Get a good angle! We'll rip through its belly with the ram!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Gotcha, Boss! Hard to starboard!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
What is that small thing.... That small thing...  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Oh...My...God! Everyone, hold on!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
It's gonna explooooooooooode!   
   
**Mary:**   
What?   
   
**Anne:**   
Explode?   
   
**C：???:**  
Ah, so that's what's going on! Dammit!   
   
**Pirate:**   
E-Explosions! In the ammo hold!   
   
**Artemis:**   
That went well, Darling!   
   
**Orion:**   
I-I thought I'd die down there! I lit the fuse and ran! Ran at full speed!   
   
**Mary:**   
You bastards&ndash;!   
   
**Artemis:**   
How rude. Fine, I'll play with you for a while.   
   
**Orion:**   
Don't play, shoot her down! ...Though, what a waste it will be.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Okay♪ Oh, and Darling, I'll punish you later☆  
   
**Pirate:**   
C-Captain! What should we do?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
C-C-C-Calm down! Everybody calm down! Extinguish the fire first! Now everybody strip down&ndash;  
   
**Anne:**   
Regain your sanity, Captain.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
W-W-W-W-What? I'm super sane, you know? More importantly, Missy Anne, take off your pants too&ndash;  
   
**Anne:**   
Next time you say that, I'll shoot.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I'm sane again! And I understand! Hard to starboard! Anyway, we have to get out of here!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Aye, aye!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...Oh, great. Looks like it's too late!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Huh?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
All hands, brace for impact! Bahahaha, I've always wanted to say that!   
   
**Mary:**   
It's the Golden Hind!   
   
**Anne:**   
Right! Both fast and sturdy!   
   
**Drake:**   
Prepare to board, my filthy scoundrels! Yes, yes! Let the plundering begin!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Uuuuuuuu!!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Asterios, go!   
   
**Mash:**   
Well, Master, can't keep Blackbeard waiting!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go, Mash!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's do it, Mash!   
   
  
---  
  
**--BATTLE--**  
   
## Section 8: Desperate Battle   
   
**Mary:**   
Haaaaaah!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Ugh!   
   
**Anne:**   
Mary, I'll join in!   
   
**Mary:**   
Okay!   
   
**Mash:**   
These two...combined, they're one Servant?   
   
**Mary:**   
My name is Mary Read.   
   
**Anne:**   
And I'm Anne Bonny.   
   
**Mash:**   
The legendary female pirates...No wonder their teamwork's sublime!   
   
**Mary:**   
...Interesting. So Heroic Spirits of Shield really do exist.   
   
**Anne:**   
They have many Servants on their side as well. Mary, for now, why don't we do the usual thing.   
   
**Mary:**   
&ndash;Okay. We haven't lost quite yet.   
   
**Mary:**   
If we can hold you off, we can win.... Let's go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mary:**   
...So we fell short. Sorry Captain, we're going on ahead.   
   
**Anne:**   
Captain. Please don't get depressed just because we're not around anymore.   
   
**Anne:**   
...Being a victor is all you're worth. If you lose,we're the ones who end up looking like fools.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Mmph! Then, Blackbeard's beard began shining like gold or silver or burning red, and he rose like a phoenix!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
At least emotionally!   
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh. This is discouraging...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't give up.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hang in there.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Even Master starts to sound unmotivational.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Backs against the wall, all is vanity, Glory to the Sutra. However!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I hate to brag, but this Blackbeard never even thought he could lose!   
   
**Drake:**   
Oh, look who's talking, you swine! Now this finally feels like a death-match!   
   
**Drake:**   
You and I, we're the same. A pair of heartless scoundrels who live our lives taking or saving lives!   
   
**Drake:**   
The loser is scum and the winner is justice! In that case,I'll trample your justice with my demonic heels!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Aww♪You're acting pretty cool for an old hag...  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
If I was a woman, I'm sure that right now there'd be romantic BGM playing with an event CG where I start stripping.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Such a bother to create backups and programming for that though...  
   
**Drake:**   
I seriously don't understand what you are saying at all...  
   
**Mash:**   
You don't need to understand. I guarantee that you'll never need that knowledge.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Well, anyway! Let's have our showdown, old hag!   
   
**Drake:**   
Insult me as much as you want.   
   
**Drake:**   
Now that I can punch you directly in the face&ndash;I'll laugh at your jokes.   
   
**Drake:**   
And when I finish with you, not even your mom can recognize you! Mash! Fujimaru!   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm on it. Let's go, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Ugh...Not yet...not yet...I'm...not even...at my full power...yet!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
If I really put my mind to it, there's no way I'd ever lose to a Servant or two...let alone the old hag!   
   
**Drake:**   
If you can blab like that after a fatal blow,you certainly got some guts.   
   
**Drake:**   
I don't respect you, but I am impressed. The great pirate born 100 years after me.   
   
**Drake:**   
I know you wanted the Holy Grail, but give up. That's my treasure.   
   
**Drake:**   
Treasures at sea have no rightful owners. "First come, first served" is our rule, right?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Yeah...That's right...Feels good...What a feel-good conclusion...That's how a pirate should be...  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Ugh!   
   
**Mash:**   
...What?   
   
**Drake:**   
Teach! Dammit, you...To your own comrade!?   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**F：???:**  
Well...You finally let your guard down, Captain.   
   
**F：???:**  
I mean, you act totally carefree, but wherever you are,you're always gripping your gun warily.   
   
**F：???:**  
This old man's really impressed.   
   
**F：???:**  
After all, a genius who acts like a moron is more trouble than a moron calling himself a genius.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...I see...So that's why...I couldn't read your true thoughts...  
   
**Blackbeard:**   
But betraying me under these circumstances? Mistah Hektor, are you an idiot?   
   
**Mash:**   
Hektor!?   
   
**Hektor:**   
Oh please, this old man's doing it knowing there's a fair chance to succeed.   
   
**Hektor:**   
All right Captain,I'll take your Holy Grail now!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Don't mock me!   
   
**Hektor:**   
Too bad, you missed. The Holy Grail...is mine!   
   
**Mash:**   
Is that...the Holy Grail!?   
   
**Mash:**   
Edward Teach was...the Singularity for this era?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I screwed up...  
   
**Hektor:**   
Now all that's left is...you. Francis Drake.   
   
**Hektor:**   
Sheesh. The plan was to let the Holy Grail fall into an idiot's hands, causing this era to fall apart.   
   
**Hektor:**   
I can't believe that a voyager who exists only to stop that would appear. The Naval Chart of Mankind sure walks on a tightrope.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Stop him, Mash!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Defeat him, Mash!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
I won't allow it!   
   
**Mash:**   
What?   
   
**Hektor:**   
Just kidding. I don't care about the correct Holy Grail.   
   
**Hektor:**   
My objective is...her.   
   
**Mash:**   
...The ship!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Eek!   
   
**Mash:**   
Euryale!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Hey, let me go!   
   
**Hektor:**   
Please behave.   
   
**Drake:**   
That means you were betraying Teach even before you boarded this ship?   
   
**Hektor:**   
Correct. I guess you can call me a Trojan Horse?   
   
**Hektor:**   
Granted, I've never seen the real thing.   
   
**Asterios:**   
Let her goooo!   
   
**Hektor:**   
...Whoa! You're a dangerous one!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Oh!   
   
**Hektor:**   
Minotaur&ndash;huh? A combination that is truly beauty and the beast.   
   
**Hektor:**   
Still...This old man hasn't fallen so far as to be defeated by an incompetent Berserker!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Asterios:**   
Ugh!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Asterios!   
   
**Hektor:**   
Tch! ...Hey now Captain, are you still alive?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Hee hee hee. It's the power of love! ...Just kidding. That was my final blow.   
   
**Hektor:**   
Tch! But, I've achieved my goal. Too bad, pirates.   
   
**Orion:**   
Dammit, he had a ship ready! Cheeky bastard!   
   
**Artemis:**   
Should we go after him, Darling? I'm sure we could   
   
**Orion:**   
We can't!   
   
**Artemis:**   
...Why not?   
   
**Orion:**   
Because right now,both you and I are Servants.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Hmph. So you think that I'd lose, Darling?   
   
**Orion:**   
That's a Lancer. On top of that, if he's Hektor then he's also, you know...  
   
**Orion:**   
The great hero of the Trojan War. The greatest conflict in which the gods of Olympus intervened.   
   
**Orion:**   
Even the omnipotent, invincible hero Achilles took many years to defeat him.   
   
**Orion:**   
If you were in your "true body" sure,but with my power as your base it's a bit much.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Hmph. Surprisingly calm.   
   
**Orion:**   
Not really. Everybody's mad right now. One of us has to be calm, or it's hopeless.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh, you're so cool! Darling! Embrace me! Do what you want with me!   
   
**Orion:**   
Like I said, don't ask the impossible from a plush toy!   
   
**Mash:**   
Blackbeard's subordinates...vanished.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They were created by Blackbeard's magical energy. Now that the Holy Grail is gone, they can't be maintained.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Even though he himself still looks full of energy.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Hey everybody, it's almost time to say goodbye! Don't you dare think you won, old hag, got that?   
   
**Drake:**   
Yeah, yeah. The more you talk, the more you sound like a sore loser.   
   
**Drake:**   
Hurry up and begone, Blackbeard. It must be hard for you to even breathe right now.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Damn you. You're being nice to me...Makes my heart flutter.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I'd say, "Marry me, I'll make you happy"...I mean, you've been single ever since you were born, no?   
   
**Drake:**   
I've had enough of you nitwit! Hurry up and kick the bucket!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Hahaha, what a nice insult!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Now that I'm satisfied, it's time to die! But this time I won't be beheaded.   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Because I am the greatest pirate after all! I am a merry pirate, and I will die as one!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
I regret that I wasn't able to create my harem,but I still had fun. I approve!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
...Oh, old hag. Don't you need a story route where I revive as a rival?   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Wouldn't it be great if I revived with a line like"It's been decided, I'm the one who defeats you! " or something?   
   
**Drake:**   
...Not needed, useless. Come on, snuff it.   
   
**Drake:**   
Mash told me about your final moments. Make sure to take that head with you!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Okay, well that's all fine! Hah, that's all dandy and fine! Fandy and dine!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
The woman who Blackbeard respected most! The pirate who he yearned for most!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
She is present at Blackbeard's deathbed,and he keeps his head intact!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
Then, farewell humanity! Farewell pirates!   
   
**Blackbeard:**   
And so Blackbeard draws his last breath! Haha! Ahahahaha!   
   
**Drake:**   
Hurry up and die, Edward. In the end, both you and I are headed to hell.   
   
**Drake:**   
Why don't we pay for our misdeeds with disgrace and shame like true pirates?   
   
**Mash:**   
...The ship will collapse. Let's go back!   
   
**Mash:**   
Come, Asterios. Hold onto me.   
   
**Asterios:**   
Ugh...Eu...ry...ale...  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
## Section 9: Tracks Down the Dandies   
   
**E：???:**  
Excuse me. I'm coming in, Master.   
   
**F：???:**  
Hey, what's going on? My beloved!   
   
**E：???:**  
Lord Hektor contacted us. It seems he caught Euryale.   
   
**F：???:**  
I see! I see, I see, I see! All right!   
   
**F：???:**  
We were told, if we offer up Euryale,we can obtain even more power.   
   
**F：???:**  
Me! I'll be more powerful than anyone. I'll be invincible! Wouldn't that be amazing?   
   
**E：???:**  
Yes, very. I think that would be extremely amazing, Master.   
   
**F：???:**  
I like your smile. Your smile is like the sun. It never fails to enrich my heart.   
   
**F：???:**  
Oh, but you seem a little tired. Are you all right?   
   
**F：???:**  
You've been the ship's power source for so long. I want you to tell me when it gets too hard.   
   
**F：???:**  
See. Just a bit. If it is just a bit,I can think about letting you rest.   
   
**E：???:**  
T-Thank you very much! But it's fine. Your words alone are enough for me to go on.   
   
**F：???:**  
Perfect&mdash;yes. That's how you should be. The woman who will become my lovely wife.   
   
**F：???:**  
As soon as Hektor returns,let's go search for "you-know-what. "  
   
**F：???:**  
I mean, where the hell is it? You still haven't received any oracle?   
   
**E：???:**  
Correct. I assume that as soon as Lord Hektor returns,I will receive an oracle showing where we must go.   
   
**F：???:**  
What's with all these problems...They always keep dragging me down...  
   
**F：???:**  
Ah, I'm really sorry. I don't mean to blame them.   
   
**F：???:**  
But, I have the right to receive these oracles too. Why is it only you&ndash;?   
   
**E：???:**  
...? What is it, Master?   
   
**F：???:**  
...Nothing. Haste makes waste I guess.   
   
**F：???:**  
That's right, that must be it. For now, I'll believe in your oracles, and do my best as the captain.   
   
**E：???:**  
Yes, that is what we hope. Let's go welcome Lord Hektor.   
   
**E：???:**  
We members of Argonautai are undefeatable heroes. There is no way a random group like theirs can win.   
   
**F：???:**  
Yes, you're right! We are the strongest! There is no mistake. Our strength is unparalleled!   
   
**F：???:**  
We have the world's greatest, strongest hero, and witch on our side! Oh, and there's one useless woman, too.   
   
**F：???:**  
Hmph, to think someone would vow chastity to someone like Artemis and reject my invitation like that.   
   
**F：???:**  
Should be a shark's meal by now. Serves her right.   
   
**F：???:**  
Now, everybody! Prepare to depart!   
   
**F：???:**  
We shall obtain the "Ark. " Even the golden ram pales in comparison to this treasure.   
   
**F：???:**  
With the Holy Grail and the "Ark,"I will reign as the king of Okeanos!   
   
**Drake:**   
Full speed ahead! Hey, lookout! Pay close attention to what's ahead!   
   
**Drake:**   
Once you see that ship, call out!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Aye, aye, Boss!   
   
**Drake:**   
...That tiny ship is faster than it looks.   
   
**Drake:**   
With their head start, unless they stop,we might not catch up...  
   
**Asterios:**   
Uh, uuh...  
   
**Mash:**   
Don't worry, she won't die.   
   
**Asterios:**   
Eu...ryale...I...will...save you.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I understand how you feel. But for now, concentrate on healing your wounds.   
   
**Asterios:**   
No!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll save her.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'll help too.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
......  
   
**Asterios:**   
Do...You...Promise?   
   
**Mash:**   
Of course. Drake is sailing the ship at top speed with that very same thought.   
   
**Asterios:**   
...Uh.   
   
**Pirate:**   
Boss! A pirate ship's headed our way!   
   
**Drake:**   
Damn, at a time like this!?   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, let's take them out quickly.   
   
**Asterios:**   
...Crush!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Master...I'm sure Blackbeard said "Hektor. "  
   
**Mash:**   
If that's the case, then that spear is the sword "Durandal," later inherited by Roland, one of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne.   
   
**Mash:**   
Or rather, the base for that sword.   
   
**Mash:**   
It's a miracle that Asterios didn't die. That's how powerful that spear was.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But I wonder what Hektor plans to do,with Euryale.   
   
**Drake:**   
Human trafficking...No, it can't be.   
   
**Orion:**   
...But he sounded like he had a clear goal in his mind from the beginning.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. From the start, Servant Hektor had his eye on Mistah Blackbeard's Holy Grail.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Blackbeard seemed wary of that.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Mash, why "Mistah"...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I can understand the Holy Grail,but why Euryale?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's not about bolstering forces. Euryale herself isn't that powerful of a Servant.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I think what makes her special is the fact that she IS a Servant.   
   
**Drake:**   
What? What do you mean?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Actually, in the past, we met "another" her...No, maybe her...Big sister, perhaps?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyway, we met a girl summoned as a Servant despite being a goddess.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Euryale is not a hero,nor is she someone whose name is engraved into history.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
She was treated as a goddess in Greek mythology. "The one who flies far"&ndash;that is Euryale.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Or she was a monster. The middle sister of&ndash;the three Gorgons.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The youngest is the famous Medusa,I can see her being summoned into a Holy Grail War.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But, not Euryale. She is just a goddess,an idol of ideals, and undoubtedly weak.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
For her to be summoned as a Servant is a strange phenomenon.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Though some other Servants are just as peculiar.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Usually it's hard for Divine Spirits to become Servants. Unless there is a really special case.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In addition, a pure god becoming a Servant is something that isn't supposed to happen in the world of Magecraft.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Really? Who's like that?   
   
**Orion:**   
Us, take the hint.   
   
**Drake:**   
Basically what you're saying is, Euryale isn't good enough to be kidnapped for her fighting prowess?   
   
**Asterios:**   
...  
   
**Drake:**   
Well, that's not a reason for us not to save her. Plus, she's a great singer.   
   
**Drake:**   
I like great singers. It is a very important role for sailors, right men?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Aye! It heals our rotten heart!   
   
**Drake:**   
There ya go. . Don't worry, big guy. Nobody on this ship wants to abandon that girl.   
   
**Asterios:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong, Mash?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is something the matter?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...No. Captain Drake's personality is just very complicated.   
   
**Mash:**   
...It's hard to explain, but she reminds me of you. Facing difficulties. Helping those around her.   
   
**Mash:**   
It is an advantage, a merit, that humans possess. But why&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
Is Francis Drake a villain? As she is now, and back in history.   
   
**Mash:**   
She is such a good person, but her actions are that of an outlaw.   
   
**Mash:**   
I can't understand this contradiction well&mdash;  
   
**Drake:**   
Ah, dammit. It had to happen in a time like this!   
   
**Drake:**   
Everybody tie yourself to the ship! There's a storm coming!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Pirate:**   
What should we do, Boss?   
   
**Drake:**   
Shut up, I'm thinking! Um...The distance between us and that ship is about this much...  
   
**Drake:**   
This storm has a small range...Perhaps...Depending on distance, it'll be a tailwind for them...  
   
**Drake:**   
...The ship's armor is...Oh, that's right. Since we used THAT for repairs...  
   
**Drake:**   
All right!   
   
**Drake:**   
You guys! Good news and bad news, which do you want first?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Let's see. Bad news first...  
   
**Drake:**   
All right.   
   
**Drake:**   
This Hektor guy who kidnapped Euryale probably won't be affected by this storm!   
   
**Drake:**   
If we sit tight, he'll probably pull so far away that we'll never catch up!   
   
**Pirate:**   
...Um. So what's the good news?   
   
**Drake:**   
Rejoice, guys! We're gonna raise all sails to and cruise at top speed in this storm!   
   
**Drake:**   
Let's have another exciting ride through the seas!   
   
**Pirate:**   
How is that good news!?   
   
**Drake:**   
Shut up or you'll get the boot! Anyways, get moving!   
   
**Drake:**   
Mash, Asterios, and Lady Artemis,please help us too!   
   
**Drake:**   
...Of course Fujimaru, too. Okay, let's go!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master...L-Let's do our best!   
   
**Drake:**   
Come on, keep going!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Boss! Our ship won't last much more!   
   
**Drake:**   
Really? But it is pretty stable, isn't it?   
   
**Pirate:**   
What? ...Now that you mention it, indeed...  
   
**Drake:**   
Did you forget? We used a bunch of dragon scales when we repaired this ship.   
   
**Drake:**   
It'll take more than this to sink us! This is no sailboat!   
   
**Drake:**   
Got that? Now, charge forth!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Boss, there's a ship up ahead!   
   
**Drake:**   
Did we catch up!?   
   
**Pirate:**   
It's not them. That ship is bigger than ours!   
   
**Drake:**   
It's similar to Blackbeard's ship!?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Yes, but&ndash;  
   
**Drake:**   
But?   
   
**Pirate:**   
It looks pretty beat up. That's all I can tell in this storm!   
   
**Drake:**   
Give me the telescope!   
   
**Drake:**   
Mm-hmm.... What is that, a ghost ship?   
   
**Mash:**   
A ghost ship?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Wow, it's even more like an ocean adventure novel now! So much excitement, I want to turn this into a book!   
   
**Drake:**   
Hah, ghost ships are usually just vessels that were abandoned for things like mutiny and starvation.   
   
**Drake:**   
...Hmm? Some light...is headed this way...Eek!?   
   
**Orion:**   
Drake made a really strange sound just now!   
   
**Artemis:**   
Her voice was like a maiden's!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master!?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh, what?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's wrong?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Nothing, I just was shocked by Drake's voice. What happened, Drake?   
   
**Drake:**   
F-Forget about my scream, look to the bow! Enemy attack! Ghosts are attacking us!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Drake:**   
Ugh...Thank goodness we beat them...  
   
**Mash:**   
Drake, are you afraid of ghosts?   
   
**Drake:**   
Can't a pirate be superstitious!?   
   
**Mash:**   
S-Sure. There's no problem. Sorry.   
   
**Drake:**   
All right, the storm is winding down. Hang on just a little more.   
   
**Drake:**   
Let's go!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Hektor:**   
Now, according to my calculations, it's almost time.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...Why me? Does your Master have the same tastes as Blackbeard?   
   
**Hektor:**   
Oh no, my boss may be a worthless womanizer,but he's not brave enough to hit on a goddess like you.   
   
**Hektor:**   
Let's just say your very existence is important.   
   
**Hektor:**   
Even if you've fallen to the level of a Servant,Divine Spirits normally don't appear in this world.   
   
**Hektor:**   
...So, now that you've appeared,it'd be a waste not to use you, right?   
   
**Euryale:**   
As a Divine Spirit, I'm low-tier, you know?   
   
**Hektor:**   
They're probably not expecting any combat skills from a goddess like you.   
   
**Hektor:**   
"Offer a god as a sacrifice. "This is the only thing we expect from you.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Oh? Offer to whom?   
   
**Hektor:**   
To the world. We can't tolerate being part of an endless spiral.   
   
**Hektor:**   
Even if we take a little risk,we have to blow this world to pieces.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...Who do you serve, exactly?   
   
**Hektor:**   
Mm...That's a good question. Who do you think this old man is serving!?   
   
**Euryale:**   
...In any case, asserting principles of anarchy is sure to meet interference in the end.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Honestly, whether or not they'll come is like fifty-fifty.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...Hmph, it must have been because Asterios was there.   
   
**Hektor:**   
What? That is "the Golden Hind! "  
   
**Drake:**   
Okay, we caught up. Can't waste anymore time, let's ram into them!   
   
**Drake:**   
Are you ready, guys!?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Yup!   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes!   
   
**Drake:**   
Good! Let's land a hard one on that guy!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, we are ready to fight too.   
   
**Orion:**   
Hey, Asterios! Calm down, calm down! Relax, please!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Euryale!   
   
**Artemis:**   
Nope, no good. Can I let him go?   
   
**Orion:**   
Letting him go now is like painting a target for that spear. Come, there there. Now, there there.   
   
**Asterios:**   
Uhhh!   
   
**Orion:**   
Fine! I got it! Wait 10 more seconds. 10, 1, 0!   
   
**Artemis:**   
You cut corners, Darling!   
   
**Orion:**   
Thinking rationally, there was no way a plush toy could stop a Berserker...  
   
**Artemis:**   
You should've realized that sooner!   
   
**Mash:**   
Asterios!? I-I will go with him!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's rescue Euryale!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's help Asterios!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes!   
   
**Hektor:**   
Geez, what a pain in the ass. Oh, brother&ndash;But this old man...  
   
**Hektor:**   
Is really good at defense to the point even I hate it!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
These pirates are way more tenacious than before!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Give...Baaaaaaaaaaack!   
   
**Hektor:**   
Geez, that damned Minotaur! Fine, I'll give her back!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Aughh!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Eu...  
   
**Hektor:**   
Nothing like the predictability of a Berserker!   
   
**Mash:**   
I won't let you&ndash;!   
   
**Hektor:**   
Demi-Servant!   
   
**Mash:**   
Hero Hektor&mdash;who do you serve, and what are you after...I'll have you tell me!   
   
**Hektor:**   
Huh. Pretty interesting, little girl. This old man would rather not take a young life...  
   
**Hektor:**   
But the world is cruel like that. Let me show you what that truly means!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Hektor:**   
Tch, she's surprisingly tough! That's why I can't stand heroes with shields!   
   
**Mash:**   
Haaa!   
   
**Hektor:**   
&ndash;Well, this old man won through persistence. Dear me, I'm tired, so tired.   
   
**Pirate:**   
Boss! A ship up ahead! I-It's a ship that I've never seen before!   
   
**Drake:**   
Did you say a ship that you've never seen before?!   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Hektor:**   
Yes, thanks for that! My current "superior" is on that ship.   
   
**Asterios:**   
Oh...Uh!   
   
**Hektor:**   
Now, time for the counterattack. This old man's gonna be serious about it now, yeah?   
   
## Section 10: World's Oldest Pirate Ship   
   
**Pirate:**   
Boss! They're approaching!   
   
**Drake:**   
Cannons ready! Fire!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Not good, it didn't do anything! They deflected every single cannonball!   
   
**Drake:**   
Ugh, each and every one! Hmm. You know what?   
   
**Drake:**   
If we wanna burn down a ship, we should just ram our own burning ship into them, yeah?   
   
**F：???:**  
&ndash;All right, found them. Okay, Heracles.   
   
**F：???:**  
Let's send those scrappy masses gathered there a hearty greeting.   
   
**Mash:**   
What? They threw a boulder?   
   
**Asterios:**   
Move...away!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Nuaaaah!!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Asterios!   
   
**F：???:**  
Hahaha! He managed to barely catch it! That barbarian over there...  
   
**F：???:**  
What is that? Is it a werebeast?   
   
**E：???:**  
Oh, that's probably Lord Asterios. Otherwise known as the Minotaur.   
   
**E：???:**  
The tragic child born from the union of a divine bull and a human.   
   
**F：???:**  
So, a poorly created human! A comical creature fated to be defeated by a hero!   
   
**F：???:**  
The're really short on talent aren't they? Hahahaha!   
   
**F：???:**  
Hektor! You seem to be in trouble. Need help?   
   
**Hektor:**   
...Yes, Captain. I'm so sorry. Could you help?   
   
**F：???:**  
No problem, Hektor! The goddess is there? And you have the Holy Grail?   
   
**F：???:**  
Then all is well.   
   
**F：???:**  
While we're at it,let's settle the score once and for all!   
   
**F：???:**  
You, the evildoers trying to "correct" the world...And us, the heroes trying to make it right!   
   
**F：???:**  
A suitable finale for the Holy Grail War!   
   
**Hektor:**   
Then, this old man will take this opportunity&ndash;  
   
**Artemis:**   
Ah, he jumped and ran away.   
   
**Orion:**   
Let that old guy go. The problem we have here is more important.   
   
**Pirate:**   
I won't let you go!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, let's defeat the remaining enemies first. We have to hurry!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Artemis:**   
Ohhh. Is that the Argo, by any chance?   
   
**Mash:**   
The Argo? Is it possible?   
   
**Mash:**   
Orion, by the Argo,do you mean "the" Argo!?   
   
**Orion:**   
Yeah, you got it right, dammit. Those are the real "Argonauts! "  
   
**Orion:**   
The ship of adventurers who set sail seeking the Golden Fleece. Likely mankind's first and strongest pirates.   
   
**Orion:**   
Though unlike our brabuster, generous, big-sisterly, tigbits Captain, their captain will make you think lice have better personalities.   
   
**Mash:**   
The leader of the Argonauts...Jason.   
   
**Asterios:**   
Ja-so-n!   
   
**Jason:**   
So disrespectful, Minotaur. My name should be called with awe and worship!   
   
**Jason:**   
But, as you are an ugly monster fated for death,I shall grant you forgiveness.   
   
**Jason:**   
Now, come at me!   
   
**Hektor:**   
What do we do, Captain? Should we crush them here and now?   
   
**Jason:**   
Of course, just like heroes of justice. We will fight and win head-on!   
   
**Jason:**   
Indeed, justice makes me feel so good!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I recommend you withdraw. It's impossible. Since we already have Euryale, it's better to retreat.   
   
**Mash:**   
But, Doctor!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Powerful heroes were gathered as Argonauts, but...There is one exceptional hero among them...  
   
**Mash:**   
...I know. That Berserker, presumably...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes. The greatest hero of Greek mythology. He who overcame the Twelve Labors. &ndash;Heracles.   
   
**Heracles:**   
  
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Jason:**   
You can't win! As if you could! Heracles traveled everywhere, fought every monster.   
   
**Jason:**   
He was undefeated, and ultimately rose to become a god!   
   
**Jason:**   
He's not like you second and third-raters. You trash mobs are fated to be ripped to shreds!   
   
**Jason:**   
Of course, as a summoned Servant,he does lack two things.   
   
**Jason:**   
Intelligence and dignity. He's just a vicious stray dog now. Serves him right, I'd say.   
   
**Jason:**   
Now...Hand over Euryale.   
   
**Jason:**   
...If you do, I'll stop sending Heracles to attack you.   
   
**Jason:**   
What do you say, you Master-ish entity?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I refuse.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Shut up.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
Master!   
   
**Jason:**   
Haha! I see, I see!   
   
**Jason:**   
You are very courageous! I really, really, really like you!   
   
**Jason:**   
And you have such a cute Servant, too! Good, very good! You're just like a hero!   
   
**Jason:**   
Wooo! So cool!   
   
**Jason:**   
&ndash;Geez, so cocky for the likes of trash. Can you perish now, Servants and all?   
   
**Jason:**   
Medea! My beloved Medea!   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Yes. Are you calling me, Master?   
   
**Jason:**   
You know what I want, right? I want you to kill them and break them into tiny pieces!   
   
**Jason:**   
Just like you did to your little brother! Ah, it's fine, it's fine.   
   
**Jason:**   
I already repented! I will never betray you again!   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Little brother, in pieces? Sometimes you say strange things, Master.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
But that's right, Lord Jason was like this. Now, you are like this.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
That's why details don't matter. I'm the first disciple of Hekate, goddess of Magecraft&mdash;  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Princess Medea will make your desires come true.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh, I know this. It is called DV.   
   
**Orion:**   
It's worse than DV. Neither of the two are looking at their partner!   
   
**Jason:**   
And Heracles! You shall go too! I'll be looking after you two from here.   
   
**Mash:**   
...He sends his wife to the front line, but doesn't fight himself. Um, Master. Maybe he is...  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The scum of mankind.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A trivial boss.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Jason:**   
Hah, that's a funny joke.... Kill them all, Heracles!   
   
**Orion:**   
To think there's someone even scummier than me. This world is so big, and Greece is so tiny.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Look at their numbers with just the Dragon Tooth Warriors...  
   
**Artemis:**   
Familiars created from dragon fangs...That's Hekate's specialty, all right!   
   
**Orion:**   
That sparkly kid,is that really Medea?   
   
**Orion:**   
That's weird...I thought Medea would look more, like...Ill-fated, or maybe gloomy...  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I still have a lot of materials. Will your ship sink from the Dragon Tooth Soldiers' weight before you are defeated?   
   
**Drake:**   
Take that! You're so damn annoying! Get lost!   
   
**Drake:**   
Euryale! It's you they're after! Stay with Asterios!   
   
**Euryale:**   
But...  
   
**Asterios:**   
Rest...assured...  
   
**Euryale:**   
I can't do that! Stand back...Wait, are you getting in my way!?   
   
**Mash:**   
The second wave is coming!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
So they have strong bodies and minds. All right, I'll go too, Master.   
   
**Jason:**   
Yes, I'm counting on you, my Medea. Although Heracles alone is enough, with you victory is assured.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Here she comes. Princess Medea, a mage known as a"witch" even in Greece, where Magecraft was mainstream!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
The Witch of Colchis, whose skills rank among the top five in the world!   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I will offer everything, dispose of everything,and sacrifice everything.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Even without reward, even gaining nothing. That is the reason I left the island.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Prepare yourselves, everyone!   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I'm not the best at fighting,so please forgive me if I make you suffer...  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Impressive. Just what you'd expect of someone who's already crushed two "eras. "  
   
**Fou:**   
...Fou!   
   
**Mash:**   
At this rate, we'll make it somehow!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Thank goodness she really is a lousy fighter! But the problem is the other one!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I'm sorry, I can't take them down by myself. Heracles&ndash;it's your turn, brave one.   
   
**Heracles:**   
  
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Don't...Leave...My...Side!   
   
**Euryale:**   
What are you saying? Of course I'd flee without hesitation.   
   
**Euryale:**   
That's Heracles, the strongest hero in the history of mankind. He's like a walking disaster.   
   
**Euryale:**   
A man who walks into an avalanche is no hero. He's just a dimwit.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...I've seen many dimwits.   
   
**Asterios:**   
...I...know.   
   
**Euryale:**   
In that case&ndash;  
   
**Asterios:**   
But...if...somebody...needs...to. Then...I...will...Because.   
   
**Asterios:**   
I...am...monster. Killed...many...children. Many...Many...Many...Many!   
   
**Asterios:**   
So...I...will...go! I...Fight!   
   
**Mash:**   
...They're coming!   
   
**Asterios:**   
You...Won't...Have...Her!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Asterios:**   
Ugh...uh...aaaaaaaaaaargh!   
   
**Heracles:**   
  
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)   
   
**Mash:**   
Did we defeat him?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No, it's no good! I'm still picking up a reaction!   
   
**Jason:**   
Oh, effort, effort, so much effort! So, I've got some news for you guys!   
   
**Jason:**   
&ndash;About Heracles...He's immortal.   
   
**Mash:**   
What?   
   
**Jason:**   
Heracles' most famous legend. The Twelve Labors given by the gods.   
   
**Jason:**   
Since he's overcome them all,he's been granted that many lives as a reward.   
   
**Jason:**   
In other words, you have to defeat him eleven more times. Good luck!   
   
**Mash:**   
No way...Eleven times...For real?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I-Impossible. That is just cheating!   
   
**Drake:**   
...Retreat! Everyone, retreat! Come on, back to the ship!   
   
**Jason:**   
Hahahahaha! Great! This is the best! Using overwhelming violence to oust enemies!   
   
**Jason:**   
This is the real pleasure behind "justice! "Don't you agree, Hektor?   
   
**Hektor:**   
Hmm...well, at least Heracles makes it nice and easy. Ah, and here's the Holy Grail.   
   
**Jason:**   
Oh, so this is the Holy Grail. Well, I suppose this is sufficient to be king of this world.   
   
**Jason:**   
I only regret that the previous owner was a lowly pirate. Now all I need is Euryale and&ndash;"the Ark. "  
   
**Jason:**   
Then I'll have everything I need!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**Mash:**   
Ark?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Did he say "the Ark"!?   
   
**Hektor:**   
Captain, you sure it's okay to disclose that?   
   
**Jason:**   
It's fine, Hektor! They wouldn't have the slightest clue!   
   
**Jason:**   
Not of this world! Not of this era! Not of our true intentions...Nothing!   
   
**Hektor:**   
...Well, I think the lack of understanding is mutual.   
   
**Jason:**   
Now, Heracles! Finish them off!   
   
**Heracles:**   
  
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)   
   
**Mash:**   
Ugh!   
   
**Asterios:**   
!!!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Augh!   
   
**Drake:**   
Crap!   
   
**Heracles:**   
  
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)   
   
**Euryale:**   
&ndash;Oh, this is not good.   
   
**Jason:**   
!? No way! Knock it off, Heracles!   
   
**Jason:**   
This will wreck all my plans! Don't kill that woman!   
   
**Asterios:**   
!!!   
   
**Euryale:**   
!!!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Asterios&ndash;!?   
   
**Asterios:**   
Ugh...GRRRRRRRRRRR!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Asterios...it's no good now. We're no match! We can't win against him!   
   
**Euryale:**   
It's no good. It's no good, but why...Asterios!   
   
**Asterios:**   
!!! ...Ugh!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Kill-ed. Killed...killed...killed! Killed...innocent...children!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Father...told me...to...do it. Father...called me...monster!   
   
**Asterios:**   
But...it...was...my fault. I was sure...my heart was...monster.   
   
**Asterios:**   
But...you...called my name. Everyone forgot...my...name!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Then...I need to...return. Even if I'm not forgiven...Even if I'm still ugly...  
   
**Asterios:**   
I need to...return to human!   
   
**Asterios:**   
...Ugh!   
   
**Jason:**   
Quite considerate of you, Ox-head! Medea! Go retrieve Euryale!   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Yes. Just what you'd expect of the Minotaur. Though only once, he ultimately pushed Heracles back.   
   
**Drake:**   
Don't you dare...  
   
**Drake:**   
Come over here, Euryale!   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
???Why go so far to protect her? You're a pirate knowing no love nor romance, only desire, so why?   
   
**Drake:**   
Hah! You don't understand? I may be inhuman, but this girl's beauty is true!   
   
**Drake:**   
Her soul is especially beautiful. She's not blind like you. It's obvious we would protect her!   
   
**Drake:**   
Euryale is our treasure! I won't let a guy like that get even a hair from her head!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Drake!   
   
**Mash:**   
Euryale, please stand back! You're the one they're after!   
   
**Jason:**   
What are you doing, Heracles? Medea?   
   
**Jason:**   
Oh, dammit! Why is everyone else but me a hopeless imbecile?   
   
**Jason:**   
Heracles, finish off that ox-man! But don't lay a hand on Euryale!   
   
**Heracles:**   
  
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)   
   
**Asterios:**   
Ugh...uh!   
   
**Jason:**   
You can't even obey me now, you  piece of scum? U-Ugh&mdash;Whew...Hektor!   
   
**Hektor:**   
Yessir.... Time to do it?   
   
**Jason:**   
...Yes. When things don't go exactly as I plan,it irritates me.   
   
**Jason:**   
I can't stand my own allies' disorderly conduct. If you can't follow orders, you're worse than the enemy.   
   
**Hektor:**   
Gotcha. ThenReleasing Noble Phantasm.   
   
**Orion:**   
Oh, this doesn't look good. Asterios, dodge it!   
   
**Asterios:**   
...No. I can't...handle...that one.   
   
**Hektor:**   
If you want to stop this, you should bring either Achilles'or Aias' shield! "Durindana Pilum"!   
   
**Hektor:**   
...What?   
   
**Euryale:**   
No! Asterios!   
   
**Heracles:**   
  
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)   
   
**Jason:**   
Good job, Hektor! That damn ox-head is going to hell along with Heracles!   
   
**Jason:**   
But, Heracles will revive immediately. Now, quickly get up and grab Euryale!   
   
**Jason:**   
You died once, and ox-head also died! You should have come to your senses a little bit!   
   
**Hektor:**   
Oh no.... I don't think that's gonna happen, Captain.   
   
**Hektor:**   
That bastard Asterios is still "alive. "  
   
**Jason:**   
W-What!?   
   
**Hektor:**   
...Amazing. He's the enemy, but I'm impressed.   
   
**Hektor:**   
He clung onto Heracles,fully aware that the spear would pierce through his body.   
   
**Hektor:**   
By doing so, my spear becomes a chain,and ties Heracles down.   
   
**Hektor:**   
He really wants to let Euryale escape,even if it means receiving a fatal blow.   
   
**Asterios:**   
...Mas-ter! Master! Master! MASTER!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...We're retreating!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Asterios:**   
Y-Yes! Thank...you!   
   
**Asterios:**   
Master...you too...called my name! Everyone...did not hate...monster!   
   
**Asterios:**   
First time...For the first time! I was...happy!   
   
**Asterios:**   
I am happy...to be...born!   
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;  
   
**Asterios:**   
Take care of...Euryale! All...thanks to...Euryale&mdash;  
   
**Asterios:**   
I...love...Euryale!   
   
**Drake:**   
We're setting sail! Fire all the smoke bombs we have on hand!   
   
**Euryale:**   
You can't. Asterios is&ndash;  
   
**Orion:**   
Shut up, tiny goddess! Try to understand his feelings!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Asterios!   
   
**Euryale:**   
No matter what anyone says,you're Asterios and nobody else.   
   
**Euryale:**   
And so&ndash;I beg of you. Don't regret not fully turning into a monster.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Because that's a very noble thing.   
   
**Asterios:**   
...Right. But...after all...a monster...need proper punishment.   
   
**Jason:**   
W-What the? Hektor, go after them!   
   
**Hektor:**   
I am very sorry, but that's impossible. They sunk into the ocean, with my spear and all.   
   
**Hektor:**   
Asterios likely won't let go of Heracles until he dies&ndash;  
   
**Hektor:**   
By the time Heracles returns,they'll be long gone.   
   
**Jason:**   
...Dammit. Medea!   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Y-Yes?   
   
**Jason:**   
Can you track them?   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Yes, I analyzed their Magical Circuits on contact. I can find them as long as they're somewhere in this world.   
   
**Jason:**   
Can you find the location of the "Ark? "  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Yes. Even without searching for it&ndash;They will find it for us.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
That captain, Francis Drake, was a hero who greatly expanded this world at some point. She is a Pioneer of the Stars.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Since she pioneers this world,she is sure to work miracles.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
If we nip that in the bud, this world will truly be whatever you desire, Lord Jason.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Don't worry, Master. We can capture Euryale at any time.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
As long as those two Servants exist,we will be invincible&ndash;  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
We obtained a fragment of the Holy Grail. With it, we gained the right to rule over this naval world.   
   
**Jason:**   
I see! I get it, we just have to use them! That's my Medea!   
   
**Jason:**   
You indeed are not a treacherous witch, but the wise wife of a hero. That's what you should be called, my beloved Medea.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Treacherous witch...Who are you talking about?   
   
**Hektor:**   
Hey, Princess. When are you planning to tell him the truth?   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Must I tell the truth? The world is going to end eventually.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
For just these seas to last forever...That's something HE would never allow.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
If so, it's not a bad thing to let him bask in blissful thoughts until the end, is it?   
   
**Hektor:**   
...If you say so,then this old man will keep quiet.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Anyway, please warn Heracles. It seems he does have a brain after all.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
He probably knows that Euryale is the key. That's why he tried to kill her, to fend off destruction.   
   
**Hektor:**   
It's hard to believe he has "a brain" in that state...Fine, I'll give him ample warning.   
   
**Hektor:**   
Oh, brother. This old man wishes he was summoned to a proper Holy Grail War...  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
The Hand of the End has ticked forward again. One more push, and "the order" will crumble and fall.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
My beloved. Before then, would you please awaken me from my dream?   
   
## Section 11: Lost Ark of the Covenant   
   
**Pirate:**   
No sign of any approaching ships.   
   
**Drake:**   
...I see.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...  
   
**Mash:**   
...Master. What do you think we should do from now on?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
About that "Ark" they mentioned?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Steal the item they want.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Drake:**   
So what exactly is this "Ark? "  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, please explain.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...The "Ark" contains the Ten Commandments that Moses, leader of ancient Israel, received from God.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
From a historical standpoint,it's a relic equivalent to that of the true Holy Grail.   
   
**Drake:**   
...Hmm. So it has no worth as treasure, then? What a pity.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's what Jason and the Argonauts are searching for. I'm certain that that's what he said.   
   
**Mash:**   
Even with Mistah Blackbeard gone, the Singularity still stands.   
   
**Mash:**   
Which means we should assume that Jason,captain of the Argonauts, is the Singularity.   
   
**Mash:**   
...So should we steal the Ark first?   
   
**Orion:**   
The Ark, huh...How are they planning to use it?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I don't know. I have no idea whatsoever.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Come on. You're not fighting on the front lines,at least make yourself useful.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Oh, sorry, that's not what I meant.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What I found incomprehensible was the actual concept of using the Ark.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The concept itself was incomprehensible?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There's no way to use the Ark?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They say the Ten Commandments are sealed inside. Whoever opens it will be punished...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Basically it's one of those "don't open it" fables. Just like Pandora's Box in Greece.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Which is why I can't even begin to imagine why they'd want to find it and use it. It's just stupid.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I see. Doctor, you're afraid of imagining the worst-case scenario.   
   
**Artemis:**   
You're too cautious. Either that, or you're too smart.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Mm...I admit that I'm too cautious...But you're all so carefree because you don't know about the legend of the Ark.   
   
**Drake:**   
Okay, okay, no more fighting. In any case, it's better to find this Ark thing for sure, right?   
   
**Drake:**   
Let's hurry up and get it. If it comes to it, we can smash it out of spite.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Captain, have you been listening? "The Ark" activates when it's broken or opened.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
And the effect is...well, it is divine punishment. At worst, the surrounding area will be reduced to nothingness.   
   
**Drake:**   
What the hell? Why did ancient kings possess something so dangerous!? Were they all idiots or what?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Don't look at me, I got nothing to do with it.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm for going after the"the Ark. "  
   
**Mash:**   
Um...I'm just not sure how to fight the Argonauts. More specifically, how do we fight Heracles?   
   
**Euryale:**   
Heracles...Even as a Berserker,his powers as a great hero weren't diminished.   
   
**Euryale:**   
It was only because Asterios held him down that we were able to flee to safety.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...Seems like he died.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, most likely.   
   
**Euryale:**   
&ndash;How foolish. We just called his name. That's all it took for him&ndash;  
   
**Euryale:**   
With just that, he felt he could die for us. Just because we called him "Asterios," not "Minotaur. "  
   
**Euryale:**   
That's the reason he risked his life to protect us...It was just that pure and simple.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He had no regrets.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Without him we all would have died.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
...Perhaps. But it might have been better if we were cleanly wiped out then and there.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Asterios died, and Heracles still lives. With just that, it makes it all seem so hopeless.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Sigh. Geez, this had to be the one time where my "loser sister" wasn't summoned.   
   
**Drake:**   
That Heracles...He has to die like ten more times?   
   
**Mash:**   
It's eleven times. But perhaps he died once when he got pierced by the spear at the end.   
   
**Mash:**   
In that case, it's still ten...Not much difference.   
   
**Pirate:**   
Boss, sorry to bug you when you're thinking. But a ghost ship has appeared!   
   
**Drake:**   
Huh? Oh fine, let's take our frustrations out and crush them!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Drake:**   
All right. We'll get going soon!   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? But we have no strategy yet...  
   
**Drake:**   
Oh please, we can just play it by ear! They say you can't deal with trouble till you run into it.   
   
**Drake:**   
Besides, if we waste more time here, they are just gonna come after Euryale again after they grab that "Ark. "  
   
**Drake:**   
Anyway, lay forward!   
   
**Drake:**   
If what Jason said was correct,neither of us has any leads.   
   
**Drake:**   
Though, we have a better chance because I'm here instead of their incompetent captain!   
   
**Euryale:**   
...Well, it's true that Jason's worthless. At least, you're probably a better captain.   
   
**Orion:**   
He's not a bad guy.   
   
**Orion:**   
He's just utterly worthless with a horrible personality,and now he's getting cocky because he's gained some power.   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, I don't understand which part of him is "not a bad guy. "  
   
**Artemis:**   
Just because you say someone's not a bad guy,that doesn't excuse everything they've done.   
   
**Orion:**   
Right. Okay, I take it back. He's not a good guy.   
   
**Orion:**   
He's a scumbag with a terrible personality, but has power.   
   
**Mash:**   
There's nothing good about him whatsoever...  
   
**Drake:**   
See, that's what I meant. In that case, I win.   
   
**Drake:**   
Treasure always ends up in the pocket of the decisive one. That's how this world works!   
   
**Drake:**   
If Heracles is unstoppable, then bring it on. Only humans can challenge the impossible.   
   
**Drake:**   
We're greedy and shameless. We live by dreaming of achieving the impossible!   
   
**Drake:**   
Isn't that right, Fujimaru?   
   
**Drake:**   
Since you've come all the way to this era,that makes you just as big a fool as me, right?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Not as much as you, Captain.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
If that's what you think of me, it's promising.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Drake:**   
Damn right you are! I'm a merchant. I only go after the best goods!   
   
**Mash:**   
...That's right. Both in France and in Rome,that's how it was for us.   
   
**Mash:**   
Let's go, Senpai. With you as my Master,I feel I can take on any opponent!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Anchors aweigh!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Set sail!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Drake:**   
Full speed ahead then! Get to it, men! Sound the bell!   
   
**Drake:**   
The "Ark" will be ours! Let's go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Pirate:**   
Land ho, Boss!   
   
**Drake:**   
All right, get us closer! ...So, what's your take, scholar man?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...This island's no good, either.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
No magical energy detected. We have several weak responses, but based on recorded data it's probably just monsters.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It's a bust. On to the next.   
   
**Drake:**   
You heard her! To starboard! Avoid that island!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Aye, aye!   
   
**Drake:**   
...This island's also no good. That's three in a row.   
   
**Drake:**   
I'm happy the charts are filling up,but nothing looks like a clue.   
   
**Mash:**   
No Servants around, either.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Even if there were, we probably wouldn't find someone who could put up a fight against Heracles...  
   
**Drake:**   
All right, to the next island!   
   
**Orion:**   
...You know, something still bugs me...About that Medea, I mean.   
   
**Mash:**   
Medea...You mean the young girl standing next to Jason, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
She looked too sweet to be called the Witch of Colchis...  
   
**Orion:**   
Yeah. If Medea transformed into a Servant,she'd definitely be her grown up self, right?   
   
**Orion:**   
Medea was betrayed terribly by Jason,so she massacred his wife and children for revenge.   
   
**Orion:**   
...No matter how you look at it, they should've started killing each other the moment she was summoned!   
   
**Artemis:**   
That's awful!   
   
**Artemis:**   
At least Orion only flirts and randomly messes around with goddesses and other people's wives, right?   
   
**Orion:**   
Yeah, it's better to break those off clean...Pugyuru!?   
   
**Orion:**   
Dammit, that was a loaded question!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm. It could be that she's the young Medea.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Servants are summoned at the height of their powers,but this is before she became a witch...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In other words, when she was first learning Magecraft at Colchis Temple...Before she became "Jason's wife. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That explains the way she looked and acted. She hasn't experienced Jason abandoning her yet.   
   
**Mash:**   
I wonder if we should pity her...  
   
**Euryale:**   
Impossible. Once you become a Heroic Spirit,a slight difference in age won't alter your memories.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...I'm sure she knows the outcome of her story with Jason. So why does she act like that...  
   
**Drake:**   
It's obvious she's "acting oblivious. "It's a pity, but also horrifying.   
   
**Drake:**   
Unlike you, she's not someone who can look a person in the eye and pick a fight.   
   
**Euryale:**   
What does that mean? I ignore humans because they don't matter to me, okay?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...I know this! What they call that cold attitude of hers...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That explains Blackbeard's obsession...She's obviously a tsun&mdash;  
   
**Pirate:**   
Boss! A new island!   
   
**Drake:**   
All right! We're sure to hit the jackpot this time!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Orion:**   
Hey, Fujimaru. Which side you betting on?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Jackpot.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Miss again.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Orion:**   
I see. Well, I'm for&ndash;  
   
**Orion:**   
...Eek!?   
   
**Artemis:**   
An arrow in your head, Darling? Jackpot!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, we're under attack!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Oh, an arrow, you should duck.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Darling, hey, hey, does it hurt? Does it actually hurt?   
   
**Orion:**   
It hurts a ton, idiot! G-Gotta pull it out!   
   
**Orion:**   
D-Damn...Hey, I just realized...I can't touch the top of my head!?   
   
**Mash:**   
A shocking fact has just been discovered, Master!   
   
**Orion:**   
Pull it out! Come on, hurry up!   
   
**Artemis:**   
A-All right. Artemis will do her best! Ready, set, twirl...twirl!   
   
**Orion:**   
Ouch ouch ouch! Just hurry up and pull it out! You're ridiculous!   
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh, this makes me so happy! It's not every day people think I'm useful like this!   
   
**Drake:**   
Ugh...You're making me cry...What an admirable maiden's soul. (Tears)  
   
**Orion:**   
Wish you'd make expressions like that under different circumstances!   
   
**Orion:**   
Oh...oh. I thought I was a goner...  
   
**Orion:**   
...Huh? There's something on it.   
   
**Mash:**   
What?   
   
**Orion:**   
Oh, it's a message. Let me see...  
   
**Orion:**   
...Somebody open it, please.   
   
**Artemis:**   
All right. Let's see...Oh!   
   
**Mash:**   
Artemis?   
   
**Artemis:**   
Hehehe, it's from someone I know. So stiff, as usual!   
   
**Artemis:**   
Perhaps because she's a pure girl who's never known love?   
   
**Mash:**   
Someone you know...Um, who would that be?   
   
**Artemis:**   
Uh...This girl is&ndash;  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**D：???:**  
All right, it's delivered.   
   
**E：???:**  
...Whew. They're sure to notice the letter on that arrow. It's not like they have any clues right now.   
   
**E：???:**  
Now they've got to come to this island...They should. But there is an off chance...Or not?   
   
**E：???:**  
Oh no, I'm getting anxious. If they don't figure out that arrow, we'll never get another chance!   
   
**E：???:**  
It's about time the Argonauts found us as well.... And if things don't play out, it's checkmate.   
   
**E：???:**  
...This is bad. It's super bad. I'm getting horribly anxious. I need some medicine.   
   
**D：???:**  
Shut up.   
   
**D：???:**  
They have no will to fight? Impossible. We've already confirmed&ndash;They're determined to fight.   
   
**D：???:**  
We're sure they're seeking the "Ark," right? Otherwise, they wouldn't be going island-hopping.   
   
**D：???:**  
They'll surely come. The world will be destroyed if they don't.   
   
**E：???:**  
Of course my calculations are correct. Oh, but...No, I just can't.   
   
**E：???:**  
I can't stand the anxiety, the feeling that everything is futile!   
   
**E：???:**  
I know, my love...May I hold your hand?   
   
**E：???:**  
I'd like your soft hand to guide me to tranquility. Desperately.   
   
**D：???:**  
May you? You may not. So no.   
   
**E：???:**  
...I'd like an explanation as to why I may not, but...  
   
**Both:**   
They're here!   
   
**Orion:**   
Hey, hey, are you really going to meet HER?   
   
**Artemis:**   
Huh? Of course. She's a hunter who worships me.   
   
**Artemis:**   
I have to give her my blessing.   
   
**Orion:**   
Hmm, well, okay.   
   
**Mash:**   
Orion, is there a problem?   
   
**Orion:**   
I mean, well, Mash. Artemis is the goddess of virginity.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh, Darling. Virginity? You're embarrassing me.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh, but I do run simulations every day of the day I lose my virginity, you see?   
   
**Orion:**   
What's that now?   
   
**Artemis:**   
Um, um. Orion first slams his hand against the wall. Like, SLAM.   
   
**Artemis:**   
And then he whispers in my ear, "Am I not good enough? " In a husky voice! And then, and then&ndash;  
   
**Fou:**   
Foou...  
   
**Orion:**   
I don't know why, but Fou's gaze makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside! I could just cry!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Her head is just way too romantic...If "she" saw that, I think she'd faint from shock.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...Huh?   
   
**Orion:**   
Um, Artemis?   
   
**Artemis:**   
And then, and then? ...Wait, what's with that look?   
   
**Orion:**   
Enemies are here and I'd like you to defeat them...  
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh, dear me! I'm so clumsy! Tee-hee☆  
   
**Artemis:**   
Okay, we'll defeat them quickly!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Combat complete. Let's keep going, Master.   
   
**E：???:**  
Wait!   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Drake:**   
Are you the one who sent that arrow?   
   
**E：???:**  
That's right!   
   
**E：???:**  
...Are you foes of the Argonauts? Or have you already given up and submitted?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Foes.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We haven't given up.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**E：???:**  
...Very well! Then I shall show myself!   
   
**E：???:**  
...Forgive my questioning. I already knew the answer, but I still had to ask.   
   
**E：???:**  
We are, after all, the last hope in these seas.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Atalante, I presume?   
   
**Atalante:**   
Indeed. My True Name is Atalante. A hunter in service to the goddess Artemis.   
   
**Atalante:**   
...Oh, come to think of it, we ran into each other a bit in France, didn't we?   
   
**Atalante:**   
I was affected by Madness Enhancement back then...But this time I've been summoned as a normal Archer.   
   
**Atalante:**   
For now, I perceive to be on your side.   
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you very much. My name is Mash Kyrielight.   
   
**Mash:**   
This is my Master, Fujimaru.   
   
**Mash:**   
And the ship's captain, Francis Drake,and this is Euryale.   
   
**Atalante:**   
Yes, good to meet you.   
   
**Mash:**   
This harmless-looking plush toy is Orion,and the animal is Fou.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou.   
   
**Orion:**   
A pleasure...By the way, Mash, why did you introduce me with Fou? Are we in the same category?   
   
**Mash:**   
Also, this is Artemis.   
   
**Atalante:**   
Francis Drake, Euryale,Orion the plush toy, and Artemis, huh?   
   
**Atalante:**   
...Artemis?   
   
**Artemis:**   
Yeees♪  
   
**Atalante:**   
......  
   
**Atalante:**   
Mash, was it? You can stop joking.   
   
**Atalante:**   
Lady Artemis is the goddess of hunting and virginity. There's no way she could be summoned as a Servant.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Hey, Darling? Atalante doesn't believe me.   
   
**Artemis:**   
What's wrong with the goddess of virginity living for love? Right?   
   
**Orion:**   
Hah-hah-hah. No comment! No comment!   
   
**Atalante:**   
...Huh? Really?   
   
**Artemis:**   
It's true, Atalante. The hunter goddess who lives for love, that's me&ndash;  
   
**Artemis:**   
Artemis! Hehe!   
   
**Atalante:**   
...(Staggers)  
   
**Mash:**   
A-Are you okay!?   
   
**Atalante:**   
I-I'm fine. The Holy Grail War on the great seas has strengthened my mind a bit...  
   
**Atalante:**   
E-Even finding out the goddess I worship is hopelessly romantic won't be enough to break me!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The wound's deep, be disappointed.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hang in there, maiden.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
You don't sound like you mean it! ...Anyway, I would like to introduce you to another Servant.   
   
**Atalante:**   
The Servant in possession of the "Ark. "In other words, the man the Argonauts seek.   
   
**Mash:**   
The "Ark" is a Noble Phantasm!?   
   
**Atalante:**   
Indeed. He was the first Servant summoned to these seas. His True Name is&ndash;  
   
**F：???:**  
Hey, I've been waiting a long time for you guys.   
   
**Atalante:**   
David.   
   
**Fou:**   
Foou...  
   
## Section 12: Defeat Heracles   
   
**David:**   
Normally I'd hold a feast with food and drink,but first, let me explain about the "Ark. "  
   
**Euryale:**   
Fine with me. I like men who get to the point.   
   
**David:**   
Thank you. I am David, King of Israel. The "Ark" is my Noble Phantasm.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...King of Israel?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Israel? You mean...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**David:**   
Yes, that King of Ancient Israel. Is there something on my face?   
   
**Mash:**   
No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Psst! Senpai! I thought it was a perfectly valid question to ask. Let's hear him out for now.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.   
   
**David:**   
...Now, before I continue, it seems we've been interrupted. While we're at it, let's recover any edible meat we find.   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**David:**   
Anyway, back to our discussion.   
   
**David:**   
The "Ark" is a third-rate Noble Phantasm. If you make someone touch the box, they die&ndash;That's it.   
   
**David:**   
Could it be used for evil? ...Yeah, probably. Strictly speaking, it doesn't belong to me.   
   
**David:**   
It's like a contract that God gave to humanity. It's not easy to steal, but it's bad news if stolen.   
   
**David:**   
What's more, you can't shift it into spirit form.   
   
**David:**   
I'm the Servant summoned to this world along with the actual physical "Ark. "  
   
**David:**   
Even if I die,it will remain as long as someone possesses it.   
   
**Mash:**   
It is said that inside the box lies the stone tablets engraved with the Ten Commandments...  
   
**David:**   
But that's not all. That thing brings literal "death," not just metaphorical.   
   
**David:**   
Anyway...After I heard from Atalante that Jason was after the "Ark"...  
   
**David:**   
I hid in the forest with her, and waited for an opportunity.   
   
**David:**   
We waited for properly summoned Servants,like you.   
   
**Atalante:**   
I was summoned as part of the Argonaut crew,but I didn't lose control of myself like Heracles.   
   
**Atalante:**   
Maybe because I never liked Jason in life, or because I was summoned as an Archer who can act freely.   
   
**Atalante:**   
Either way, once summoned,Jason immediately sought the "Ark. "  
   
**Atalante:**   
He kept saying that if he had it,he could be the king of these seas.   
   
**Mash:**   
Is the "Ark" a representation of kingship?   
   
**David:**   
Hardly. It's just a relic I offered to God when I was a king.   
   
**David:**   
It's not a sign of kingship. It's simply something owned by a king.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...David, may I ask something?   
   
**David:**   
Of course. Ask me anything.   
   
**Euryale:**   
If I were to be sacrificed to this "Ark,"what would happen?   
   
**Euryale:**   
If nothing else,that seems to be their goal...  
   
**David:**   
Euryale, right? You were originally a Divine Spirit. If you were sacrificed to the "Ark"&ndash;  
   
**David:**   
Yeah, this whole era would "die. "  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Sigh. I thought so.   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?   
   
**David:**   
Details&mdash;After the fight!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**David:**   
Like I said before, the "Ark"brings death to all things&ndash;  
   
**David:**   
Sacrificing a soul that exists as a god, regardless of rank, would cause the box to lose control.   
   
**David:**   
The death of a god means the death of the world. The Ark is a disaster from that kind of era.   
   
**David:**   
If this was a normal world, it would only destroy the surrounding area, but, hmm...  
   
**David:**   
This is an unstable place that normally wouldn't exist,right? I doubt such a groundless world like this can survive.   
   
**David:**   
Um, a Singularity, was it? The thing blurring the foundation of human history.   
   
**David:**   
This whole era will disappear without having to wait for its collapse.   
   
**Drake:**   
There'd be no need to use a weird Holy Grail...or even steal mine, for that matter.   
   
**Drake:**   
They can use that box to sacrifice a goddess,and at that point it will all be over.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Why does Jason want to destroy the world so badly?   
   
**Atalante:**   
Who knows? ...He may not even know himself.   
   
**Atalante:**   
Somebody may have convinced him that all he has to do is offer Euryale to the "Ark. "  
   
**Mash:**   
&ndash;Either way.   
   
**Mash:**   
We know why they're after this Noble Phantasm,and why we absolutely must stop them.   
   
**Mash:**   
The question is how do we defeat them...By the way, David, is your class Archer?   
   
**David:**   
That's right. Atalante is an Archer as well.   
   
**Mash:**   
Talk about unbalanced. Four Archers, a Shielder,and one Pirate...  
   
**Atalante:**   
We're up against Heracles, Medea, and Hektor. We don't have to count Jason, I suppose.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is he that weak?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
He's weak. Rather, he's never actually fought.   
   
**Atalante:**   
He's a monster who formed the Argonauts with just charisma and eloquence, but he's no fighter.   
   
**Atalante:**   
But I doubt having one useless member in their party poses any problems for them.   
   
**Atalante:**   
...They have Heracles, after all.   
   
**Mash:**   
Multiple resurrections from the Twelve Labors. And above all else, his prominent combat techniques.   
   
**Mash:**   
I don't see how we can beat him.   
   
**Orion:**   
We, on the other hand, are full of fighters who specialize in long-distance combat.   
   
**David:**   
If we can get him to touch the "Ark,"we might be able to instantly obliterate him.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Would he touch it that easily?   
   
**David:**   
It's a what-if. Even a Berserker can sense the magical energy around Noble Phantasms. You'd never walk up to a bomb, right?   
   
**David:**   
If he had no choice but to touch it, then maybe...But how could we force that situation?   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Not just Heracles. Medea and Hektor also possess terrifying power.   
   
**Mash:**   
If all three attack at once,it'll be impossible for us to hold out.   
   
**Mash:**   
If we could at least lure Heracles away from the others&ndash;  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...How about we flee with the "Ark" in tow,and wait for an opportunity...  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor, just go choke on an expired sesame bun or something.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Orion:**   
How about we hole up? Anywhere like that near here?   
   
**Atalante:**   
Nope. Some cramped pagan catacombs are all this island has.   
   
**Atalante:**   
Even if there were some kind of stronghold here,it wouldn't be enough to hold off Heracles.   
   
**Orion:**   
Hmm, I suppose you're right.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou? Fou, fou, fou!   
   
**Mash:**   
What's wrong, Fou? Huh, Master?   
   
**Mash:**   
Master?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I have an idea.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes?   
   
**Drake:**   
Oh good, nice, great idea! You're just as reliable a [♂ man /♀ woman] as I thought!   
   
**David:**   
That's a reasonable strategy. But, besides the Servants,Fujimaru would also be at risk.   
   
**David:**   
Well, I guess that's life. The odds of winning usually go up with your life on the line.   
   
**Euryale:**   
It's quite a gamble. If you fail, you're done. No turning back. A one-shot deal.   
   
**Artemis:**   
So I guess the question is how the enemy will act.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Will Heracles head straight for Euryale?   
   
**Orion:**   
...Out of countless Heroic Spirits, Heracles is likely in the top tier.   
   
**Orion:**   
Even though he's Berserker, I doubt he's completely devoid of intelligence.   
   
**Orion:**   
When he was fighting Asterios,he was dead set on going after Euryale.   
   
**Orion:**   
...That's the reason Asterios somehow managed to keep up.   
   
**Drake:**   
Berserkers are easy to lure. The one I can't get a read on is Jason.   
   
**Drake:**   
He impaled the enemy along with his own ally. Who knows what other cowardly tricks he'll pull off?   
   
**Atalante:**   
No, don't worry about Jason. Trust me. I'm sure he will act this way.   
   
**Atalante:**   
...It's true he's a coward, but, more than that,he places absolute trust in Heracles.   
   
**Atalante:**   
I like Fujimaru's plan. Count me in.   
   
**David:**   
Count me in, too. Since everyone's betting equally,it's fine as long as one of us survives and wins it all.   
   
**Orion:**   
...What destructive thoughts this guy has. Or is it irresponsibility?   
   
**Artemis:**   
And you, Darling?   
   
**Orion:**   
Are you expecting something from me, a plush toy?   
   
**Orion:**   
It's Mash who has it toughest here. She's risking her life on the front line.   
   
**Orion:**   
Shouldn't Mash decide whether we go through with this plan or not?   
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm fine. I'll make sure that the plan Master devised succeeds.   
   
**Mash:**   
Of course, that's contingent on the Doctor's cooperation.   
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor? You've been silent for a while now. Are you listening?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Of course I'm listening. It's risky, but we don't have any time left. Count me in.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
We don't know when or if King David will fall into enemy hands. I'll provide all the backup I can.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's do this.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's win.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Master!   
   
## Section 13: Betting It All   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
That's the island.   
   
**Jason:**   
Ah, I see. Euryale hasn't been killed yet?   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
She's still alive.   
   
**Hektor:**   
...Even though they know they're being targeted...I question their judgment.   
   
**Hektor:**   
...Well, whatever. It's their choice. I'll leave the decisions here up to our captain.   
   
**Jason:**   
All right! The luck of the gods is on our side. Heracles, Medea, Hektor!   
   
**Jason:**   
Land on that island and seize both Euryale and the "Ark! "  
   
**Jason:**   
I&ndash;  
   
**Hektor:**   
Whoa!   
   
**Jason:**   
Huh, arrows? ...What fools. As if these flimsy arrows would work against Heracles&ndash;  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
!!!   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Lord Jason! They're&ndash;aiming at you!   
   
**Jason:**   
...What?   
   
**Atalante:**   
Well then, time to show off all our Noble Phantasms.   
   
**Atalante:**   
I dedicate this to Apollo and Artemis&ndash;"Phoebus Catastrophe! "  
   
**Artemis:**   
Awww...How touching♪  
   
**Artemis:**   
...What's wrong, Darling? Your head is in your hands and you're shivering.   
   
**Orion:**   
It's a knee-jerk-reaction from hearing Apollo's name...  
   
**Artemis:**   
Hehe. Then, it's my turn! Deploy Noble Phantasm! Hear my song of love! "Tri-Star Amore Mio! "  
   
**Euryale:**   
It might be a waste to use my Noble Phantasm on such a disgusting idiot. Well, whatever, I'll use it without hesitation. Noble Phantasm&ndash;"Eye of the Euryale! "  
   
**David:**   
I'm jealous. Jason, you're so popular! Let me share something with you too. Noble Phantasm&ndash;"Hamesh Avanim! "  
   
**Hektor:**   
Whoa, a concentrated attack of Noble Phantasms Ugh, what a pain!   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
They have also mixed in A-rank attacks! They are leaving no openings!   
   
**Jason:**   
W-Why? Why is it all directed to me&ndash;You damn cowards!   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Please stay calm, Master. I shall protect you!   
   
**Jason:**   
Oh, uh, thanks Medea.... But I just can't count on someone so inexperienced...  
   
**Jason:**   
Hektor! You stay here too! Protect me like a true Servant!   
   
**Jason:**   
Heracles! They're just Archers. Pulverize them with one blow!   
   
**Heracles:**   
  
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
...Sigh.   
   
**Hektor:**   
...Up to this point it's going just like the enemy wants it to.   
   
**Hektor:**   
But, what are they planning to do against Heracles? The ox-head aside, that shield girl isn't going to cut it.   
   
**Hektor:**   
To defeat Heracles, they'd need 12 wielders of A-rank Noble Phantasms, or...  
   
**Hektor:**   
No, that can't be. There's no reason to risk one's life to that extent, is there, oh Future Mage?   
   
**Euryale:**   
He's here, Fujimaru.... I mean, Master.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Do everything you can to protect me!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Got it!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's run.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'll show you the route to take! For now, Fujimaru, just run!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Yes, let's go!   
   
**Heracles:**   
  
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)   
   
**Mash:**   
Just as expected, he's targeting Euryale! First, let's hold him down here!   
   
**Drake:**   
All right, I'll give you as much support as I can! Mash, this plan all depends on you!   
   
**Drake:**   
Time to brace yourself!   
   
**Atalante:**   
I'll take Mash with me.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes! ...Mash Kyrielight, here I go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
(Pant, pant, pant...)  
   
**Heracles:**   
  
![1-light](https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png)   
   
**Mash:**   
...As predicted, he's headed towards Euryale!   
   
**Euryale:**   
I know! On to the next!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Euryale:**   
Hey, can't you run any faster?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I am trying!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Doing my best!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
He's here!   
   
**Atalante:**   
He's caught up! Mash, go!   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes! Great Hero Heracles&ndash;!   
   
**Mash:**   
It's time for a rematch!   
   
**Orion:**   
All right, Artemis! Let's do this!   
   
**Artemis:**   
Yeah! I won't pull any punches here!   
   
**Heracles:**   
  
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**David:**   
He's here. Euryale, Fujimaru, hurry!   
   
**Euryale:**   
Master, do your best! Just hang in there a bit longer!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm super-duper running!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm giving it all I got!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Atalante:**   
He's here, so get ready!   
   
**Mash:**   
We've caught up. Here we go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Euryale:**   
Run, run! If we don't hurry...  
   
**Heracles:**   
  
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)   
   
**Euryale:**   
He's here. There's nowhere to run anymore. Scared?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm scared.   
   
**Euryale:**   
I see...Me too.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm not scared.   
   
**Euryale:**   
I see...You're overdoing it.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
If we stop, he'll catch up to us. We have no choice, jump over the you-know-what!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Even if a touch means death!?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm not confident!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
Never mind that and just jump! Trust me!   
   
**Euryale:**   
All right&ndash; One, two, three!   
   
**Euryale:**   
W-We did it! You can do anything you put your mind to, Master!   
   
**Heracles:**   
!!!   
   
**Euryale:**   
He stopped! It looks like Heracles was able to understand...  
   
**Euryale:**   
What that box separating us really is...  
   
**Atalante:**   
That's far enough, Heracles!   
   
**Mash:**   
Heracles, the Noble Phantasm that Jason seeks is right in front of you!   
   
**Heracles:**   
!!!   
   
**Mash:**   
The "Ark" kills whoever touches it. Since you still have ten lives, this is the only way to defeat you.   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, bear with us just a little longer.   
   
**Mash:**   
Heracles, we will stop you! &ndash;Here we go!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
Take this!   
   
**Drake:**   
Force him in!   
   
**Heracles:**   
  
![2-light](https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png)   
   
**David:**   
All right, he touched it!   
   
**Mash:**   
...We've defeated Heracles. No, it was more like he disappeared instead of dying.   
   
**Mash:**   
Honestly, I still can't believe it. Master, are you all right!?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm fine.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I thought I was gonna die.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Euryale:**   
...We were all terrified. But, I'm glad you're not just some savage hero.   
   
**Euryale:**   
You knew your own weakness, and still did what you could. You did a wonderful job, Master.   
   
**Drake:**   
Now, the only one left is that revolting Jason. Let's go free the seas once and for all!   
   
## Section 14: Pioneer of the Stars   
   
**Hektor:**   
...He's late.   
   
**Jason:**   
The arrows have stopped. Medea, check things out with your familiar.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
That's unnecessary. It seems Heracles has been defeated.   
   
**Jason:**   
What? Hey Medea, that's not funny.   
   
**Drake:**   
Oh, there he is. Hey Jason! Can you hear me?   
   
**Drake:**   
Well then, we're coming for you!   
   
**Jason:**   
...Impossible! Heracles! What happened to Heracles!?   
   
**Drake:**   
Oh, come on. You really need to ask?   
   
**Drake:**   
If he was alive,we obviously wouldn't be, right?   
   
**Drake:**   
Since we're alive, it means he's dead. That's pretty simple logic.   
   
**Jason:**   
There's no way he'd die! He's Heracles! The great immortal hero!   
   
**Jason:**   
He's the epitome of a hero, someone who heroes admired, challenged, yet still fell short of!   
   
**Jason:**   
There's no way a petty, ragtag bunch like you could ever overcome someone like that!   
   
**Drake:**   
...I guess even you felt a semblance of friendship. Even if it was a distorted one.   
   
**Drake:**   
Well, fine. If that's what you want to believe, so be it. We'll settle the match.   
   
**Jason:**   
Ugh! ...Get us out of here!   
   
**Hektor:**   
Oh, thinking of running?   
   
**Jason:**   
We're retreating! Using this Holy Grail,all I need to do is summon a new Servant!   
   
**Hektor:**   
As far as I can tell, we're still at an advantage here.... Well, gotta follow the captain's orders.   
   
**Drake:**   
So you ARE thinking of running. Just as I thought. Men, are you all ready?   
   
**Drake:**   
"Golden Hind! "This is our last voyage, our final task as pirates!   
   
**Drake:**   
The target is the Argo! The treasure they hold captive is the freedom of the seas!   
   
**Drake:**   
We'll have them pay us back in full! Ring the bells, brothers!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Aye, aye, Boss!   
   
**Drake:**   
Hard to port! Make a steady approach and fire the cannons and guns!   
   
**Jason:**   
What're you doing? Hurry up and cut us loose!   
   
**Hektor:**   
With so many Archers on their side, their attacks are that much more fierce.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Never mind the cannonballs...It's Atalante's arrows. We're the only ones who can block them.   
   
**Jason:**   
Damn, how are they catching up! This is the legendary ship, Argo!   
   
**Jason:**   
It's in a different class from their mundane sailboat!   
   
**Hektor:**   
The difference is in the helmsman, I guess. Those are the skills of one who has lived with the sea.   
   
**Hektor:**   
They're fundamentally different from someone who just takes his boat out casually.   
   
**Jason:**   
Damn...We have no choice. O Holy Grail!   
   
**Drake:**   
We've caught up with you, pretty boy! Let's see what you got!   
   
**Jason:**   
You lowly scum! Go! Kill them!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**Mash:**   
...That's a Shadow Servant! Be careful, everyone!   
   
**David:**   
Oh boy. What a rotten thing.   
   
**David:**   
...But, I guess since you're relying on tricks like this,it means you're pretty much cornered, right?   
   
**Jason:**   
How dare you, you piece of...  
   
**David:**   
Now, now, Jason was it? No need for such a scary face...Guess I really hit the mark, didn't I?   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Drake:**   
All right, let's board! ...Then again, we're just all Archers.   
   
**Atalante:**   
I'm going. Being an Archer doesn't mean I can't handle close-range combat.   
   
**David:**   
In that case, I guess I'll go, too. If I die, I'll trust you'll take care of the rest.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**Mash:**   
Mash Kyrielight, here I go!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Jason:**   
Hektor!   
   
**Hektor:**   
Yes, yes, I know. All right, Medea.   
   
**Hektor:**   
If the need arises, I'll be counting on you.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Yes. It is my duty to protect our Master. I will look after him until the very end.   
   
**Hektor:**   
Oooh, scary...Is this what they mean by "naturally insane"...Hm?   
   
**Hektor:**   
Hi, future [♂ boy /♀ girl]. Your name was Fujimaru, right?   
   
**Hektor:**   
I'm impressed you've come this far. It's truly amazing. France, Rome, and now "here. "  
   
**Hektor:**   
I appreciate you coming all this way. I value that kind of perseverance.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
This guy!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you know about Chaldea?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Hektor:**   
Oh, my hunch was right, that's all. I'm just a warrior who couldn't pick a Master to serve.   
   
**Hektor:**   
Now, let's see who can hold out longer. This old man is pretty confident in defensive battles.   
   
**Hektor:**   
So&mdash;Come at me with everything you've got, brat. I'll show you how experience trumps youth.   
   
**Mash:**   
...This is Hektor, the hero of the Trojan War. We can't let our guard down. Let's take him down, Master!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Hektor:**   
...Dammit, this is it for me. Well, I did what I could.   
   
**Hektor:**   
But at least I'll leave a parting gift. Euryale, offer your life&ndash;to the "Ark! "  
   
**Mash:**   
Oh no!   
   
**Euryale:**   
&ndash;Yes, that is what I expected you would do.   
   
**Hektor:**   
Wha...  
   
**Euryale:**   
"Eye of the Euryale. "  
   
**Hektor:**   
Urgh...This old man's scheme...How did you see through it?   
   
**Euryale:**   
Oh, I didn't see through anything. But you killed Asterios.   
   
**Euryale:**   
That alone was reason enough for me to pay close attention to you, old man.   
   
**Hektor:**   
...Pfft. I guess I'm just not cut out to be a villain.   
   
**Hektor:**   
I thought I'd at least go out big at the end of the world. But your hands are tied when the "top" is terrible.   
   
**Jason:**   
Wha...Hektor!?   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Hektor has passed on, too. Lord Jason, what shall we do now?   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Impossible to surrender or retreat. I'm a mage who can only heal and defend.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Now, what shall we do?   
   
**Jason:**   
Silence, woman! If you're my wife,act like one and think about protecting your husband!   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Yes. Of course I am thinking, Master. After all, that's what a Servant does.   
   
**Jason:**   
...What's that look? Why are you still smiling!? Don't you understand what this situation means?   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**David:**   
Wait! Before that, I have a question for Jason.   
   
**David:**   
...Who gave you such an idiotic idea as sacrificing Euryale to the "Ark? "  
   
**Jason:**   
That's none of your business!   
   
**David:**   
Oh, I think it is. After all, if you had sacrificed her, the world would have been destroyed.   
   
**Jason:**   
&mdash;What?   
   
**David:**   
Of course. That box brings death.   
   
**David:**   
To offer it a Divine Spirit is completely insane.   
   
**David:**   
This era is unstable to begin with. It would have killed the era itself.   
   
**Jason:**   
&mdash;Ridiculous. Lies. That can't be&mdash;  
   
**David:**   
That's why I'm asking you.   
   
**David:**   
"Sacrificing a Divine Spirit will grant infinite power. "Who tempted you with that promise?   
   
**David:**   
Was it Hektor? Medea?   
   
**Jason:**   
...Medea? He's lying...isn't he?   
   
**Jason:**   
Sacrificing a Divine Spirit to the "Ark"would've grant me powers and invincibility, right?   
   
**Jason:**   
I mean, that's what HE told me...  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
It is no lie. After all, the death of an era brings complete destruction.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
If the world is destroyed, your enemies will cease to exist. See&ndash;? That makes you invincible, no?   
   
**Jason:**   
Y-you. You people lied to me?   
   
**Jason:**   
That doesn't serve my purpose at all! I was finally going to create an ideal nation!   
   
**Jason:**   
One where everyone respects me! A true utopia, where all are content, and there is no war!   
   
**Jason:**   
Was this trial not for that purpose!? Was it not to give me a second chance!?   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
...That is a dream that can never come true, Lord Jason. It is beyond you.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
You'll never be an ideal king. Even if your heart truly wished for peace, your soul is hopelessly twisted.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
You cannot make your dream come true. Not in the manner that you desire.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
You will only realize your fate the moment you obtain what you truly desire, then crush it with your own hands.   
   
**Jason:**   
What...What are you talking about, witch!? What does a woman who was holed up in a rural shrine know!?   
   
**Jason:**   
I was born the son of a king, but my uncle robbed me of my throne. I was forced into the care of a centaur!   
   
**Jason:**   
Even while suffering that indignity, I became resourceful. I built the Argo and gathered a crew of heroes!   
   
**Jason:**   
So what part of me!? Where!? Where am I lacking the qualifications to be king!?   
   
**Jason:**   
I just wanted to take back my own land! I just wanted my own nation!   
   
**Jason:**   
How is that wrong, you traitor!?   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
...Such a pity. Ever since I was summoned,I have told you nothing but the truth.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I am Princess Medea. Prior to being betrayed,I was a witch who blindly believed the one who summoned me.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
That is why I have protected you all this time. You were chosen by "that" king.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Everything is real, everything is true.... Though there may have been some misunderstandings.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
For example, I just said I would protect you, yes? But how I will protect you&ndash;  
   
**Jason:**   
Huh?   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
This, is how.   
   
**Jason:**   
Wha-!? Y-You! Stop! What are you doing!? Aaah! No! My body is melting!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fouuu! Fouuuu!   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
O Holy Grail. O ultimate vessel granting my desires. Manifest. Remember. You are one of the 72 Demon Gods.   
   
**Jason:**   
Arggh, ack, aieeeeeeee!   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
&ndash;I shall give you the strength to fight. I shall give you the strength to rise up.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Let us fight together for the sake of destruction.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Now then, rank number 30. Sea Fiend Forneus. Use that power to put an end to your journey!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
A Demon God! This is the second one of those things, I mean deities, we've seen! Something like that really exists?   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**David:**   
This is a surprise...What did she just say?   
   
**David:**   
Rank number 30, "Forneus!? "She's talking about Solomon's Demon Gods!   
   
**Atalante:**   
Will we&ndash;Be able to defeat it?   
   
**Drake:**   
I hit it! All right, if it can be hit, it can be defeated!   
   
**Drake:**   
Mash, this is truly the final battle! Come, get a hold of yourself!   
   
**Drake:**   
You came all this way to slay that thing, didn't you? So hold your head up high!   
   
**Drake:**   
This is it! The final battle! Be brave and laugh your fears away!   
   
**Drake:**   
Say, "I have no use for a monster! Just give me a pretty crown! "  
   
**Pirate:**   
Whoaaaa!? We...We just heard somethin' awfully rare, yeah!?   
   
**Pirate:**   
Did Boss just say a seriously feminine line!?   
   
**Drake:**   
Shut up you fools, go hide in your cabins! This isn't something you can handle!   
   
**Drake:**   
A-Anyway, Mash, just do it! And forget what I just said!   
   
**Drake:**   
If you keep hesitating, I am going to take that second Holy Grail for myself!   
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Captain Drake.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, understood! Master, visual confirmation of the final enemy of this era!   
   
**Mash:**   
Commencing correction&ndash;!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's go, Mash!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We're gonna win, Mash!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
...We got it, Master!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All right!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you okay?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes!   
   
**Jason:**   
Oh...ah...ugh...Medea, Medea, Medea...  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
&ndash;Yes, Jason. Is something wrong?   
   
**Jason:**   
...Fix me, my Medea. It hurts, it hurts, it really hurts!   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
...  
   
**Jason:**   
What are you doing you slowpoke? I said, fix me.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
&ndash;I can't do that, Jason. I'm sorry.   
   
**Jason:**   
...Huh?   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I will be falling soon myself. It's such a pity. Originally, the world would've sunk with you.   
   
**Jason:**   
...Why you, just as I thought...  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Although it has nothing to do with me,but it's true that I did know you.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Even as we speak,the memories of Princess Medea are coming back to me.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Even if she was betrayed, even if she was cursed at,even if she'd been deceived from the very start.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
She truly, truly adored her Lord Jason. You had been given divine power, yet&ndash;  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
You were endlessly innocent. Like a child excited over receiving a paltry treasure.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
You were hopelessly cruel, and completely innocent. Despite being weak, you attracted others and inspired loyalty.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
That's who you were, Jason. That was her first love.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
But you were quick to betray everything. That's the only way you knew how to live.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
If so&mdash;isn't it easier to sink along with the world,so that you won't be betrayed?   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
You were never&mdash;supposed to return to your land.   
   
**Jason:**   
Damn...witch! ...You treacherous...damned witch!   
   
**Jason:**   
Die! Die! Go to hell! Dammit, dammit, DAMMIT&ndash;!   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
...I'm sorry, Lord Jason.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I wanted to protect you from him,but I had no way of doing so.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
I don't have much time left...I only wish I could have dreamed a beautiful dream in my final moments...  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Medea's about to vanish...No, before she does! Fujimaru, you have to ask her!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who's behind all this?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Were you allies with Lev, too?   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
...I'm no longer at liberty to tell you that,since I have lost to him as a mage.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Princess Medea the mage,not the Servant, was defeated?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
In other words&mdash;  
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Yes. Please be sure to prepare yourselves,newest and last mages from a distant era.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
You don't stand a chance against him. As mages, you have no prayer of defeating him.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
So&mdash;go gather stars. Numerous dazzling stars.   
   
**Medea Lily:**   
Stars that can rise against the greed and beast hidden within man's heart. Stars that can remain bright even within a storm and light up the sky&mdash;  
   
**Mash:**   
Elimination confirmed. Holy Grail collection complete.   
   
**Mash:**   
No enemies left. End combat actions.   
   
**Mash:**   
Era correction&ndash;complete.   
   
**Drake:**   
The wind has stopped blowing...Ah, this is the end. There is nothing that can be done.   
   
**Drake:**   
This sea will end soon. But not anything like the giant whirlpool earlier.   
   
**Drake:**   
This is a good ending. It's a new birth&mdash;Our sea is coming back to us!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Heee&mdash;eey! It's goodbye to this damn weird sea&ndash;!   
   
**Pirate:**   
We did it, men! Can's say I won't miss it, though! After all, these waters were full of adventure!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Hey, we're vanishin', one after another! Guess that's how life works, the rank and file exit first!   
   
**Pirate:**   
Mash and Fujimaru, see ya! Thanks for helpin' the captain!   
   
**Pirate:**   
We'll get hanged sooner or later, but you're good folk! Let this be a lesson! Never keep the company of pirates!   
   
**Mash:**   
Everyone...  
   
**Artemis:**   
Haaaa! We can finally go home!   
   
**Artemis:**   
Come on, Orion! A new journey of love awaits!   
   
**Orion:**   
This is supposed to be a nice goodbye scene. Don't you want to look cool?   
   
**Orion:**   
Oh, forget it. I'm tired.   
   
**Orion:**   
Well, I hope we can meet again with me in a different form! Farewell!   
   
**Orion:**   
Oh, and Mash. How about a kiss goodbye for good measure?   
   
**Orion:**   
No? Oh, okay.   
   
**Artemis:**   
Darling, how about a "goodbye" from me?   
   
**Orion:**   
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!   
   
**Euryale:**   
And so our roles are played out now. Oh, what a terrible time.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Without "me" or my "loser sister" around,it's dreadfully boring.   
   
**Euryale:**   
...Although I would like to meet HIM again someday.   
   
**Euryale:**   
I'll have to call him by name, and make fun of that embarrassing confession of love.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Oh, that's right. Fujimaru, you did well, too. As a final reward, I'll give you a little kiss.   
   
**Euryale:**   
Get down on your knees. Here&ndash;(smooch. )  
   
**Mash:**   
Wha!?   
   
**Euryale:**   
Well, safe travels. Make your next struggle as merry as this one.   
   
**Mash:**   
...  
   
**Atalante:**   
...Whew. I'm happy I was of service this time. I didn't want to be defeated like last time.   
   
**Atalante:**   
That said, I haven't really shown what I can do yet. So please call on me again sometime.   
   
**Atalante:**   
Still...From now on, how should I go about honoring Lady Artemis?   
   
**David:**   
Well, it's about that time.   
   
**David:**   
It seems you have various struggles ahead,but do your best without being discouraged.   
   
**David:**   
With two humans, a quarrel ensues. 100 will create competition, 1000 will cause confrontation.   
   
**David:**   
That holds true no matter what era. You should fight your own battle.   
   
**Mash:**   
Please, wait. You knew about the 72 Demon Gods.   
   
**Mash:**   
Was that...Um, really a Demon God? The doctor claims they don't exist...  
   
**David:**   
Oh? Did I say as much? Why would you think so?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Well, naturally. You're King David of Israel.   
   
**Mash:**   
You are the father of King Solomon,who is said to have summoned the 72 Demon Gods.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**David:**   
Hmm. It's true Solomon is my son...But summoning spells are beyond my capabilities.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...How utterly useless...  
   
**David:**   
Ah, how rude. But what about yourself?   
   
**David:**   
It seems you said that Demon God was no Demon God. On what grounds?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
W-Well, that's&mdash;That wasn't exactly my image of one, or...  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Ahahaha. Roman is a fan of King Solomon. I hear he's been an admirer for a long time?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hey, Leonardo! That was a secret! A secret!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's why you don't accept the Demon Gods, isn't it? You don't want to believe your idol messed with such disgusting things.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Ugh...Right, you're correct! The 72 Demon Gods signify both the beginning and the pinnacle of summoning spells!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
They couldn't be foul creatures like that! I mean, he's King Solomon, you know!?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
He's the king who held the omnipotent Ten Rings, built the First Temple in Jerusalem, and made Israel prosperous!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
How could someone like that command such monsters, or even worse, plot...plot the destruction of humanity!?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
There you go. As his father, what do you think, King David? Does King Solomon have a connection to that Demon God?   
   
**David:**   
Mm, Solomon would do things like that, you know? Basically, he's a cruel, vulgar good-for-nothing.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
What? How terrible! I can't believe anything anymore!   
   
**David:**   
Hahaha. My apologies. It's my fault for not having much to do with Solomon. I was never interested in child-rearing.   
   
**David:**   
But certainly&mdash;though he was a fool, he was honest.   
   
**David:**   
As for destroying human history, well...  
   
**David:**   
I don't think he'd consider it unless he was betrayed by all ten of his secret lovers?   
   
**Mash:**   
In its own way, that makes his image even worse.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Just how bad is the public's image of King Solomon!?   
   
**David:**   
Well, I must be going. I leave the rest to you,but if anything happens, don't hesitate to call on me.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...Right. So we still don't have any definite information about the Demon Gods yet.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
But&mdash;King Solomon is involved,and that's the ugly truth...  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Oh no, never mind. Now, Captain Francis Drake.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Thank you very much. With so many special cases this time, I wasn't really much help.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Lucky we had a dependable voyager like you on site. Thanks to that, history has been successfully corrected.   
   
**Drake:**   
Oh, it was nothing. I couldn't do much in the end.   
   
**Drake:**   
Ahhh...If I could become one of those Servants too,I'd be a little flashier.   
   
**Drake:**   
But I suppose that's an impossible request. A pirate like me could never be treated like a hero.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's not true.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're already a fine hero, Captain.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Drake:**   
Really? Since that's coming from you, I'll believe half of it.   
   
**Drake:**   
So if history is corrected, will I really lose my memories of all of you?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's what happens.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Drake:**   
Hahaha. Well, you don't have to say a word. That look on your face says everything.   
   
**Drake:**   
I see. Guess I can't sail around the world with you folks. A pity.   
   
**Drake:**   
But that's fine. Our time together was short, but it was a merry journey.   
   
**Drake:**   
So go. For seafarers, parting is always abrupt.   
   
**Drake:**   
Blown up by a cannonball, washed away by a wave,and ultimately lose sight of our destination and die.   
   
**Drake:**   
That's why we take those fears&ndash;and always "brush them off" with a laugh.   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, goodbye,Captain who navigates across the seas of freedom.   
   
**Mash:**   
...It's too bad. During this journey, I wanted to discover my wish and report it to you, Captain.   
   
**Drake:**   
Mm? What we talked about before? How you're troublesome because you have no wishes?   
   
**Drake:**   
It bothered you that much? Don't be silly. Or rather&mdash;  
   
**Drake:**   
You already have a wish, Mash. You know very well what you want to do.   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?   
   
**Mash:**   
Captain Drake, what do you mean...  
   
**Drake:**   
Saying you have no wish is wrong. In the first place, nobody is without greed.   
   
**Drake:**   
All humans have some kind of wish. You can't live without one.   
   
**Drake:**   
The only difference is living while knowing what it is,or spending your whole life not realizing it.   
   
**Drake:**   
...Same with that Jason guy. Even he had a dream of "creating a utopia. "  
   
**Drake:**   
His homeland banished him, and didn't save him. I don't know if he did all this to prove them wrong.   
   
**Drake:**   
Still,he wanted his nation to be a peaceful one.   
   
**Drake:**   
The man was obsessed with the desire to rule,and at the very end, he arrived at his true wish.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Jason's actions and behaviors were reprehensible.   
   
**Mash:**   
But&mdash;surprisingly, he was thinking of the people. Though selfish, he was trying to protect others.   
   
**Drake:**   
Aye. Sometimes sinners do saintly deeds, while saints sin. That's humans for you. That's us.   
   
**Drake:**   
That's why everyone's got a wish.   
   
**Drake:**   
It's just that some go their whole lives without realizing what their true wishes are.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Captain Drake. Which type am I?   
   
**Drake:**   
You...You're the type that's better off not realizing. You should stay just the way you are.   
   
**Drake:**   
I'm sure you'll know in the end.   
   
**Drake:**   
You'll realize what you want to do, and why you continue to raise that shield to defend others.   
   
**Drake:**   
I'm the opposite, I already know. The sooner you know,the uglier the punchline ends up being...  
   
**Mash:**   
...Captain Drake. Are you, um...From now on, your life...  
   
**Drake:**   
It's fine. You needn't state the obvious. I know how it ends for me. I die, right?   
   
**Drake:**   
Life is interesting once you know you're going to die. No, because you will die, you want to live in the moment.   
   
**Drake:**   
I'm not really a fiend for treasure. What I want is money, and pleasure.   
   
**Drake:**   
We're gonna die eventually! So I want to enjoy every single moment while I can.   
   
**Drake:**   
Thanks to you, I now know how vast the world is. It's a never-ending journey, even if I go all out.   
   
**Drake:**   
I'd be satisfied to take just a little of that,and blaze one of the many trails available.   
   
**Drake:**   
How blessed, how inconvenient, and how it would be just like what I wished an ending to be.   
   
**Drake:**   
So never mind. Don't worry yourself over my dying days.   
   
**Drake:**   
Farewell, Mash and Fujimaru. You too, cowardly scholar guy!   
   
**Drake:**   
The reward for saving an era...Let's see&mdash;  
   
**Drake:**   
When your journey ends, just remember how much fun you had with me! That'll be enough!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Will do. Farewell, Captain!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Bon voyage!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Welcome home. Good job, Fujimaru and Mash.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
This makes three eliminated Singularities. Protecting human history...That mission is no longer just a pipe dream.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'll look into that Demon God on my end. For the time being, I'll focus on King Solomon's era.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'll use Chaldeas and Sheba to observe the Earth of 1000 BC.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Are you sure?   
   
**Mash:**   
Sheba's range is the Christian Era. Go back further than that and you lose accuracy.   
   
**Mash:**   
Plus, it would require vast amounts of magical energy and electricity. Chaldea's current reserves aren't that&mdash;  
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
With my pride on the line, I'll take care of that somehow. As for magical energy, I might know someone who can help.   
   
**Mash:**   
Really? I thought chances for outside help were nonexistent?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? Oh yeah, sorry. I had the wrong idea. I'll get by somehow with Da Vinci's stash.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Anyway, you two need to unwind. Next up is the fourth Singularity&mdash;the turnaround point.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
France, Rome, and the sea. Each time, the number of irregularities has been increasing.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Maybe with the next Singularity,the real target will come.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
That's why I want you to rest up. We've got some time until the next Rayshift.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fooou!   
   
**Mash:**   
Good job, Senpai. You did your best too, Fou.   
   
**Fou:**   
Ky, kyuuuu!   
   
**Mash:**   
...By the way, Senpai. Did you want to sail around the world with Drake?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A little.   
   
**Mash:**   
Me too.   
   
**Mash:**   
The captain was larger than life,but overflowed with charm.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go after this is over.   
   
**Mash:**   
After our battle is over?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. Not a trip via Rayshift, but a journey in this era.   
   
**Mash:**   
I want to enjoy a world in which the future isn't decided yet, just like Captain Drake.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai. I think this recent search for the Holy Grail was the most special case so far.   
   
**Mash:**   
The process solely was to head somewhere. It was a battle on a seemingly endless sea.   
   
**Mash:**   
Along the way, I think I learned something.   
   
**Mash:**   
Good and bad people alike contribute to human history. Human diversity and contradictions. Expectations, too.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Humans are brutal creatures. They use wisdom and gain power for their own desires and objectives.   
   
**Mash:**   
That is a truly brutal trait. You could say that they are the most powerful and barbaric organisms on the planet.   
   
**Mash:**   
But there's hope in that brutality...The hope of realizing what couldn't be realized.   
   
**Mash:**   
The power not to let the impossible remain impossible. This power, this hope, she taught us that is what makes us human.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I don't know if I have such a power. But, I'd like to get as close as I can.   
   
**Mash:**   
So I can keep fighting by your side, Senpai. To become a Servant that you can be proud of someday.   
   
**Mash:**   
Now, then, Senpai, Fou, sweet dreams. We're on dry land for the first time in a long while.   
   
**Mash:**   
We don't have to worry about getting seasick anymore. Please have nice and long rest.
