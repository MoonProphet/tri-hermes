# Trial Quest - Arthur Pendragon  
  
## 一一一一Someday, The Day of Salvation for this Planet Will Come  
   
**Narration:**   
...   
   
**Narration:**   
Well, crap...   
   
**Narration:**   
This all started right after I got separated from the Servants during our investigation of a Singularity.   
   
**Narration:**   
I thought that as long as I could stay in touch with Chaldea, I'd be able to meet back up with everyone...   
   
**Narration:**   
The Chaldea staff could've told me my coordinates, or even where the Servants all are...   
   
**Narration:**   
But every single thing seemed to go wrong. I tried contacting Chaldea, but got no response.   
   
**Narration:**   
I should've heard Mash calling for me. Instead, all I can hear now is...   
   
**Narration:**   
...   
   
**Narration:**   
...If I had to describe it in colors, I guess it's red and black. It howls like a beast hungry for blood.   
   
**Narration:**   
I'm in a tight spot here. What Mystic Code did I put on before we left?   
   
**Narration:**   
If I could at least cast Gandr, I'd shoot one off. Then, regardless of how that goes, I'll just book it as fast as I can!   
   
**Narration:**   
...But, will that really work?   
   
**Narration:**   
Sweat trickles down my cheek. My mouth trembles. Think. Think. But that beast doesn't look like it'll give me time to think...   
   
**Narration:**   
I'm taking a chance. Whether it'll work out or not...   
   
**B：???:**  
...Are you all right? You should stand back.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Turn around)  
   
**Knight:**   
Hah!!!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Step back)  
   
**B：???:**  
Good. Right there's fine.   
   
**Knight:**   
Hmph!   
   
  
---  
  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Exhale)  
   
**Knight:**   
...You've got some guts.   
   
**Knight:**   
You watched that attack and didn't so much as flinch.   
   
**Knight:**   
Do you have some knowledge of swordplay? Or, I suppose you have been through more than your share of trials...   
   
**Knight:**   
Whoops, sorry. Looks like we don't have much time to chitchat.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Thanks. You saved me.  
   
**Knight:**   
You're welcome. Are you hurt, brave stranger?   
   
**Knight:**   
You're certainly no ordinary person. If you were, you'd have fainted when you stared that beast down.   
   
**Knight:**   
I'd love to talk to you more in detail... but I don't have the time.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Knight:**   
A herd of beasts and their king are coming this way. I doubt we can reach a peaceful resolution.   
   
**Knight:**   
If you don't mind, would you fight with me? You seem to be the type who's strong enough to do that.   
   
**Knight:**   
Are you by chance a mage? Well, at least you don't seem to be completely lost in a battle of magecraft.   
   
**Knight:**   
That magical energy enveloping you must be Command Spells. Are you a Master?   
   
**Knight:**   
Well then, you must have some experience dealing with Mystics, which are so far beyond simple magecraft.   
   
**Knight:**   
...They're here. Sorry, I'm just short on time. So, would you give me your answer?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's fight together.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'd appreciate it if you'd let me!  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Knight:**   
Thank you. Now then, let's take this horde of beasts down together!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Knight:**   
Good. We managed to escape for now.   
   
**Knight:**   
I knew it! You're a skilled mage. I'm no expert on magecraft, but I can at least say this:   
   
**Knight:**   
You have the power to fight. I don't just mean the skills necessary to fight...   
   
**Knight:**   
You possess a sword. A sword that dwells within your heart, that is.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Knight:**   
Hey. Did something happen?   
   
**Knight:**   
You look a little unfocused. Did you use too much of your magical energy?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You look familiar.  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Knight:**   
I believe this is the first time we've met. Based on what you're wearing, you must be from the 20th century.   
   
**Knight:**   
Or perhaps from the beginning of the 21st century. You may have had an opportunity to meet me...   
   
**Knight:**   
No, I don't remember.   
   
**Knight:**   
Hey. You didn't come here alone, did you?   
   
**Knight:**   
You must have gotten separated from your group. Am I right?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yes.  
   
**Knight:**   
I see. Okay, got it.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Exactly!  
   
**Knight:**   
Haha. That's the spirit!   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Knight:**   
Okay. I will stay with you until you find your companions.   
   
**Knight:**   
Don't worry. We'll find them soon enough.   
  
**--SECTION BREAK--**  
   
**Mordred:**   
UN-FREAKIN'-BELIEVABLE!   
   
**Mordred:**   
And where the hell have YOU been!? Why'd you wander off like that!?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Don't think for one second you're gettin' off easy just 'cause you came back in one piece. Next time, don't you dare wander off without telling me!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sorry!  
   
**Mordred:**   
...Ugh.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I suddenly lost contact with Chaldea...  
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh yeah, Mash did mention something like that.   
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
Um...the connection is maybe not so great.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I mean, yeah, it's pretty damn cool we can communicate in real time with Chaldea, no matter where or when we are...   
   
**Mordred:**   
...but it's kinda useless once we start runnin' into weird magical anomalies and crap like Bounded Fields, huh?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Hunting for Singularity remnants... I figured we could forget about them and they'd disappear on their own.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Or...has it gotten so bad that it was on its way to becoming a full-blown Singularity?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, you are right. It was on the brink of becoming a miniature Singularity...   
   
**Mash:**   
The swordsman that Senpai encountered was likely caught up in whatever was going on.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Oh, the guy who saved Master.   
   
**Mordred:**   
We didn't see his face... He left right before we met up with Master.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Aw, c'mon. I can't believe he's managed to survive wandering around this place alone. Who was he?   
   
**Mash:**   
His name was...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Now that you mention it...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I didn't ask.  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
He left without giving his name? Hah. What a big shot. I can't put my finger on it, but something about him sort of pisses me off.   
   
**Mash:**   
U-um... Regardless of whether he's human or a Rogue Servant...   
   
**Mash:**   
He had amazing combat power. He was able to keep up with those giant creatures.   
   
**Mash:**   
According to Senpai...he was a hooded man who looked like a knight?   
   
**Mordred:**   
Huh? A hooded knight? That means he's not from that Singularity, to say the least.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He was like a knight, or maybe a swordsman...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's like a knight in shining armor.  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
What the heck?   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai mentioned that the man's attire reminded [♂him /♀her] of the Knights of the Round Table. Isn't that right, Senpai?   
   
**Mordred:**   
What? Us? But I don't remember anyone with a hood.   
   
**Mordred:**   
I mean, Gareth wore a helmet all the time. And that jackass Percival didn't have anything either...   
   
**Mordred:**   
Or...uh, did he wear a helmet? Like, when he was super serious? ...No, wait... Er, maybe that was Palamedes?   
   
**Mordred:**   
...Nope, nope, it was definitely a helmet.   
   
**Mordred:**   
So no. None of us wore hoods.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Well...maybe when we were out on an expedition and it rained, I guess... Still, though...   
   
**Mash:**   
I see...   
   
**Mordred:**   
Master, what type of weapon did he use?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A sword inlaid with gold and silver.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I couldn't see what it was at first...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mordred:**   
...No. It can't be.   
   
**Mash:**   
???   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Do you have a minute, Master? I was rechecking the calculations on the Rayshift coordinates...   
   
**Jekyll:**   
And I found some points that concern me. Actually, the one who made the discovery was Mr. Babbage.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Anyway, I'm looking for Miss Da Vinci. Would you happen to know where she&ndash;   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, Jekyll. Da Vinci should be in Lab 2.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Hey! We're talking about something important, you nerd! We didn't call you, and Da Vinci's not here either!   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt... Hey! Ow, ow, ow!!!   
   
**Mordred:**   
Stop overreacting. I just gave you a little poke.   
   
**Mordred:**   
Ugh. This is why you're such a loser.   
   
**Jekyll:**   
Well, that was actually... Ungh... No, never mind. Nothing. Haha.   
   
**Arash:**   
Hey, Fujimaru. Good, good. Looks like you came back in one piece.   
   
**Arash:**   
You Rayshifted out somewhere to get rid of a small Singularity, right? I heard all about it.   
   
**Arash:**   
Sorry I couldn't help. So... Yeah. Make sure to take me with you next time, okay?   
   
**Arash:**   
You'll never get lost again with me around. I've got good eyes.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I did get lost a bit...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But it was an accident!  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Haha. I see. Well, I'm not blaming you or anything.   
   
**Arash:**   
But, well, why don't you tell me about it? Hearing you tell me about your own travels might be nice for a change.   
   
**Arash:**   
I actually want to hear, directly from you, who you met.   
   
**Arash:**   
...   
   
**Arash:**   
...I knew it. You met HIM.   
   
**Arash:**   
I get it. I guess this is what you would call fate.   
   
**Arash:**   
I didn't think he was in the Throne of Heroes. No... He isn't... So? What's your take on it?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Eh? Huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Arash, what are you talking about?  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Sorry for being so cryptic. My bad, Master. I'm really not sure what to say...   
   
**Arash:**   
Umm...   
   
**Arash:**   
...   
   
**Arash:**   
Well, I guess it's not entirely impossible. Yeah, yeah. Looks like I'll be able to enjoy my drink tonight!   
   
**Arash:**   
Hahahaha. So he's still out there, somewhere, fighting!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Explain!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What the heck!?  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Arash:**   
Haha! Come on, don't say that! Ha... But yeah...so it was him...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Arash!!!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Stare at him silently)  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Arash:**   
...O-okay.   
   
**Arash:**   
Well, yeah. I know! If there's ever a chance, you'll see him again! Yeah!   
   
**Arash:**   
Hey, hey. Wait! Quit hitting me! It doesn't hurt, but for some reason I feel bad, like I did something wrong.   
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
What's going on, Arash? What, are you having your very own drinking party right in the middle of the hallway?   
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
Oh hey. Master's here too. What's up?   
   
**Arash:**   
Ah, the Child of Light!   
   
**Arash:**   
Oh, it's nothing. Haha, this may actually have to do with you!   
   
**Arash:**   
You should keep this a secret from the pharaoh, the valkyrie lady, and the alchemist.   
   
**Cú Chulainn:**   
...Huh?   
  
**--SECTION BREAK--**  
   
**Knight:**   
...   
   
**Knight:**   
I thought there was something sinister this time around...but I don't sense the noxious gas of L or the lingering scent of R.   
   
**Knight:**   
Things aren't going as planned. I guess I have no choice but to search more thoroughly.   
   
**Knight:**   
...   
   
**Knight:**   
Yeah. It'll be all right, Merlin. I will accomplish my goal, and then return to where I belong.   
   
**Knight:**   
Soon. One of these days.   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Narration:**   
A voice hailed me, asking me to wait.   
   
**Narration:**   
Why? I turned around, surrounded by a field of golden grass.   
   
**Narration:**   
I thought I had arrived at the place where I belonged. After all, by now my time as king was no more than a distant memory.   
   
**Narration:**   
The time I spent fighting for Britain... Ten years of bravery and honor, charging from battlefield to battlefield with the Knights of the Round Table.   
   
**Narration:**   
And that's not all: even the time I spent living as a solitary knight after that...   
   
**Narration:**   
...and yes, even that two-week-long Holy Grail War in the Far East at the end of the 20th century&ndash;one fought over a false Grail...   
   
**Narration:**   
...all for the sake of a girl who taught me things I never would have learned in my life as a king.   
   
**Narration:**   
All of it, no more than a distant memory now. That begs the question...   
   
**Knight:**   
Why stop me now?   
   
**Knight:**   
I just arrived here. I did what I needed to do, and ended everything.   
   
**Knight:**   
I finally reached the place...the promised place. Just as the legend to be passed down through the ages said.   
   
**Knight:**   
I thought I was going to form a contract with the world...   
   
**Knight:**   
But that is not how it went. I got my answer, and then my life ended.   
   
**Female Mage:**   
...Hehe.   
   
**Female Mage:**   
You have the appearance of a young man, yet you speak like an old man.   
   
**Female Mage:**   
No, I wonder. My king. Britain's eternal king and wielder of the sacred sword...   
   
**Female Mage:**   
There must be many things you have left undone. I'm sure you know already, right?   
   
**Female Mage:**   
You have yet to truly and finally defeat that which you are destined to destroy.   
   
**Female Mage:**   
Once in 1991 A.D. Once more in 1999 A.D.   
   
**Female Mage:**   
Twice you struck it down, but that devourer of cities is persistent. It's not over yet.   
   
**Knight:**   
That's...   
   
**Female Mage:**   
Hehehe. Yes, exactly!   
   
**Female Mage:**   
Great child of Uther... My beloved red dragon! That's right, this situation is terribly irregular!   
   
**Female Mage:**   
Yes, it is a state of emergency so severe, you were roped into this the instant you arrived at Avalon!   
   
**Female Mage:**   
It should have ended the second time. But somehow, it's back for round three! It's unfathomable!   
   
**Female Mage:**   
Hehe. Perhaps an Original Species awakened somewhere?   
   
**Knight:**   
...   
   
**Female Mage:**   
Really, I must say! It's a truly rotten twist of fate! After all, you're not supposed to be here.   
   
**Female Mage:**   
Now's not the time for you to come knocking on my door. It can't be now. You're ten years too early.   
   
**Knight:**   
Wait. Merlin, what are you talking&ndash;   
   
**Female Mage:**   
You still need to continue your journey. Whether it be in your world, or in another universe.   
   
**Female Mage:**   
You may travel through dimensions or even phenomena. Anywho, yeah, hang in there.   
   
**Female Mage:**   
Why? How, you ask? Well... Yeah, I wonder... I can't say for sure.   
   
**Female Mage:**   
This could be a deep-seated curse put on you as the wielder of a sacred sword, or it could be something that was sprung on you right before a long break...   
   
**Female Mage:**   
...It may be the great Grand Order.   
   
**Knight:**   
...Grand...Order...?   
   
**Female Mage:**   
Either way, you need to leave here immediately. And that's also why I stopped you. Listen...   
   
**Female Mage:**   
I'm going to say this again: your journey has not ended.   
   
**Female Mage:**   
It can't end. For her sake as well.   
   
**Female Mage:**   
What did you feel from her? Light? Radiance? Affection? Or all of them?   
   
**Female Mage:**   
They might all end up in a whirlpool of gluttony. If you don't continue your journey, that is.   
   
**Knight:**   
!!   
   
**Knight:**   
Merlin, wait! Explain yourself! I've been wondering about this for a while, but you're too cryptic!   
   
**Female Mage:**   
What the heck? That's mean. Oh well. Come on, hurry up and get going!   
   
**Female Mage:**   
You'll get to meet me face-to-face next time! This time, too bad!   
   
**Female Mage:**   
My king, the last Pendragon! May your new journey be blessed! We shall meet again!   
   
**Female Mage:**   
If you meet another me in a parallel universe, be kind to them!   
  
**--SECTION BREAK--**  
  
**Knight:**   
...   
   
**Knight:**   
I have yet to meet another you, Merlin, but I haven't forgotten what you said. For now.   
   
**Knight:**   
...This is yet another world that has gone to ruin.   
   
**Knight:**   
Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon, was it? No, destruction and pruning have nothing to do with each other.   
   
**Knight:**   
I suppose scenes like this are commonplace for any phenomenon that gets pruned.   
   
**Knight:**   
The decay of a civilization... The destruction of a city... No matter how many times I see it, I still can't get used to it.   
   
**Knight:**   
But then again...it's still too early for me to give up. Right, Merlin?   
   
**Knight:**   
...If only there were some survivors.   
   
**Knight:**   
Hm?   
   
**Knight:**   
!!   
   
**Knight:**   
A person...out of nowhere!? You're...!?   
   
**Knight:**   
You're that stranger I met earlier! So you're someone who can travel through time and space, too?   
   
**Knight:**   
A-are you all right? It looked like you fell from a ways above the ground...   
   
**Knight:**   
No, before you answer that, you need to know that this land's atmosphere is poisonous to living creatures!   
   
**Knight:**   
Do you have a gas mask or a Mystic Code? If you don't, take one of my talismans.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...H-hello.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...My head's spinning.  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Knight:**   
...!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where am I?  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Knight:**   
You've awoken.   
   
**Knight:**   
What a surprise. Well, there's no shortage of those today.   
   
**Knight:**   
First, you appeared out of thin air. Second, you are somehow alive when the air is pure poison.   
   
**Knight:**   
You're definitely full of surprises. But for the time being, as much as I'm glad you woke up...   
   
**Knight:**   
Let me ask you this first: Are you hurt anywhere?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm fine.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't think anything's broken.  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Knight:**   
I see. I'm glad.   
   
**Knight:**   
So...why did you come to a wasteland like this?   
   
**Knight:**   
There's not much here. Actually, there are really only dangerous things here.   
   
**Knight:**   
Do you make a habit of running headlong into danger?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Rayshif&ndash;

**Fujimaru 2:**   
U-uh... I mean, what was it again...?  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Knight:**   
I see.   
   
**Knight:**   
You're either holding something back or your memory is fuzzy. I won't ask questions.   
   
**Knight:**   
But, yeah. If you're falling from the sky from out of nowhere...   
   
**Knight:**   
...then you're not just some lost mage...at least this time around.   
   
**Knight:**   
(Thinking back to what happened last time, could this child have gotten caught up in my warps?)   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did you say something?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I think I heard something...  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Knight:**   
Uh... Well, if I try to explain, it'll just complicate things. Sorry.   
   
**Knight:**   
No, I should at least tell you what I can. Though the ruler of this land is sure to approach me soon...   
   
**Knight:**   
Okay. We have at least some time to talk.   
   
**Knight:**   
Let's begin with introductions. I failed to do so last time because I was in a hurry.   
   
**Knight:**   
My name is Arthur Pendragon.   
   
**Arthur:**   
I was the King of Britain in the past. But now I am a mere knight.   
   
**Arthur:**   
I am not human like you. Do you understand that?   
   
**Arthur:**   
I'm a Heroic Spi&ndash;I am currently a Servant who possesses a Spirit Origin. Unfortunately, I have no Master.   
   
**Arthur:**   
The wielder of the Sacred Sword of the Planet, Excalibur. Yes, my Noble Phantasm.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The sacred sword...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
King Arthur!?  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Arthur:**   
What an unexpected reaction.   
   
**Arthur:**   
...Do you, by chance, know who I am?   
   
**Arthur:**   
I see... Chaldea... The Incineration of Humanity... The 21st century...   
   
**Arthur:**   
A female King Arthur...   
   
**Arthur:**   
And your name is Fujimaru. That has a nice ring to it.   
   
**Arthur:**   
You were supposed to be able to communicate in real time with the Chaldea in 2019...   
   
**Arthur:**   
No, I believe you. Actually, many of my questions have been answered. You must have gone through some truly difficult battles.   
   
**Arthur:**   
...Yes, I can feel it.   
   
**Arthur:**   
Being a Master to one Servant is tough enough, but to be able to form contracts with multiple Servants and keep battling...   
   
**Arthur:**   
Truly, that is an achievement that goes beyond imagining. No ordinary person could save the world, after all.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...You think so?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Thank you, King Arthur.  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Arthur:**   
You're amazing. You seem to have walked an even more treacherous path than I have.   
   
**Arthur:**   
Unless you...   
   
**Arthur:**   
...Ah. Maybe you...   
   
**Arthur:**   
...   
   
**Arthur:**   
He mentioned... So it was you.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who are you talking about?  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Arthur:**   
I don't really know the specific location or era. I was there for a very, very short time relative to the other places I've visited.   
   
**Arthur:**   
I warped before I could confirm his name. I couldn't even say goodbye to him.   
   
**Arthur:**   
But... Yes, I still remember.   
   
**Arthur:**   
I remember being able to see a large, red, iron bridge...   
   
**--SECTION BREAK--**  
  
**???:**  
Well, yes. I don't mind if you think I am crazy.   
   
**???:**  
What I am about to tell you may seem unbelievable... It does not bear any weight especially in a peaceful country like this one.   
   
**???:**  
I wouldn't want it to bear any weight anyway. Because even if it was true, there's nothing anyone can do about it.   
   
**???:**  
And of course it's difficult to accept...   
   
**???:**  
That's why...   
   
**???:**  
I'm going to talk while I imagine the astonished look on your face.   
   
**???:**  
If things continue as they are, the world will end.   
   
**???:**  
The world will be incinerated without ever seeing 2019. This has already been determined. It is a foregone conclusion.   
   
**???:**  
...What do you think? Surprised?   
   
**???:**  
Or do you think I'm insane? Do I look like a pathetic man who's been possessed by some pessimistic delusion?   
   
**Arthur:**   
Of course not. I believe your words.   
   
**Arthur:**   
Your eyes must see through everything. You're not the first person I've met who has the power of Clairvoyance.   
   
**???:**  
Thank you. Though I don't have powers of that sort.   
   
**???:**  
Know this, O wandering king: even your sacred sword cannot prevent the future I saw.   
   
**???:**  
The Incineration of Humanity is simply too perfect of an achievement.   
   
**Arthur:**   
...   
   
**???:**  
But. But, you know...   
   
**???:**  
If by chance the world does not end in 2018... And if you can continue your wandering journey...   
   
**???:**  
You may be able to meet...   
   
**Arthur:**   
Meet you again? Here?   
   
**???:**  
No, not me.   
   
**???:**  
If by chance everything goes well, I will likely have met my end.   
   
**???:**  
But the person you're going to meet is someone I believe will become important to me as well.   
   
**???:**  
Someone who could accomplish something I could never do...   
   
**???:**  
Someone who carries love and hope... Someone who keeps aiming for tomorrow, for the sake of a yesterday that has been lost!   
  
**--SECTION BREAK--**  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't tell me that person is&mdash;  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Arthur:**   
Hm...   
   
**Arthur:**   
...It's getting near.   
   
**Arthur:**   
I thought I could talk longer, but time's up. Looks like the ruler of this land is here.   
   
**Arthur:**   
It's one of the sources of the decay of this time and age.   
   
**Arthur:**   
Perhaps it's a Demonic Beast that somehow became corrupted. Or it could be a type of weapon that was created by someone and abandoned.   
   
**Arthur:**   
Sorry to stop our talk midway. But then again, my story ends here anyway.   
   
**Arthur:**   
Because right after that conversation, I warped somewhere else. I have no control over that.   
   
**Arthur:**   
Nothing has changed. Regardless of what I want...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Your situation sounds a lot like Musashi's...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wait. Was the person you were talking about earlier  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Beast:**   
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!   
   
**Arthur:**   
...Bloodlust, hostility, malice. Nothing else, huh?   
   
**Arthur:**   
An incarnation of massacre. A device of destruction that cannot stop itself. It may not be a Beast, but it is still evil.   
   
**Arthur:**   
You are not the Beast I am searching for. But you are still my enemy.   
   
**Arthur:**   
I'm sorry, Fujimaru.   
   
**Arthur:**   
It's time to battle. I'm sure our opponent will come at us with everything it has, so I cannot hold back.   
   
**Arthur:**   
I'm sorry for dragging you into this. I will protect you with all my strength. But if it's at all possible...   
   
**Arthur:**   
If I could ask... No, would you like to fight alongside me?   
   
**Arthur:**   
The one who fights to save the world. You, the one to whom that man entrusted everything...   
   
**Arthur:**   
I want to engrave the sight of you into my memory once again!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Got it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
And in exchange, you need to finish your story!  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Arthur:**   
Okay, that's a promise!   
   
**Arthur:**   
Let's go. For now, you shall be my Master!   
   
**Arthur:**   
There's no need to be connected through Command Spells. You only need to show me your resolve to save the world!   
   
**Arthur:**   
And to go along with your dazzling actions, I shall show you the light of this planet!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Arthur:**   
...We're done. Good work.   
   
**Arthur:**   
It wasn't the Beast I was looking for, but at the very least, its death should halt this place's deterioration.   
   
**Arthur:**   
I'm not entirely clear on how all this works. But apparently this is what my journey entails.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
King Arthur, you promised.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Please continue your story.  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Arthur:**   
Oh, right. There's something I need to tell you.   
   
**Arthur:**   
The man I met and conversed with...   
   
**Arthur:**   
His name was Rom&ndash;   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai!   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, thank goodness! We finally connected! Scanning your vital signs in three...two...one!   
   
**Mash:**   
Scanning... Okay, all done! Good, looks like nothing is wrong with your body!   
   
**Mash:**   
I will begin preparations to bring you back immediately! Please hold still, Senpai!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Communication is back up!?  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Uh, ahem. Hey. It's me, Da Vinci.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
There was a...tiny snafu in the program that handles the Rayshift coordinate calculations.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It wasn't a mistake that just developed out of nowhere. It was there from the beginning. Let's just say that there was a shortcoming in one of the formulae.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
The result itself doesn't change. But yeah, it's a bug.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's what was causing all the problems. It was Rayshifting you, and only you, to weird coordinates.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Anyway, simply put, it was just a bug. I'm sorry, really! It wasn't that I made any mistakes in the design stage; it was just me being negligent as a manager!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, and it's not Romani's fault either. It's my fault, since it's all under my jurisdiction. I'm really sorry!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Babbage was the one who found it after doing some calculations because he had nothing better to do. I guess you really can't give those analog folks flak.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see... I mean, wait a minute!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm in the middle of talking to King Arthur!  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?   
   
**Mash:**   
Um, do you mean Altria...?   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm only detecting you there. Is...another Servant with you?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Eh?  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Arthur:**   
...Seems like they cannot see me. Perhaps my Spirit Origin does not exist in your world.   
   
**Arthur:**   
If the King Arthur you know is female, that means she's me, but not me.   
   
**Arthur:**   
I don't exist. At least not in your world's history.   
   
**Arthur:**   
You may need to ask Merlin for details, but yeah.   
   
**Arthur:**   
I'm sure that's what it is.   
   
**Arthur:**   
...Oh, or maybe it's because my warp has already started?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You were about to tell me a name...!  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Arthur:**   
You should already know. It's the same name that the beautiful lady mentioned just now.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So it was Romani Archaman...!  
   
  
---  
  
   
**Arthur:**   
Yes, that's right.   
   
**Arthur:**   
I firmly believe that the person he was talking about was you.   
   
**Arthur:**   
How is he doing now? ...No, I shouldn't ask. At least not right now. Not now.   
   
**Arthur:**   
That's why, Fujimaru...   
   
**Arthur:**   
Instead of saying goodbye, let me say this:   
   
**Arthur:**   
I'm glad I met you, brave child, savior of the planet under a distant sky.   
   
**Arthur:**   
You, who inherited the will of the man I encountered during my journey.   
   
**Arthur:**   
May your perilous journey be blessed, Fujimaru! And when we meet again under the same sky, someday, someplace...   
   
**Arthur:**   
Let us fight alongside each other again.   
   
**Arthur:**   
To save your world. To save tomorrow.   
  
**--SECTION BREAK--**  
  
**Da Vinci:**   
Hm? What is it, Doctor?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hehe. I don't have as much free time as before. You see, everyone realized how useful I am.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That's why I'm super busy every day. I mean, think we're taking too much of the burden of Chaldea's future onto ourselves?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But that's just me complaining. Though, I don't mind sparing some time to listen to you talk.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Hm? Would I be okay with just idle chitchat or gossip?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yeah, sure. I'm just going to work while I listen. Now come on, talk to me.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Uh-huh. Oh. I see. Ah.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. Yep.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Eh? What? What did you just say?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Before that. The thing you said before that. Something about a thing near the bridge in Fuyuki City.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...You've met the male King Arthur? Was he a Heroic Spirit? When?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Before Chaldea's Summoning System was established? But that's impossible. How long ago was that?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Either way, that was after Fuyuki's Grail War ended, right? Even with a tremendous amount of spiritual evocation and other powerful ceremonial magecraft...   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Summoning a Heroic Spirit that can converse coherently would be impossible.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Besides...   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hm. Wait. Something's not right.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
If what you're saying is true, it must be because of that! The Singularity in Fuyuki! The Greater Grail!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So that reaction you had when you first saw the female King Arthur on the monitor was...   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Eh?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You forgot? Completely?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Yeah, I don't blame you. If a random man calling himself King Arthur came up to you, no one would give it much credence.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Nobody would think, “Whoa, it's the real King Arthur!” And I'm sure he wouldn't stick out in your memory. But then again...   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You have your position to think about. You're in Chaldea, after all.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...Oh. I see.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You say that, but the expression on your face tells me you're fondly thinking back on that day, Romani.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It's nothing to be embarrassed about. Heh heh. Oh, let me guess.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I bet you said something really embarrassing!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Am I right?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
...   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hahahaha. Nope. Can't do that. You can't say you were kidding after that reaction! There's no fooling me!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Just give up and tell me everything! Come on, I won't judge!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
It'll be all right. So what did you tell him?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Eh? You made a wish? To the King Arthur you saw in Fuyuki?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
What did you wish for...?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
No. Yeah. It'll be much more interesting if you don't tell me right now.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Maybe tell me tomorrow... Or maybe someday far from now...
