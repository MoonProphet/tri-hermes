# Trial Quest - Brynhild  
  
## Our Beloved Hero (Human)  
   
**???:**  
&mdash;Good morning. Are you awake, my dear Sigurd?   
   
**A：???:**  
Ah, you're finally awake. Good morning. Morning has arrived even upon Hindarfjall.   
   
**A：???:**  
The sun is shining, the little birds are chirping at one another... such a wonderful morning...but not really.   
   
**A：???:**  
I am certain that the doom of Chaldea will be here. The world will burn to ashes.   
   
**A：???:**  
Yet still, you stand to face it. For the ceaseless tomorrows, for the ever-coming tomorrows.   
   
**A：???:**  
...Good morning. I shall be accompanying you for a very short while.   
   
**A：???:**  
My name, let me see...Companion... Valkyrie...No...no. Now, though, yes.   
   
**A：???:**  
&mdash;Call me Mash.   
   
**A：???:**  
You see, as I am now, call me Mash. My adorable, shining, and fleeting Master.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? But you are...  
   
**Mash:**   
...Ah, yes. Now I remember. It seems you have some degree of resistance.   
   
**Mash:**   
Then I have no choice but to do this. I'm sorry. To be honest, I want you to be just the way you are.   
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm...sorry.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't know your real name, but I do know...  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, you're right... Even though this is the end of time, you...   
   
**Mash:**   
...You have not shown weakness in your mind. Even now, you can think of others...   
   
**Mash:**   
A beautiful heart. A strong heart. I believe that was once what I loved.   
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...I'm sorry, now...for just a short while, I will touch your lips. With these fingertips.   
   
**Mash:**   
It's all right. There is no need to worry... Yield to the rune.   
   
**Mash:**   
...There. It's finished.   
   
**Mash:**   
How do you like it? You know my name, my hero, my Master.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm pretty sure it was Mash.  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, Master. My adorable Fujimaru.   
   
**Mash:**   
All right&mdash;let's Rayshift together again today. My hero. To save the world.   
   
**Mash:**   
...There is still some left. The Demonic Fog, that is.   
   
**Mash:**   
The way things are... There are still traces from the Fourth Era that are yet to be repaired.   
   
**Mash:**   
Demonic Fog. Life-stealing death mists that are packed with magical energy. Like the atmosphere during the Age of the Gods.   
   
**Mash:**   
If it's the end of the 19th century AD... The atmosphere should be close to that of 20th century Tokyo...   
   
**Mash:**   
However, you might call this a tragedy... As this is the last island left with ancient mystics...   
   
**Mash:**   
...Industrial...revolution... ...The people who brought about the evolution of civilization...   
   
**Mash:**   
...I can't believe these people will be slain in this way. What a cruel, ironic punishment.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Are you all right, Mash?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're looking awfully pale.  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Ah...   
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Ahh&mdash;   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry for causing you this trouble&mdash; Apparently I was affected by the Demonic Fog. I...   
   
**Mash:**   
I can't believe... I allowed myself to be so shamefully overcome...   
   
**Mash:**   
To be caught in one's arms... by a human child...by you...I'm sorry...   
   
**Mash:**   
Ohh... Dear, me...Your...your...   
   
**Mash:**   
...Your...hand. It is so warm...   
   
**Mash:**   
But Sigurd's hands had been so cold... but now, you're...so warm...   
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;Wait! I'm sorry. I'll step back. When we touch each other too much, it rattles me.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm so flustered... Your warmth makes the flame inside me grow strong.   
   
**Mash:**   
Before my flames burn you to ashes, allow me to test you. Allow me to learn what kind of person you are.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Your flames will burn me to ashes?  
   
**Mash:**   
...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
How are you going to test that  
   
**Mash:**   
...You'll see... soon enough.   
   
  
---  
   
**D：???:**  
   
**Mash:**   
You heard that, right? It reached you, right? That is the destiny which you must face.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Someone is fighting within the Demonic Fog!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It sounds like a Helter Skelter!  
   
  
---  
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
Oh! How beautiful! Such a lovely Valkyrie!   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
Rejoice, my brawny Berserker friend, help tantamount to an army has come to assist!   
   
**Beowulf:**   
You idiot! That is a maiden of Heorot. Her beauty is questionable. Getting involved with her is trouble.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Hey! It's not as if I'm going to die here, nor do I have any business in your manor.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
So don't you wander up to us like tha... I see, so you've already been stopped by a mistletoe.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Then I guess you're of no harm to us... Whoa!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Two Heroic Spirits?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
They are fighting the machines?  
   
  
---  
   
**Beowulf:**   
Why yes, I'll crush the enemies I see before me. That's all I am doing here.   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
Hahaha! Whatever the era, wherever the location, there is only one road for the honorable Knights of Fianna!   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
Namely, the path of righteousness! Destroy evil! Protect humans! Honor first shines upon those that shepherd in eternal peace!   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
I hold no grudges. No, never! I am a man of endless generosity!   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
When the isle of Britain is Erin's, there too I shall equally display righteousness.   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
Ahh&mdash;How logical and bright! What's more, this unrivaled, handsome young man is at his peak! What could be better!?   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
When a person is shining, he must shine to his fullest. Wouldn't you agree there, Berserker?   
   
**Beowulf:**   
It seems our interests are similar but completely different in nature. However, it's true that we are both greedy in our desires.   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
Precisely! We speak of what we want, and we mercilessly pummel enemies that get in the way! It's what heroes are made of!   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
I don't get along with you in the least, but it seems to me that we are essentially of the same breed.   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
This seems to be a rare place where our paths have crossed. Hahahahaha! This is an excellent omen!   
   
**Beowulf:**   
You said it. As long as we have the power to crush our enemies, then it's all good.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
&mdash;Hey! You there, Master, and your companion.   
   
**Mash:**   
Companion&mdash; He called me a companion... That person seems like a very good Heroic Spirit.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
What did you come here for? If you're wandering through these mists, then you're certainly not a pitiful citizen of London.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Let me ask you again, what have you come here for?   
   
**Mash:**   
...I take back my previous statement... That was the question I wanted to ask, horrible beast.   
   
**Mash:**   
I have a question for you as well, ageless, fleeting, and shining one. Fujimaru.   
   
**Mash:**   
What is it you are doing, as we continue to Rayshift, today, tomorrow, and forever?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
&mdash;Fight.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Someday save the world.  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...I don't know...what to say.   
   
**Mash:**   
You are too radiant and glorious... When I gaze upon you shining so brightly...   
   
**Mash:**   
I...in this very moment have decided... even though I am here...   
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;No, no! To battle, Fujimaru. You will achieve victory. Because I am at your side.   
   
**Mash:**   
Even if we didn't have the protection of god, even if we didn't have the protection of this world...   
   
**Mash:**   
I, for this time alone, will grant you the protection of a great Valkyrie warrior&mdash;   
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
   
**Beowulf:**   
&mdash;What a ridiculous fight. If I'm gonna get in a punching match it should be with a Servant.   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
You mean several, right? The more powerful the enemies are, the more joy there is in defeating them, and the greater the profit.   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Profit? Who needs that? It's unnecessary. Do you take money from a woman after sex?   
   
**Beowulf:**   
Just forget it. There'll be no more killing here. Farewell, nameless Master.   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
Well, well. He was a formidable warrior to the very end. True, he was strong, but I'm sure he would've run out of enemies to defeat.   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
It goes to show that I need not have worried.   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
In fact, you resemble my own subordinates. You've made me feel a little parental affection, or should I say, kingly affection.   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
&mdash;Yes. Now let me address the lovely lady over here!   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
In this fight with the speechless iron knights and dolls, you displayed magnificent heroism.   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
Therefore, a romance with this battle maiden seem inevitable... If I had the time, I would certainly go through with it, but...   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
It seems this materialization is but a temporary one, I am destined to return to my former battlefield.   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
What a pity. When it comes right down to it, I am too impatient to remain here any longer...   
   
**Fionn mac Cumhaill:**   
Yes, I must end the boredom here! Farewell, young Master! Away!   
   
**Mash:**   
Alas...   
   
**Mash:**   
...I don't know...what to do...   
   
**Mash:**   
Humans leave only destruction in their wake, yet even in these times, you, my hero, resist.   
   
**Mash:**   
You can stand side-by-side with the dragon slayer Beowulf. You can fight alongside the god slayer Fionn mac Cumhaill.   
   
**Mash:**   
When I see you like that, I... I...   
   
**Mash:**   
&mdash;I really don't know what to do.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why don't you know what to do?  
   
**Mash:**   
When you are so heroic... I can't help...but to...love you...   
   
**Mash:**   
I love, I love, I love you. I love, I love, I love, I love you...   
   
**Mash:**   
...I end up...loving you...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm not sure what to say  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I'm...sorry... ...I really will...be more careful.   
   
**Mash:**   
I will be more careful...   
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...But, ohh... No, no. You make me so flustered, that, ohh...   
   
**Mash:**   
All I can do is show you who I am. Fujimaru.   
   
**Mash:**   
My true name is Brynhild. Yes, that is the truth. I am not Mash Kyrielight.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? What the... Really?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
As I thought, you aren't Mash.  
   
  
---  
   
**A：Brynhild:**   
...Yes.   
   
**A：Brynhild:**   
I was the Valkyrie, the machine, who assisted the great god Odin of northern Europe, yet was transformed into a human woman and met my death. That is I.   
   
**A：Brynhild:**   
Please forgive me. Due to who I was in life, I cannot help but see into your soul...   
   
**A：Brynhild:**   
Therefore, I have come to a decision. My father, Odin... I cannot be your daughter...   
   
**A：Brynhild:**   
I will be a woman carved into human history, I will be a hero's companion.   
   
**A：Brynhild:**   
...Alas, these cries are from the Demons. This is the final summoning of the last vestiges of the Demonic Fog.   
   
**A：Brynhild:**   
They may have even been guided to us by the damnable blue flame. Either way...   
   
**A：Brynhild:**   
...How dare they...interrupt...what I want to say!   
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
   
**Brynhild:**   
&mdash;Ahh, I killed it.   
   
**Brynhild:**   
The vile enemy that stood between us is dead. It's all over now.   
   
**Brynhild:**   
How unfortunate... But, yes, this may be for the best.   
   
**Brynhild:**   
If I remain with you any longer, I would surely... be in greater and greater trouble...   
   
**Brynhild:**   
...Therefore, let us part for now.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Will we meet again?  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Yes, yes. Until that day...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We'll meet again.  
   
**Brynhild:**   
...That's right. Someday, when the stars align and our paths cross...   
   
  
---  
   
**Brynhild:**   
Take care, and stay healthy, my fleeting and fragile, but strong and stout, beloved human child.   
   
**Brynhild:**   
I'm sure that when we meet again, I'll be of assistance.   
   
**Brynhild:**   
&mdash;Farewell. You're the world's newest hero, my Sigurd.
