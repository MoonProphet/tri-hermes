# Trial Quest / Strengthening - Mysterious Heroine X  
  
Attention! This takes place during Saber Wars 2!  
  
## "Interlude Entracte I"  
   
**:**  
A little while ago in a Servant Universe far, far away...   
   
**:**  
　　　　　　　　　　～Planet Lothian～   
   
**A：???:**  
...Black Knight.   
   
**A：???:**  
Black Knight...   
   
**A：???:**  
Yeah. You. Servant AUX Voloid K6-X4.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Eh...are you talking to me?)  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(...I can't speak.)  
  
  
---  
   
**A：???:**  
Are you mad?   
   
**A：???:**  
You sometimes space out. Even though you're a Voloid. You're really an odd one.   
   
**A：???:**  
Did you, just, intercept some funny transmission? That's, no good.   
   
**A：???:**  
There may be a time when I'll have to rely on you during battle. Maybe.   
   
**A：???:**  
Yeah, but...I guess I don't really have room to talk about spacing out.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(...Voloid?)  
   
**A：???:**  
...Hm? Dumpling?   
   
**A：???:**  
You want a dumpling? I just ate it. That dumpling.   
   
**A：???:**  
But, you know&mdash;   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(What battle...?)  
   
**A：???:**  
... (Sigh) Red bean soup?   
   
**A：???:**  
I'd like some, too. But&mdash;   
   
  
---  
   
**A：???:**  
What are you talking about? Your train of thought's gone off the rails.   
   
**A：???:**  
Your conversational protocol's also been strange. Maybe I need to check for crossed wires.   
   
**A：???:**  
It's unfortunate, but it looks like we're going to be apart from each other for a while.   
   
**A：???:**  
Is it this...circuit here... Or this one...?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Stop, you're tickling me.)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(This nonsensical way of talking... Berserker?)  
  
---  
   
**A：???:**  
... (Gasp)   
   
**B：???:**  
Alter. X Alter.   
   
**X Alter:**   
Yes, Master Agravain. Alter is here.   
   
**X Alter:**   
Has the next land to purge been prophesied?   
   
**Agravain:**   
...   
   
**Agravain:**   
...We will need to go into hiding for a while. Their pursuit has grown more aggressive each day.   
   
**X Alter:**   
I shall join you. No matter what kind of desolate star it may be.   
   
**Agravain:**   
That is unnecessary. There is another job better suited to your skills.   
   
**Agravain:**   
Alter. Guided by the Alternium, the prophesied child of destruction...   
   
**Agravain:**   
A Berserker formed using the X Factor as a catalyst...   
   
**Agravain:**   
A crystal of Alternium is hidden within your body, and you are granted the Ultimate Anti-Anti-Saber Weapon.   
   
**Agravain:**   
In this region of space, few know of you. That fact will aid us as we prepare to strike back.   
   
**Agravain:**   
Our fellow lords have all fallen and been sealed away. The only one left is me&mdash;   
   
**X Alter:**   
I am still here, Master. I, Alter, your own disciple.   
   
**X Alter:**   
I shall not let the sacrifice of our great lord of Villains be in vain.   
   
**X Alter:**   
My Mana Conversion Altereactor Engine is burning furiously, ready to defeat our sworn enemy, Heroine X.   
   
**Agravain:**   
...Alter. What I am about to tell you is of the utmost importance. Carve it deep into your heart. Also, write it down on a piece of paper so you do not forget.   
   
**Agravain:**   
You are going to go in hiding, and go on a journey alone.   
   
**Agravain:**   
You are the final hope of Dark R.O.U.N.D.S. Or something like that.   
   
**Agravain:**   
We must focus on the opportunity to realize our wish, while we work, obscure, from the shadows.   
   
**Agravain:**   
We must sink into the muck, and become a slumbering dragon. For such a task, I would only be in your way.   
   
**X Alter:**   
That... No...   
   
**X Alter:**   
What are you talking about? That doesn't make sense. It's incomprehensible, like a wet piece of toast smothered in jam.   
   
**X Alter:**   
Are you trying to distance yourself from me, Master? Please allow me to stay by your side. I cannot live alone.   
   
**Agravain:**   
I will not repeat myself. You need to find a proper job.   
   
**X Alter:**   
...Ugh...   
   
**X Alter:**   
Does that mean we're no longer going to communicate?   
   
**X Alter:**   
...!?   
   
**Agravain:**   
Hm...   
   
**Agravain:**   
...That steam noise. I could never forget that sound.   
   
**X Alter:**   
..Babbagen! That tin can running on steam has managed to reach our castle!   
   
**X Alter:**   
That thing is truly the mortal enemy of all Villains. I shall slice it down with my dark sword!   
   
**Agravain:**   
Evil Sacred Sword Necro-calibur... That blade shall one day cut through even a planet.   
   
**Agravain:**   
But it still hasn't fully matured. We were foolish to believe in the specs written in the catalog. Honestly, internet shopping...   
   
**Agravain:**   
No, that's not what I mean. We did not have enough time to provide you with all that is necessary.   
   
**Agravain:**   
Learn, Alter. Go to a new land and search for a superior Master.   
   
**X Alter:**   
I...I have yet to reward the enemy with a single blade of mine.   
   
**X Alter:**   
I have put none of Master's teachings into practice.   
   
**X Alter:**   
... (Gasp) Master...what are you&mdash;   
   
**Agravain:**   
Alter. I am sealing away your memories.   
   
**X Alter:**   
...!   
   
**X Alter:**   
...Ungh...ahhh...   
   
**Agravain:**   
This is the hidden skill called “Black Knight's Black Hand.” All who call themselves knights are shackled down by the rules of example.   
   
**X Alter:**   
That's your favorite pestering Noble Phantasm, isn't it? But the Black Knight and Black Hand seem redundant.   
   
**Agravain:**   
...Just ignore the minute details, okay?   
   
**Agravain:**   
This skill shall take effect a few days from now. You will forget my name, as well.   
   
**Agravain:**   
Go, Alter.   
   
**Agravain:**   
You are Servant Universe's strongest and final Alter, and that truth shall be hidden from all.   
   
**X Alter:**   
...Master...   
   
**Agravain:**   
There's no need to be sad as we part with the promise of victory. May the Alternium be with you.   
   
**X Alter:**   
Lord Agravain...! May you have good fortune in battle!   
   
**Agravain:**   
...   
   
**X Alter:**   
(Pant...pant...) Black Knight, are you there!?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(I don't know what's going on.)  
  
---  
   
**X Alter:**   
I need you to navigate the escape pod.   
   
**X Alter:**   
Otherwise, we're going to be space dust.   
   
**X Alter:**   
The enemy...the machine soldiers...Babbagen's drones!   
   
**X Alter:**   
Ah...I can't believe they've managed to invade our secret base!   
   
**X Alter:**   
We need to break through! At any cost! Black Knight, I need your help!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Got it!)  
   
**X Alter:**   
What a cute response. It's like you're not Black Knight.   
   
**X Alter:**   
Target the memory banks! No records shall be left!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Something seems wrong here... She just said Villain...)  
   
**X Alter:**   
Yep, Villain. It means enemy. Huh? Are you complaining again?   
   
**X Alter:**   
Just because one's an enemy, that doesn't necessarily mean they're a bad guy. Just like how the hero may not always be a good guy.   
   
**X Alter:**   
But what's important right now is that we need to fight or else it's game over. Let's go!   
   
  
---  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**X Alter:**   
...Breaking away from Planet Lothian's gravitational pull. Warp preparations complete.   
   
**X Alter:**   
Check the sensors to see if anyone is following us, Black Knight.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(I don't know how to drive a spaceship...)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Huh... I'm going in and out of consciousness...)  
  
---  
   
**X Alter:**   
Are you all right?   
   
**X Alter:**   
I was pretty sloppy erasing your confidential data, so maybe that's why you're acting funny.   
   
**X Alter:**   
...   
   
**X Alter:**   
Agravain...my lord... Goodbye, my ruthless Villain Master...   
   
**X Alter:**   
May the Alternium be with you, always.   
   
## "Interlude Entracte II"  
   
**X:**   
   
(Munch munch) ...   
   
**X:**   
...Delicious! My Altrium is getting cleansed! Meat buns in the winter sure taste like justice!   
   
**X:**   
Even on a space colony, they create a man-made winter. I thought they were just stingy with the heating...   
   
**X:**   
But this alone is praiseworthy! On the other hand, red bean buns taste like corruption!   
   
**X:**   
One more... Hey! This is a red bean bun! Why that guy at Vamily Mart!   
   
**X:**   
...Hmm? I sense a Saber approaching!   
   
**X:**   
You there! You, in the sailor uniform, standing there mysteriously! Yes, you!   
   
**B：???:**  
...   
   
**X:**   
What? I'm not giving you one even if you stare at it!   
   
**X:**   
Who are you? I don't know you, but you look familiar! This is mind-boggling!   
   
**X:**   
Are you a Saber!? If you are, then you're gonna get blown away!   
   
**B：???:**  
...   
   
**X:**   
...Hm? Are you cold? And hungry? Your knees are shaking... Do you have altitude sickness?   
   
**X:**   
...   
   
**X:**   
I guess I have no choice. Consider yourself lucky you're not a Saber. And just one. You can only take one.   
   
**X:**   
Come on, hold out your hand. Whoa! It's so cold!   
   
**B：???:**  
...   
   
**B：???:**  
... (Munch...munch...)   
   
**B：???:**  
...So sweet...and warm...   
   
**X:**   
...You must have been hungry. Well, I'm not sure that even counts as a good deed.   
   
**X:**   
Out in the vastness of space, I hear there's even a hero who lets you eat his head. Could he be from the cosmic horror genre?   
   
**B：???:**  
Where...am I...?   
   
**X:**   
Did you come here without knowing?   
   
**X:**   
You're at Cosmo-Chaldea High School. It's a school attended by many young students who dream of becoming tomorrow's SSR Servants.   
   
**B：???:**  
Cosmo...Chaldea High...?   
   
**B：???:**  
I heard of a place around here with a ton of elite Masters, but I guess this isn't it.   
   
**X:**   
Master? There are plenty of annoying teachers.   
   
**C：???:**  
You've ditched class to eat out, X?   
   
**X:**   
Oh crap, Lionhead!   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
I am not currently known as Lionhead! I am God Bless Edison! GBE!   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
I am the very first principal of the glorious Cosmo-Chaldea High!   
   
**X:**   
You don't have to roar so, cathead. I can hear you. I get it.   
   
**X:**   
I just bumped into someone who I guess is a transfer student. I was about to give her a tour.   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
A noble effort, but you still owe me 50,000 super gravity squats.   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
So this is her? Hm, I did not receive any word about a transfer student...   
   
**X:**   
Hey. What's your name, by the way?   
   
**B：???:**  
My...name...   
   
**B：???:**  
...Ex...   
   
**B：???:**  
...Ex...ah...   
   
**X:**   
“Ex”? Is it just “Ex”? What a short name!   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
Look who's talking.   
   
**X:**   
I like it. It's short and sweet! All right, Ex!   
   
**Ex:**   
Ah...yes... That's...fine.   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
Very well. Ex.   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
I know you must want to enroll in this school, but it doesn't accept just anybody.   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
It's a school where heroic Servants are raised by experienced, active Servants working as teachers.   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
Thus, those who wish to enroll must have certain qualifications!   
   
**Ex:**   
...Qualifications...?   
   
**X:**   
Don't be stupid, principal! You were just complaining that the school is in the red because there were so many dropouts from the tough curriculum!   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
Those are separate issues! As different as AC and DC!   
   
**X:**   
I see. So, there's not much difference.   
   
**Ex:**   
...I want...to enroll. I want to become a great Servant.   
   
**Ex:**   
I'll make the tuition thing work. So...please...   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
It seems like your words are sincere. You have passed the first entrance exam.   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
And while we're here. X, you be her opponent.   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
We'll hold a mock battle. Based on the result of that, I shall judge whether you can enroll or not!   
   
**X:**   
Okay... It seems wrong that a student is in charge of testing another student, but I guess this is just what comes with being an upperclassman. I'll do it.   
   
**X:**   
...Heh. In other words, a part-time job with the school principal's full permission. I'll get at least a week's worth of lunch vouchers out of this!   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
No. If anything, this is a secret deal. You do know that buying food from outside vendors is prohibited.   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
I'll turn a blind eye to it if you win. Also, if you lose to her, I will double your tuition.   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
Do you think that's unreasonable? No, call me a capitalistic gentleman! It just means you're going to be paying for her tuition as well!   
   
**X:**   
So you're saying that whatever the outcome, the school won't lose anything, AND will gain another student!   
   
**X:**   
Why you, what a sharp way of thinking! It's hard to believe you're a lion. Are you by chance human!?   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
I keep telling you I'm a human! Not having any toe beans is proof!   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
Ah, no, that's not what I mean. Ex...   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
X may act rowdy like she does, ditch classes, and sometimes battle active Servants...   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
...but she is still our star pupil. She's pretty strong. She even uses ninja skills. Will you still fight?   
   
**Ex:**   
Star...   
   
**Ex:**   
Yes. I will.   
   
**Ex:**   
X, please be my opponent!   
   
**X:**   
I like that attitude! I'm not going to complain about my stomach being empty, but I wholeheartedly accept any newbies with spirit!   
   
**X:**   
Ex, this is payback for that red bean bun! Bring it on!   
   
**Ex:**   
I want to eat more sweet things!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(...Hm? Where am I?)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(This...isn't Chaldea.)  
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(I...I'm in this Voloid body again!?)  
  
---  
   
**X:**   
Ah...darn!   
   
**X:**   
Unayaaaaaabarubarubarumo!   
   
**X:**   
Special intense lectures by Nameless Red are so boring, I can't stand it!   
   
**X:**   
Doubling my tuition would've been a hundred times better&mdash;Ouch!   
   
**X:**   
Arrrgh, there's a dent on my shin now! Hmph!   
   
**X:**   
Why is there a weird black bucket in my room?   
   
**X:**   
What are you, a Voloid? Are you an invention of Professor Babbagen? You are!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(No! Ouch!)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(X, it's me!)  
  
---  
   
**X:**   
...Hmmm, I feel something in the Altrium. A presence I haven't felt since...   
   
**X:**   
...Sorry. It doesn't look like you're a defective Voloid, but electricity doesn't come free.   
   
**X:**   
Um, when do the waste collectors collect trash Voloids?   
   
**Ex:**   
Bullying...is bad. Sometimes...it gets confused.   
   
**X:**   
Hm...Ex. You still need something?   
   
**Ex:**   
That thing is with me. It's my only possession.   
   
**Ex:**   
We're going to be roommates starting today. Please be kind to me, X.   
   
**X:**   
...   
   
**X:**   
Huh!? Nobody told me this! A roommate!?   
   
**X:**   
I had...a single room all to myself, something that can't normally be enjoyed on backwater planets! My sweet, private school life...!   
   
**Ex:**   
These were the orders from the student support division, so there's no mistake. Besides, this room is obviously big enough for two students.   
   
**Ex:**   
Everything on this side of the line is my territory. This space will be our common area.   
   
**Ex:**   
Also I'm going to pull this juice bottle out of our fridge. My snacks won't fit with that inside.   
   
**X:**   
You're rolling the bottle of super extreme explosive carbonated drink, Space Sipep! Th-that'll cause an explosion!   
   
**X:**   
Now that I look closely, you look a lot like me! No wonder I did so poorly in that mock battle!   
   
**X:**   
Even though I held back! You really went all-out on me, and it hurt!   
   
**Ex:**   
That... Likewise. Thank you.   
   
**Ex:**   
There will be the two of us here from now on, so I ask you to be quieter, please.   
   
**X:**   
What the... Are you taking over the room already!? Instead of waiting for you to sleep, maybe I'll slice you up right now!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Um, no fighting, please.)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(She already has her sword out!)  
  
---  
   
**Ex:**   
Careful. Black Knight, stand back. You might get caught in X's weak beam crossfires.   
   
**X:**   
Are you calling my sword moves “weak beams”? Tsk. I didn't realize you were a Servant of sick burns. Are you perhaps a literary genius?   
   
**X:**   
Hmph, as a science buff, I don't think you and I could get along. I suggest you move to another room&mdash;   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(X is more versed in physical sports.)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Haha, science buff... Good one.)  
  
---  
   
**X:**   
Here's a lesson for you! Physical punishment! I saw it in your eyes!   
   
**X:**   
Why you! Why are you protecting that Voloid!?   
   
**Ex:**   
Because Black Knight is correct. And your reaction. You just said it yourself!   
   
**X:**   
You may be a nerd, but your swordsmanship is spot-on. I actually sense that you have some formal training in your background.   
   
**X:**   
Heh... Heh, heh. Interesting!   
   
**X:**   
Whether you be an Assassin or Berserker, if you're a Saberface, then you're definitely a Saber!   
   
**X:**   
Okay then, I'm going to get serious now! I don't have anything against you, but I will cut down all Sabers!   
   
**Ex:**   
No&mdash; That's right, I'm a Saber! Fine! That's how it will be!   
   
**Ex:**   
By thinking that, I feel like a burden has been lifted...I think.   
   
**X:**   
I understand that feeling very well! But give up, because your Saber days are over!   
   
**Girls' Dorm Supervisor:**   
   
You two are too noisy!   
   
**Girls' Dorm Supervisor:**   
Stop your fighting! If you don't, I'll put you both in swimsuits, strap you to my Noble Phantasm, and shoot you around the third moon!   
   
**Girls' Dorm Supervisor:**   
...Hey, I kicked something.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Waaahhh, I'm rolling! Stop me! Stop me!)  
  
---  
   
**X:**   
Huh?   
   
**X:**   
Ah. I cut the little guy down on accident! Sorry! I'm really sorry! Are you all right?   
   
**Ex:**   
Black Knight...   
   
**:**  
And thus the two fake Sabers began their life together. 　　　　Roommates. Roomshare. Saber rival.   
   
**:**  
At times they would fight over pudding. At times they would guess what would be on the test using darts and share a laugh...   
   
**:**  
Ex would be scolded by the dorm supervisor for staying up past midnight reading, and X for sneaking in outside food...   
   
**:**  
They would spend a difficult, yet fulfilling school life together.   
   
## "Interlude Entracte III"  
   
**:**  
No matter what they said, the two fake Sabers living together were friendly, but fought tons. And so it continued.   
   
**:**  
　　　　　　　　　　　　However...   
   
**Ex:**   
...   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
She is still not back.   
   
**Ex:**   
Principal...   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
It's been so long since we last heard Du Stallion II's jets.   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
We know so far that her disappearance has something to do with the irregular increase in Heroine Zs.   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
But we haven't seen Heroine X. How sad and lonesome...   
   
**Ex:**   
Eradicating Heroine Z was hard work. I still question what that Saber ninja evade move was.   
   
**Ex:**   
And ever since X disappeared, the Saber class students are all sighing with relief.   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
Hmm...   
   
**God Bless Edison:**   
Knowing her, she must be off saving some world in crisis. All while having no idea people are wondering where she is.   
   
**Ex:**   
I'm...just worried about all the “use by” dates on her food in the fridge.   
   
**Ex:**   
What should we do...Black Knight...?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Oh no, not this mind-only warp again!)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(She seems sad...?)  
  
---  
   
**Ex:**   
I've been having fuzzy memories lately.   
   
**Ex:**   
Some pretty men are sitting around a black round table, and they're drinking. And I'm just sitting there, looking bored...   
   
**Ex:**   
Then then someone special to me secretly gives me candy. It tasted sweet...   
   
**Ex:**   
But then the hotties disappear from their seats at the round table one by one, like petals dropping from a wilting flower.   
   
**Ex:**   
The quiet round table wasn't bad. As long as that one man was there.   
   
**Ex:**   
Being in my empty room reminds me of that scene.   
   
**Ex:**   
A knock. ...Come in.   
   
**Ex:**   
...?   
   
**Ex:**   
Why aren't you coming in? Is the door broken?   
   
**B：???:**  
I'm just killing time in the halls, Lizardlet.   
   
**B：???:**  
I don't mind people seeing us talking, but I don't want our conversation to be recorded.   
   
**Ex:**   
You're disguising your voice? Who are you? What do you want?   
   
**B：???:**  
I'll just say that I'm a classmate. Spies for the Villain Alliance are everywhere.   
   
**B：???:**  
Even in this school of heroic Servants.   
   
**Ex:**   
Villain...Alliance... Inside the school...   
   
**Ex:**   
...In a way, I'm relieved. You seem to be an elite agent.   
   
**Ex:**   
Not like that striped-pants Elisa, who always herself caught in the traps she sets for X and me.   
   
**Ex:**   
I was so worried she might be the spy. But it looks like I was wrong.   
   
**B：???:**  
   
Gwah! A-ahem!   
   
**B：???:**  
...They will soon come for you. Be ready to meet them.   
   
**B：???:**  
I'm talking about those who believe you have fighting potential, after the reports they've received from spies here.   
   
**B：???:**  
A large-scale attack by the Villains will soon start. It'll be a Death Tour, with enough power to destroy an entire planet.   
   
**B：???:**  
Heroine X will likely not return. And even if she did, she could not save this place.   
   
**B：???:**  
See you, docile Berserker. School life with you was quite entertaining.   
   
**Ex:**   
...   
   
**Ex:**   
Leave...the school...   
   
**Ex:**   
I knew that this day, would come. I didn't think X would be first. But.   
   
**Ex:**   
But...there is still something I need to do.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(I have a bad feeling about this...)  
   
**Ex:**   
You don't have to be so worried, Black Knight.   
   
**Ex:**   
I secretly collected parts bit by bit, so you've powered up quite a bit.   
   
**Ex:**   
If you can help me again...that would be great.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Ex wears leggings...)  
   
**Ex:**   
Black Knight...your eye movements are a little creepy.   
   
**Ex:**   
Maybe there's still some weird programming left. I'm going to change, so go out in the hall.   
   
**Ex:**   
Come on, hurry.   
   
  
---  
   
**Babbagen:**   
Beep boop. So you were the one who called me out here to the dark side of the school.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
Data extraction. Found: a traditional school yard callout to settle old scores. In other words, there's an one hundred percent possibility that a secret art will be passed on due to graduation.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
...Good. Preparing to deploy Noble Phantasm for self-defense.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
With my fantasy, my ideal, my dream...the time has come for you to awaken to the appeal of steam!   
   
**Ex:**   
...No, that's not what we're talking about. I wanted to ask you some personal questions before the battle started, Professor Babbagen.   
   
**Ex:**   
I know you are busy, and you are not around the school much. Tonight was my only chance.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
...Hm. Steam pressure...dropping. What kind of lecture do you desire, Servant candidate?   
   
**Ex:**   
Please tell me...   
   
**Ex:**   
On the planet Lothian, I believe you once battled against a dark lord.   
   
**Ex:**   
That information is strictly confidential, and it is not even in the school's database. Could you tell me the details...   
   
**Ex:**   
And tell me what fate befell the black lord!?   
   
**Babbagen:**   
Confidential data, number SA80T521X. Punitive expedition of the planet Lothian.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
Such information is strictly confidential. Of course, revealing such information to a common student candidate is not permissible.   
   
**Ex:**   
All right, then! I have no choice but to tear our your memory media and read it myself!   
   
**Ex:**   
And...above all...   
   
**Ex:**   
My heart...is burning and screaming at me that I need to defeat you!   
   
**Babbagen:**   
Hm. I am a gentleman, and a scholar who abhors physical violence.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
Yet I am also aware that I must defend myself against any attack. Student or not, I will not hold back.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
Your burning heart... Show me if it can best my steam power armor!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Babbagen:**   
...Left and right manipulators...stopped. I have sustained critical damage.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
...Candidate Ex.   
   
**Ex:**   
Yes, Professor Babbagen.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
You were a good student. A truly good student. You were one of the few who sincerely listened to my lectures.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
You sat in front of the class, and I remember you always wiping your fogged up glasses.   
   
**Ex:**   
...It was tough. It was as tough as eating mochi topped with powdered chestnut without hands...   
   
**Babbagen:**   
...You have utterly defeated me.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
You so accurately pinpointed my armor's weaknesses. I can think of no better sign that you studied well.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
I do not have enough information to understand the entire situation, but I can hypothesize about the outcome.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
Ex, you are planning to leave, are you not?   
   
**Ex:**   
Professor, I...   
   
**Ex:**   
I just couldn't like you. I couldn't help this hatred I felt toward you.   
   
**Ex:**   
But I always liked your lectures. I truly did.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
...Ah, a student completes her studies and departs. That is every teacher's joy...   
   
**Babbagen:**   
As your reward, I shall tell you. The dark lord's name is... “Sir Agravain.”   
   
**Ex:**   
Agra...vain...!   
   
**Babbagen:**   
He was a senior member of the group called the Dark R.O.U.N.D.S.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
As the descendant of a clan that alchemizes artificial Servants, the work he inherited was truly evil.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
The Heroine Zs earlier were just incomplete fakes. What he was searching for was something beyond that... A crystallized form of magecraft.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
But we have been able to determine that he was not successful.   
   
**Ex:**   
...   
   
**Babbagen:**   
Agravain fought valiantly, but he was no match for the overwhelming pressure of my steam.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
In the end, he tumbled down into the castle's reactor core.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
Whether it was accidental or intentional, I cannot say.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
Not long after, the castle collapsed.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
We conducted a thorough search, but were unable to locate his body.   
   
**Babbagen:**   
At the same time, the secret ceremonial rites for the creation of artificial Servants were also lost. That's what I...report...ed.   
   
**Ex:**   
Professor...Professor Babbagen.   
   
**Ex:**   
...Ungh.   
   
**Ex:**   
Agravain...Agravain...!   
   
**Ex:**   
My Master... Revenge...!   
   
**Ex:**   
...   
   
**Ex:**   
...It's impossible...   
   
**???:**  
Aren't you going to finish him off? Wouldn't that be more elegant?   
   
**Ex:**   
...!   
   
**???:**  
Encased within his armor, the critical steam will release, cutting off his vision and breathing, and soon after, a world of extreme cold will await him.   
   
**???:**  
He's an extremely troublesome enemy.   
   
**???:**  
...iii...   
   
**Ex:**   
...Are you the one who is here to get me, as the agent said?   
   
**???:**  
...Indeed, Lord Pendragon.   
   
**???:**  
The final knight of the fallen Dark R.O.U.N.D.S. ...To think you would be hiding here, right under his nose.   
   
**???:**  
...Hmph. The villain may not always be evil, while the “good guy” may not always be working for the weak.   
   
**???:**  
A school intended to educate heroic Servants? Laughable. You know that the moment it becomes a public facility, it also becomes a pawn of those in power, don't you?   
   
**???:**  
Never mind. Now we need to think of how to deal with you, Lord Pendragon.   
   
**???:**  
The reports said you had lost your memories, but by the look of it, you seem to understand what is going on.   
   
**Ex:**   
Pendragon... Yes, that is the True Name I was given.   
   
**X Alter:**   
My name is Heroine X Alter. The Ultimate Anti-Anti-Saber Weapon!   
   
**???:**  
Hahahahaha! Wonderful. Let us celebrate your new journey!   
   
**???:**  
I welcome you as a new member of the Villain Alliance. You shall serve me directly!   
   
**???:**  
Admittedly, I am an outsider within the Alliance. But that means you will have absolute freedom in your job! What a wonderful position!   
   
**X Alter:**   
...I see. I'm actually more keen on being told what to do.   
   
**X Alter:**   
But I do have one wish.   
   
**X Alter:**   
I would like to take one Voloid with me. AUX Voloid K6-X4.   
   
**???:**  
Hm? What a piece of junk. Fine. Doesn't look like much, though.   
   
**???:**  
Board my container-shaped infiltration ship. We will return at once to the mothership, and convene with the other alliance members.   
   
**X Alter:**   
Please, give me ninety seconds to prepare.   
   
**???:**  
Understood. I will await you in the ship.   
   
**X Alter:**   
...Black Knight. I have...something to ask you.   
   
**X Alter:**   
I finally figured out what was wrong with you.   
   
**X Alter:**   
You have a tiny shard of crystallized Alternium embedded in your head. It was being used to track me.   
   
**X Alter:**   
That crystal had been receiving mana waves leaking through the cracks of multidimensional space.   
   
**X Alter:**   
It seems, coincidentally, that you were on the same wavelength as someone else's mind. They would appear to be a mage.   
   
**X Alter:**   
But we are headed to a battlefield. Information leaks and unknown elements cannot be permitted.   
   
**X Alter:**   
I'm going to remove the cause of the problem.   
   
**X Alter:**   
Maybe you're still listening to my words through this Black Knight as a vessel.   
   
**X Alter:**   
If you are...I would like to say goodbye.   
   
**X Alter:**   
Having someone listen to me when I needed it... I think that was nice.   
   
**X Alter:**   
When I succeed, and make a name for myself as a Servant...maybe we can talk like this again.   
   
**X Alter:**   
When that time comes...   
   
**X Alter:**   
No, that's just wishful thinking. She and my deceased Master would both laugh at that thought.   
   
**X Alter:**   
See you. Whoever it is, from a Servant Universe far, far away...   
   
**X Alter:**   
May the Alternium be with you, always...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Whoa! Chaldea!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Did I fall asleep?  
  
---  
   
**X:**   
Have you awoken, Master? How was sleeping at the nice warm kotatsu?   
   
**X:**   
It was good? I'm glad to hear! But Mash seems to be a little disappointed.   
   
**Mash:**   
...!   
   
**X:**   
She seems to have kind of made a hobby of watching Master sleep. I don't understand that allure at all!   
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, ah! Shhhhh. X, I told you to please keep that a secret...!   
   
**Mash:**   
This kotatsu we inherited from Doctor's room is a Noble Phantasm to be feared!   
   
**Mash:**   
Um... It's so that Senpai will remain healthy...   
   
**X:**   
Let's just keep it that way. This mikan is delicious! This iyokan citrus is sour!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Heroine X... I just saw someone with your face?  
   
**X:**   
What? Is there something on my face? (Sigh) Fine. Then have a good look at it.   
   
**Mash:**   
H-hey! Please! Both of you! Your faces are too close!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(This one wears bloomers...)  
   
**X:**   
Wha...? This is a special spacesuit! It's a wardrobe essential for those who follow the Star of Altria!   
   
**X:**   
Well, they were on sale at the school's store, so I bought them all up.   
   
**Mash:**   
What are you talking about?   
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
(Sigh) ...Master, were you dreaming? Eh? Not a dream!?   
   
**Mash:**   
Hm...hm... Those are some hazy details.   
   
**X:**   
Eh? Did I ever have a BFF?   
   
**X:**   
Oh, come on. I don't remember anything like that. Sounds like space opera nonsense to me!   
   
**X:**   
But...yeah. I did have someone I considered a troublesome rival.   
   
**X:**   
Oh? You want to hear all about it? Uh... Well, it's not really an interesting story...   
   
**X:**   
It's not like I defeated a space dragon, or won first place in a race through the Saint Quartz Run...   
   
**X:**   
This story isn't as flashy as all that. It's just a story about ordinary school life.   
   
**X:**   
Sheesh. I wonder how she's doing... That Saber who was energized by Japanese sweets...   
   
**X:**   
No, no. Forget about that. Let's talk about releasing the long-awaited EPII!   
   
**X:**   
I got excited thinking this quest was going to be about that, so I've been waiting patiently next to Master this whole time!   
   
**Mash:**   
I-is that so? Anyway, it looks like you are still going to be talking.   
   
**Mash:**   
We have run out of both mikan and tea, so I shall go get some more.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks, Mash. What would you like, X?  
  
---  
   
**X:**   
Any Japanese sweets. We are sitting at a kotatsu, after all.   
   
**X:**   
Sometimes the flavor of corruption isn't so bad!   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, understood. I shall go check the kitchen!
