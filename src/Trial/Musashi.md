# Trial Quest - Miyamoto Musashi  
  
## Intruder  
   
**A：???:**  
I can't believe this!   
   
**???:**  
...   
   
**A：???:**  
Whoa, hold on! You were cheating! I didn't even see when you drew your sword!   
   
**A：???:**  
Seriously, cut that out! What kind of nonsense is a move I can't see even after I already saw through your movement!? You think people can just swing their swords around like chopsticks or something!?   
   
**???:**  
Strength is not from the body alone, but from a state of perfect zen, and absolute purity. That was the ultimate strike, one I spent my entire career as a swordsman perfecting.   
   
**???:**  
And yet, you were able to parry it somehow. I didn't pay much attention to this twaddle about “the greatest swordsman under heaven,” since it sounded like you made it up...   
   
**???:**  
...But now, I must cut you down. No matter what, I must cut you down.   
   
**A：???:**  
Wait! Waitwaitwait! No way, I don't fight when I can't win!   
   
**A：???:**  
Besides, you tricked me! What do you mean the name “Yagyu of Edo” is meaningless!?   
   
**A：???:**  
Your skill with a sword is godlike! The people who told me your style was child's play lied!   
   
**???:**  
...Of course. Only the one who rules our nation knows the truth of my skill. Such is not meant for the likes of lowly peasants.   
   
**???:**  
If you want to curse anything for being cut down in the middle of the street, curse your own aura as a swordsman.   
   
**A：???:**  
...Well, I can't really complain since I was the one who picked a fight with you... Wait, no, I will complain!   
   
**A：???:**  
Shouldn't a powerful swordsman and government official like you just ignore taunts from a wanderer like me!?   
   
**A：???:**  
But no! Not only did you ambush me, but you weren't even taking the fight seriously!?   
   
**A：???:**  
That's not fair! You bully! Bullying the weak is bad!   
   
**???:**  
...   
   
**A：???:**  
(...Looking at him, it seems nothing I say will matter anymore. This old geezer is unlike any opponent I've faced before.)   
   
**A：???:**  
(I can't see his attacks. I can't win. I guess this is the end of the road for me... Hm?)   
   
**???:**  
...Hm.   
   
**A：???:**  
YES! It's that thing again! Thank you, O merciful bodhisattva!   
   
**A：???:**  
Since it looks like luck is on my side, I better take advantage of it and run! Sorry, but our fight ends here, Yagyu...something!   
   
**A：???:**  
I won't taunt you again, so just forget about me! Bye!   
   
**???:**  
...   
   
**A：???:**  
Phew, that worked! I'm getting so dizzy right noooooow!   
   
**???:**  
...She's gone. To think she would be versed in the demon arts as well as swordsmanship.   
   
**???:**  
I may have injured her, but her head is still on her shoulders... To survive my secret technique not once, but twice...   
   
**???:**  
Shinmen Musashi-no-Kami Fujiwara-no-Harunobu. I will never forget your name.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Wait...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...This is...  
   
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I've seen this place before?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...This looks familiar...  
   
  
---  
   
**A：???:**  
...Ugh... Hmmm... Argh, my head hurts...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Someone has collapsed!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hey, are you okay!?  
   
  
---  
   
**A：???:**  
...! This is nothing, I can still fight!   
   
**A：???:**  
Wait... Huh? Who...are you? Where's that scary old geezer?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...You... You were about to kill me...  
   
**A：???:**  
Sorry about that! Y'know, if you tell me what's going on, I'll be even MORE apologetic. I'll even buy you a bowl of udon after!   
   
**A：???:**  
But, before that...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...No, who are YOU?  
   
**A：???:**  
I asked the question first. You're dressed funny... Hmm, looks like you're from another country?   
   
**A：???:**  
In any case...   
   
  
---  
   
**A：???:**  
You, unfamiliar foreigner! Before you name yourself, you must answer this!   
   
**A：???:**  
Who in the world am I!? And where exactly is this!?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...You lost your memories?  
   
  
---  
   
**A：???:**  
Yes, it seems that way. I must have hit my head hard, and forgot who I am.   
   
**A：???:**  
So, I'd appreciate it if you could tell me my name. Oh, but if you don't know, that's fine too.   
   
**A：???:**  
If you could just point me to a nearby tea shop, I'll handle the rest myself.   
   
**A：???:**  
So? Do you know my name? Do you know anything about this place?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I'm sorry...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm afraid I don't know either...  
   
  
---  
   
**A：???:**  
I see... Yup, then nothing I can do. This stuff happens.   
   
**A：???:**  
Sorry for asking so much. Anyway, let's get back to the introduction.   
   
**A：???:**  
What's your name? My memories don't matter, but I can't call someone I just met “Hey You,” right?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fujimaru.  
   
  
---  
   
**A：???:**  
Okay, Fujimaru. I'm sorry about slashing at you just now.   
   
**A：???:**  
You revived me, right? After I passed out? Well, it looks like no one stole anything off me...   
   
**A：???:**  
It seems luck is on my side again this time. For someone as cute as you...   
   
**A：???:**  
...No, for someone as pure-hearted as you to wake me up.   
   
**Oni B:**   
Heh...hehe! This new year is starting off great for us!   
   
**Oni B:**   
Hey, partner! We've got some humans washed up over here! TWO OF THEM!   
   
**Oni B:**   
Look at that one, tasty-looking meat and nice clothes! She even got swords around her waist!   
   
**Oni B:**   
That [♂ guy /♀ girl] over there, though... No flair at all. No swords, no fancy getup...   
   
**Oni B:**   
But perfect for physical labor! Let's grab [♂ him /♀ her] so [♂ he /♀ she] can make our meals!   
   
**Oni A:**   
...Not bad. It's about time we started aiming higher.   
   
**Oni A:**   
A full-fledged oni has human slaves. It will keep those weirdos staying at the gate in check.   
   
**Oni A:**   
Hey, you two humans there. If you don't want to die, come quietly and do as we say.   
   
**Oni A:**   
If you resist, we won't have any choice: we'll have to hurt one of you. Real bad.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Go on! Run!  
   
**A：???:**  
Of course. If running would take care of it, I'd be happy to. But, it doesn't seem like running will do the trick.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can you fight?  
   
**A：???:**  
Hmm... My memory's hazy... Can't even remember my own name... Still, I'm guessing this isn't something we can just run away from, so...   
   
  
---  
   
**A：???:**  
I mean, those are real oni, right? Here we go again... I always end up in weird places like this.   
   
**A：???:**  
Fine, I shall fight! Fujimaru, I'll trust you to cover me!   
   
**A：???:**  
I don't know where you idiots came from, but you sure have guts, talking weird trash like that to a couple of strangers who washed up on a beach!   
   
**A：???:**  
I can tolerate thieves, miscreants, oni, centipede monsters...even Osakabe-hime! But I just can't stand evil jerks like you!   
   
**A：???:**  
Now, an honest match, you oni-looking villains! Playtime is over. I'll send you back to hell!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Oni B:**   
   
Eeeeeek! What's with this human!? She's super strong!   
   
**Oni A:**   
That dual sword stance... Ferocious, yet perfectly controlled... The flexibility and ability to adapt to any and all situations...   
   
**Oni A:**   
This woman... Don't tell me... She's the famous Miyamoto Musashi! The one who killed off all the disciples of the Yoshioka school!   
   
**Oni B:**   
   
Whaaat!? You know of her, partner!?   
   
**Oni A:**   
Indeed. I once devoted myself to the way of the sword. I'm familiar with all the famous swordsmen.   
   
**Oni A:**   
This woman is Miyamoto Musashi, without a doubt! No, but... Woman... A woman...?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Miyamoto Musashi...!  
   
**Musashi:**   
...Mmm, I guess that's my name. Sounds right to me.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Do you know about me, Fujimaru? Is the name Miyamoto Musashi famous or something?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Apparently your name is Musashi.  
   
**Musashi:**   
Yeah. Sounds about right to me, so let's go with that.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Although... I can't remember what kind of person this “Musashi” is... Well, she's probably a good-for-nothing person!   
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
In any case, we're still in the middle of a match. Hey, oni, thanks for telling me my name.   
   
**Oni B:**   
   
Eeek! If that's Musashi, there's no way we'd win! Sorry, Sukeroku, die for me!   
   
**Oni A:**   
   
Whoa, don't push me to the front! What are you, an evil oni!? Oh... Wait... Yeah...   
   
**Oni A:**   
Ugh arrrgh! I'm going to die here!   
   
**Oni A:**   
...Hm? I'm not dead? I'm still alive?   
   
**Oni A:**   
You mean Musashi let me live? The same Musashi they say kills everyone she meets?   
   
**Musashi:**   
Where did you hear that?   
   
**Musashi:**   
My memory is still hazy right now, but I won't cut down an opponent who's lost the will to fight.   
   
**Musashi:**   
We're not at war or anything. Isn't it a bit barbaric to kill someone on first sight?   
   
**Musashi:**   
If I can scare away my opponent through intimidation, that's a perfect victory.   
   
**Musashi:**   
All I want's money and fame. Killing my opponents will only make people hate me!   
   
**Oni A:**   
I-is that so...? You say that, but each of your attacks was powerful enough to kill...   
   
**Musashi:**   
Well, yeah. Obviously. I didn't practice my bladework just so I could go easy on opponents.   
   
**Musashi:**   
That said, I don't need a trail of blood and corpses following me. Only a true swordsman can stop a slash mid-strike.   
   
**Musashi:**   
I don't fight if there's nothing in it for me. Lemme see...   
   
**Musashi:**   
Weeell, if you have a bounty on your head, I'mma cut it off and get that bounty! But you don't... Do you?   
   
**Musashi:**   
You don't look like you got a lotta money, or like someone'd be paying for your head.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Okay, then! Hate the sin, not the...um...oni. You know what? Just consider yourself lucky, and forget about me!   
   
**Oni A:**   
...   
   
**Musashi:**   
Right! Since I think I know my name now, let me reintroduce myself. I am Miyamoto Musashi! Probably.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Nice to meetcha, Fujimaru! For now, let's head to the tea shop I see on top of that ridge!   
   
## Interlude : First Gate  
   
**Musashi:**   
I see. Chaldea, Servants, and Rayshifts, oh my...   
   
**Musashi:**   
I've never heard of any of those, but I have an idea of who you are now.   
   
**Musashi:**   
And you're saying I'm one of those so-called Servants?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
With that dual-wielding stance? Definitely.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Musashi was a famous hero and swordsman.  
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
...Hmm... That doesn't sound right... I definitely don't remember getting treated like a hero, or a famed swordsman...   
   
**Musashi:**   
And it's not just 'cause I don't remember much about myself, y'know?   
   
**Musashi:**   
That kinda...makes my nose itchy. I can just feel that something about that's a bit off.   
   
**Musashi:**   
I don't think I'm the same swordsman you know of, Fujimaru. That's for sure, but...   
   
**Musashi:**   
Eh, the little stuff can wait! Let's fill up our tummies first!   
   
**Musashi:**   
Miss, bring more dumplings! Also, bring me some udon! Plain or not doesn't matter, just gimme what you got!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Losing your memory doesn't bother you?  
   
**Musashi:**   
Tee hee hee. Just knowing my name's making this better.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Besides, there's no use worrying about what you don't know, right?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Do you have any money?  
   
**Musashi:**   
...! Don't tell me... Fujimaru, you don't have any money?   
   
**Musashi:**   
Hmm... Okay, let's just sell the shop owner something of ours! This sword guard is quite well-crafted, no?   
   
**Musashi:**   
Don't worry, if I sell it, it'll cover travel expenses for a while. I'll share some with you too, Fujimaru.   
   
**Musashi:**   
I mean, selling it'll kinda ruin its legacy and stuff... Eh! Luckily, I still have other swords.   
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
Anywho, you woke up on this island, and you remember having being here before... Am I correct?   
   
**Musashi:**   
How did you get back to your original world before? I wonder if that strange hole is somewhere on this island, too?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Original world...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't tell me... You, too?  
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
Yep! Already got used to it. Happens to me a lot. I just kinda meander into weird worlds.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Last time, I ended up in the western part of this place called “America.” I had to fight a bunch of guys with pistols.   
   
**Musashi:**   
The priestess that took care of me then said that I was a stranger.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Apparently, I'm the sort who gets spirited away all the time. That's why I end up in all sorts of places.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Usually, there's a hole to return to the original world nearby. So, long as I can find it, I can get back to the previous world.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A swordsman who Rayshifts without realizing it...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Isn't that a big deal...?  
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
Naaah! That's just how things have always been for me! It's not like I'm dying or anything!   
   
**B：???:**  
I see. Openhearted and cheerful like in all the stories.   
   
**B：???:**  
Even in a predicament that would kill an ordinary person, she just shrugs it off... I'm at a loss for words.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The oni from earlier!  
   
  
---  
   
**B：???:**  
No, hold on, Master from Chaldea.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
I am Sukeroku. Raiden-no-Sukeroku. Caretaker of the fields and farms on this island.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
An oni making a meager living in Onigashima, a land that lost its master and is now fated to disappear.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
I couldn't help but be concerned about that woman saying she was Musashi. That's why I followed you...   
   
**Musashi:**   
Oh, right. Don't just stand there. Care to sit next to me?   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
No, I can't sit next to Miyamoto Musashi, even if you're only claiming to be him. I'm afraid my head would come toppling off my shoulders at any moment.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
I think I'd prefer to stand. ...Also, I came here bearing good news.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Onigashima is an island someone created, then abandoned. This place doesn't exist in the real world anymore.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
This is the boundary of dreams and illusions.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
These days, the only visitors we get are oni with nowhere else to go... Just like us...   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
But today must be quite the special day. Many travelers have wandered into this dream.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Three great oni occupying the gates. A Master of Chaldea washing up ashore.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
And, a lady swordsman calling herself Miyamoto Musashi tumbles into a place she's wholly unconnected to.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Each of you with unknown origins, but doubtless foreigners. If so, you want to return to your native worlds, yes?   
   
**Musashi:**   
Yes. The dumplings here suck!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I really do need to get back to Chaldea...  
   
  
---  
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Well, then matters are simple. Head for the summit of Onigashima.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
“Her” shrine still sits on the summit of Onigashima. A sanctuary shrouded in her divine aura.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
This world's god will reject anything that's deemed unnecessary.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Given that, foreigners like you should get “bounced back” to your original world the moment you reach the summit.   
   
**Musashi:**   
That's splendid. Thanks for the advice, Lord Raiden-no-Sukeroku.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
S-sure, you did spare my life, so I owed you one. No need to than&ndash;   
   
**Musashi:**   
Okay! I, Fujimaru, and Lord Sukeroku, shall proceed to the summit of Onigashima!   
   
**Musashi:**   
We just need to go past that gate in the distance, right? You can guide us, hold our luggage, and make our meals!   
   
**Musashi:**   
Oh, and I'm not really asking. I'm telling.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Defy me, and I'll give you some PAIN! So, better just do what I say!   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
   
Whaaaaaat!?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Politeness x oppression = Musashi's power...!)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(And now we have yet another weirdo Saber...)  
   
  
---  
   
**Sukeroku:**   
In the first place, Miyamoto Musashi is known as the most powerful swordsman in the history of Japan. He is said to have lived in the early Edo period.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
The “Niten Ichiryu” he created is a style that utilized both long and short swords, and is considered the quintessential “dual-wielding style” in Japan.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
The many duels Musashi fought with other swordmasters while he was in his twenties are known across the land, and serve as inspiration for a great deal of literature and entertainment.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Among us oni, Musashi is synonymous with the dual-wielding style, and is both feared and loved at the same time.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
So much so that many oni children would swing around two clubs pretending to be Musashi.   
   
**Musashi:**   
The Niten Ichiryu... The Book of Five Rings... The Throne of Void... Ah... I am starting to remember things...   
   
**Musashi:**   
I haven't reached the fifth blade yet.   
   
**Musashi:**   
When I was out in the Sagami area in hopes of training, I met a strange old man in a gazebo while sheltering from the rain...   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
...I see. They say Musashi was born in Ohara, Sakushu.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
His father's name was Shinmen Munisai, the martial arts coach of the Shinmen clan in Takeyama Castle. His lord was the one who gave him the name “Shinmen.”   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Munisai set up a dojo for jitte skills in Miyamoto, Yoshino. Musashi considered this home, so later used Miyamoto as a surname...   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Stories of Miyamoto Musashi are popular, but Shinmen Munisai was incredibly skilled as well.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Consider that the name he gave himself is “Muni,” which means “unique.” You have to be quite skilled to consider calling yourself that!   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
To be unique is to be the singular, ultimate one. In other words, it's a show of a powerful ego asserting none follow in his footsteps.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Musashi, his son, calling his own style “Niten” is surely respect for his great father&mdash;   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Hmm? I'm getting a chill somehow. Do oni catch colds as well?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Musashi is totally glaring at you!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't know why, but don't talk about her dad!  
   
  
---  
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Oh! Right! There's not much point in trying to recount Musashi's history with her standing right here, is there? It's certainly nothing she doesn't know!   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Sorry about that. A slip of the tongue. It's just, none of the oni are interested in stories of this sort, so...   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
I... I can't help but be attracted to swords. Because of that, I've spent a lot of time rifling through books and documents alone.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Well, I've never heard of any oni versed in swordsmanship. On the other hand, I have heard of people becoming oni-like in pursuit of swordsmanship.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Oh well, I already knew that was the version of the story in your world.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait, what do you mean?

**Musashi:**   
In my world, Shinmen Munisai was as violent as a storm,   
   
**Musashi:**   
and his child was abandoned simply because she was a girl.   
   
**Musashi:**   
But wait! She wasn't discouraged by the abandonment! Nope! She built a shed to live right under that bastard father's nose!   
   
**Musashi:**   
I don't know what kind of swordsman Miyamoto Musashi was in the worlds of Lord Sukeroku or Fujimaru.   
   
**Musashi:**   
But in MY world, “Miyamoto Musashi” is still a nameless swordsman that lives each day in self-indulgence.   
   
**Musashi:**   
...Well, someone once told me I was from a world that went toootally off the rails&ndash;a Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon. That's why I'm different than the other Musashi, they said.   
   
**Musashi:**   
But the Musashi in your world became famous? That's pretty awesome.   
   
**Musashi:**   
When you get down to it, Miyamoto Musashi is just a careless sorta fellow. But in his version, he was at least able to touch the Throne of Void.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Throne of Void...?  
   
  
---  
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon...? I've never heard the term before. What does it mean?   
   
**Musashi:**   
Who knows? Perhaps it's a destiny like the morning dew. I don't know all that much myself.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
This is the first great gate. This was the gate Kazakoemaru guarded in the past...   
   
**C：???:**  
Hoooooohohoho! How dare you show up, seedy bald oni and country girl who doesn't even have a long-sleeved kimono!   
   
**C：???:**  
It's the New Year! The first dawn of the year! The neighborhood overflows with New Year gifts and the pharaoh's sun!   
   
**C：???:**  
No day is as joyous as today! In other words... Yes, in other words, it's MY turn!   
   
**C：???:**  
Hiiiyah!   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Hiiiyah!   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
...   
   
**Musashi:**   
...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
   
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Eh... What is this... This quiet as if this was a mall where every store was shuttered and closed...   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...That was a mistake. Making an elegant and conservative entrance just because it is the New Year... What was I thinking!?   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Right! A pharaoh must be brazen like the glimmering sun for any and every occasion!   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Just like the great Ozymandias! And Nitocris!   
   
**Nitocris:**   
You know I'm not like that.   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Yes! I appreciate your support from the bottom of my heart, Pharaoh Nitocris!   
   
**Nitocris:**   
That's... That's really not...what I meant...   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
All right! Now that I have my support, let's try this again!   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Hiiiiyah!   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Hooohohoho! Surprised you made it here, scrawny ugly oni and girl with three Buster Cards!   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
But your advance ends here! I will not allow any further violence!   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
That's because... Yes, that's because... I'm going to turn this island into my second castle!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Second castle...!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She...she wouldn't repeat the nightmare of Castle Csejte!  
   
  
---  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Right! I couldn't borrow a pyramid from Pharaoh Ozymandias this time...   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...But I have superior money management skills! Give me three days, and this gate will be renovated into a classy spa!   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Once I'm done, you will all be able to rest to your heart's content! The first three days of the year are special, so take it easy!   
   
**Musashi:**   
Really? We have no money but you'll let us stay in an inn?   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Heh, of course, samurai girl. That obi you have is quite exquisite! I am always looking for new girlfriends!   
   
**Musashi:**   
So she says. No idea what she's talking about, but she seems awfully generous, I guess?   
   
**Musashi:**   
It's the New Year, right? How about we forget about going to the summit and just rest here?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You realize she's going to put you to work, right?  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Heh... To think you would call me out on that. I expect nothing less from the Master who saved humanity.   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Six hours per shift, two shifts a day, each separated by a six-hour break.   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
With this miraculous labor law, I can turn a single working day into two. That's how you lot will build my new castle!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Our New Year's vacation will end!  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
...!   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
N-no, you can take longer than those special three days. I mean, some schools are taking the entire week off, no?   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Who knows? I heard people are starting to work a lot sooner now.   
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
...I knew it! She runs a shady business!   
   
**Musashi:**   
The only real miracle in the world should be udon! Let's defeat her and move on!   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
She holds her head so high...! Not only do you not go with my plan, but you accuse me of running a shady business! Now I MUST fight!   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I am the final heir of the Pharaoh Fighting Style... The very incarnation of beauty, Cleopatra VII Philopator!   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
I don't know what Heroic Spirit you are, but I'm not just a supreme beauty!   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
What... Pharaoh Fighting Style...!?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You know of it, Raiden!?  
   
  
---  
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Yes... In a land far to the west, someone devised a magical attack strengthened by pompous acts and laughs!   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
The more pompous and cocky you act, the greater king you become... To think those are the requirements to inherit such a fighting style...   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Obviously, I don't need to tell you that once you inherit the style, you always look at people with your head held&mdash;   
   
**Musashi:**   
Okay, stand back, Lord Sukeroku! That girl's weapon is a sickle chain as big as Baiken's!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Kyaaah...!   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Amazing! The match is over!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Winner, Shinmen Musashi-no-Kami!  
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
Ah, hearing that declaration of the victor felt so good! Thanks, Fujimaru!   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
Tch... You people don't know a good opportunity when you see one!   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
This is where you should be praising me! This is your chance to receive the greatest New Year gift ever: my unparalleled beauty!   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
But I will not give up! My dream of a fitness boot camp island&mdash;   
   
**Cleopatra:**   
For the sake of my dear Caesar, I will make Cleopatra Fitness Island a reality!   
   
**Musashi:**   
Huh? She disappeared. I didn't even hit her that hard, though...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She went back to Chaldea.  
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
I see. Glad I didn't end up killing her. Okay, moving on!   
   
**Musashi:**   
From the look of things, these, um... Servants, you call them? I bet they'll be at the other gates, too.   
   
**Musashi:**   
It'll be good if we can talk things out with them, but if we have to fight, that's fine too!   
   
**Musashi:**   
Wielding my sword will probably restore my memories, and I'm happy for any chance to fight a strong opponent!   
   
## Interlude : Second Gate  
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof:**   
Hahaha! Master here on New Year's, welcome! I am the dream cat guarding the second gate.   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof:**   
My name is Tamamo Cat Woof! There will be no lounging around a kotatsu eating mandarin oranges here!   
   
**Musashi:**   
Now it's a fox-girl? Fujimaru, your friends are weird.   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof:**   
Of course! Master has an A Rank in Endurance, and will listen to even the ramblings of a wild cat with patience!   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof:**   
However. However...! This cat is ticked!   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof:**   
I've been carefully getting ready for a nice traditional New Year's meal since the end of last year...   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof:**   
I was willing to skip the last battle for it. Honestly, being an all-star is so annoying.   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof:**   
So I was peeling my shrimp, resolved to duck out of any battles...   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof:**   
When Master... Master... Master ordered the New Years meal at a convenience store!   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof:**   
And [♂ he /♀ she] even ordered one for me! So considerate! But that turned out to just really make me angry!   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Ah... That's no good. Don't you know why New Year's meals are so elaborate, kid?   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
They're made of food that lasts so that the lady of the house doesn't have to cook for three days straight.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
And they're made elaborately and lovingly with as many of the husband's favorite foods as possible. It's their way of showing their gratitude at the end of the year.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh?  
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
Yes... They say New Year's Day dictates the rest of the year, you know. So traditionally for the wife, pleasing her significant other with a homemade New Year's meal...   
   
**Musashi:**   
...is a way to infuse the relationship with love, spirit, joy, and mutual support for the whole year ahead!   
   
**Musashi:**   
And you just went out and got a store-bought one...? Even my jerk dad gets quiet in front of a New Year's meal...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh!?  
   
  
---  
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof:**   
That's right! This kitty's chest is about to burst with sadness!   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof:**   
Actually, it did burst. And the result was&mdash;   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof Woof:**   
Happy New Year, Master! I am Tamamo Cat Woof Woof, the hawk!   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof Woof Woof:**   
Never get store-bought meals! I'm Tamamo Cat Woof Woof Woof, and I'm taking it to the danger zone!   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof:**   
As you can see, the sadness split my heart into three pieces! And the result was the raging feline, Tamamo Cat.   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof Woof:**   
Hehehe. One's good enough, and now there's two more of us. You're gonna need a whole lot of carrots!   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof Woof:**   
Now we have no choice but to open up a maid café, or rather a maid CATfé! But where do we get the cats?   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof Woof Woof:**   
Impressive, a maid enterprising enough to open up a café! How modern! Does that make Master the café owner?   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof:**   
That's right, kitties! So let's grab our Master!   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof:**   
Open Caaaaaats! Eagle, Jaguar, Bear... LET'S COMBINE!   
   
**Tamamo Cat Woof:**   
Let's go, Master! It's time for some triple cat trouble!   
   
## Interlude : Third Gate  
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Huh? The last gate's supposed to be here...   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
But instead there's this weird field. And what's that funky steel tower...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That rocket...!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Watch out! You'll be ambushed!  
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
...! A ghastly aura!   
   
**X:**   
Heh. Not bad, new Saber! You guys just keep popping up like weeds, don't you?   
   
**X:**   
I've been watching from afar... What's with that cool battle animation!?   
   
**X:**   
A true Saber should only use a single beloved blade! Using two is so wrong... You should be ashamed of yourself!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah. Dual-wielding isn't a Saber style at all.  
   
**X:**   
That is correct. I knew you were the type of Master who would understand, Fujimaru. Hello!   
   
**X:**   
Here's your New Year's present. It's red bean paste balls they sell at a station on planet Guntama.   
   
**X:**   
Anyway, did you hear that, newbie!? Dual-wielding is MY thing, so cut it out!   
   
**X:**   
Even my self-control, which is reinforced as tightly as a plasma chain, is still about to snap!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Musashi, that's a ninja.  
   
**Musashi:**   
Huh? No way! Ninjas don't stand out like that.   
   
**Musashi:**   
And her skill with the sword seems like the real deal. It's a style I've never seen before. I can tell that she's a master swordsman.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Yeah. That girl looks really fun. How do I put it... I've never met anybody so deserving of my blade!   
   
**X:**   
Umm... When you say that with a smile on your face, it's like you're telling me you like me. You're making me blush!   
   
**X:**   
...This is bad... I get the same sense from this Saber as I did from that kimono-clad street murderer!   
   
  
---  
   
**X:**   
Either way, I'm going to attack like I'm the victor of this fight! I am Heroine X, the Space Saber!   
   
**X:**   
I work to maintain the balance of the Servant universe by defeating the ever growing number of Sabers! All things must be perfectly in balance!   
   
**X:**   
Taste my ever-so-flashy Saber Ninja Technique!   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
What...? Saber Ninja Technique, you say!?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I knew you would know about this, Raiden.  
   
  
---  
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Yes, it's a demonic technique some traveler taught to the King of Knights&ndash;after the latter crossed the sea by mistake and got lost on Mt. Katsuragi.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Though extraordinarily powerful, it's a cursed technique that becomes almost useless once its user joins your side.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
I never thought such a technique would ever get implemented... I mean, would actually exist!   
   
**X:**   
Heh. I may not have Nameless Red or Babbagen with me this time, but I do have barbaric techniques that can only be used alone!   
   
**X:**   
Get ready, dual-wielder! And be careful, Fujimaru!   
   
**X:**   
Don't underestimate me just because it's New Year's! I'm kind of seriously strong right now!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fine! Bring it on!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Please go easy since it's New Year's.  
   
  
---  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**X:**   
...! This Saber's a pain!   
   
**X:**   
Just like me, she'll do whatever it takes to win, and it really looks like ANYTHING goes!   
   
**Musashi:**   
No way! Sure, I'll do whatever I need to in order to win, but my policy is to master a single technique!   
   
**Musashi:**   
Niten Ichiryu is an attempt to challenge and overcome an absolute “one”!   
   
**Musashi:**   
I've set my eyes on your weakness! I shall reach the apex of heaven. Now prepare yourself!   
   
**X:**   
...! She's after my left hand...! I know what she's doing, but I don't think I can stop her...!   
   
**X:**   
Tch&mdash;!   
   
**X:**   
Oww! Owwwww! I can't believe she destroyed the W. F. D. bracelet on my wrist!   
   
**X:**   
This was specially made by the new engineer that joined my Knights of the Round Table team, Lionhead!   
   
**X:**   
Very well! We'll finish this later! Actually, I'm running away because I'm scared!   
   
**X:**   
But don't think you've won! A second and third me will appear one of these days! Just wait for it!   
   
**X:**   
Until we meet again, Fujimaru! I'll see you in yet another spacey war someday!   
   
**Musashi:**   
...She also disappeared. Well, that was a strange opponent.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Fujimaru, are all Servants like that?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
X is...special.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Just forget about her.  
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
I see. So she's an exception among exceptions. That explains why we got along so well.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
...Hm. What exactly does that mean?   
   
**Musashi:**   
Neither she nor I are really part of this world. In a sense, we're alike that way.   
   
**Musashi:**   
You know, I'm the kind of girl who randomly wanders into different worlds. I know how it feels to be left out no matter where you are.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
...I knew it.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Anyway, this is the final gate. We're almost to the top. Let's hurry before someone else stops us.   
   
## Drifter  
   
**Musashi:**   
Whoa... So that's what the Incineration of Humanity was...? You battled and went through a lot!   
   
**Musashi:**   
That means you took back our history and future, right? That's amazing. I'm sure everyone praised you for that.   
   
**Musashi:**   
So let me add in as a bonus: Good work, Fujimaru. I'm sure it was a long year for you.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Oh, and another thing, Master of Chaldea... Happy New Year!   
   
**Musashi:**   
Thanks to you, I can continue my journey!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I was helped by so many around me.  
   
**Musashi:**   
Aww, come on! Bonding with others is great and all, but that alone's not enough to do it justice!   
   
**Musashi:**   
In the end, it was all about your potential!   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
...I'm very interested in you as well, Shinmen Musashi. Why have you continued your wandering journeys?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's your goal for your journey?  
   
**Musashi:**   
My journey's goal? Um, that's...   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
Yes. I would like to know as well. Shinmen Musashi, what do you seek?   
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
...Hmm. My journey is just to perfect my skills, so there's no real goal.   
   
**Musashi:**   
I guess if I had a goal, it's to get home to my world. And to master my bladework.   
   
**Musashi:**   
My dad... Munisai's blade was about “one.” A perfected “one.” A “one” that reached heights that could never be exceeded.   
   
**Musashi:**   
But I HAAATE that damn old man. So I want to surpass him no matter what it takes.   
   
**Musashi:**   
So I want a sword that can exceed “one.” Before I die, I want to reach the Throne of the Void. I want to achieve “zero.”   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
...   
   
**Musashi:**   
There it is! I feel it! Fujimaru, there's a hole there!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I can't see it, but I can tell.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
We got here pretty anticlimactically.  
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
...Well, you're right. It's too bad, since we got to know each other so well.   
   
**Musashi:**   
I have my own world, and you have your own world of Chaldea.   
   
**Musashi:**   
It's a shame, but we have to say goodbye. But if we have the chance, I'm sure we'll meet again somewhere&mdash;   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
No, that will never happen. You will die here, Shinmen Musashi.   
   
**Sukeroku:**   
You said you wanted to go home, right? But that was never going to happen in the first place.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He's turning into... a Servant!?  
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
...What? Did you know me, Sukeroku?   
   
**Musashi:**   
Did you follow me around because you hated me for some reason?   
   
**???:**  
...That's right. For a long, long time, I had forgotten. I had forgotten how I became an oni.   
   
**???:**  
On that day, I fought with you.   
   
**???:**  
After I killed those monkey-like brats in the Miyamoto village, I just happened to pass you by on the mountain road.   
   
**???:**  
What a beautiful sight you were, there in the twilight. The very embodiment of evil.   
   
**???:**  
I knew instantly that I had to fight you or I would have regretted it.   
   
**???:**  
That's how beautiful your demeanor was. It was enough to drive me mad, had I let you go.   
   
**???:**  
...And you defeated me. And now I'm finally able to remember your words you uttered at that time.   
   
**???:**  
“If it's for money or honor, I'm going to run. If it's for hate or duty, I'll run then, too.”   
   
**???:**  
“But...if you say your spirit can't survive unless you kill me, then I shall fight you.”   
   
**???:**  
“If our lives cannot exist without killing each other, then I shall resign myself to this bloodshed.”   
   
**Musashi:**   
Yeah, that sounds right. I'll kill someone for that reason.   
   
**???:**  
Indeed. So then you defeated me, and I wandered the world harboring a grudge. The next thing I knew, I had become an oni that had forgotten everything.   
   
**???:**  
But...meeting you brought back my rage. I will repeat what I said then.   
   
**???:**  
“Fight me, flower that blossoms at the apex of heaven. Life is meaningless to me if I don't kill you.”   
   
**Musashi:**   
... (Sigh)   
   
**Musashi:**   
Sorry, Fujimaru, can you help me out?   
   
**Musashi:**   
I don't think I can slay him completely. But with you, I can let him move on to the next life. I know it's a pain, but&mdash;   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
All right. It won't be for your sake...  
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
...Yup. I knew I could count on the one who saved the world. It's impressive at your age.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Very well, you obsessed oni. I don't know who you are.   
   
**Musashi:**   
No, I don't even remember your name. You must be one of the many warriors I slew.   
   
**Musashi:**   
I doubt I will remember this fight, either. But come.   
   
**Musashi:**   
I am Shinmen Musashi-no-Kami Fujiwara-no-Harunobu! Master of the Niten Ichiryu! With my Fifth Force, I shall cut your obsession crosswise!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Musashi:**   
Arima whatchamacallit, your life is mine...!   
   
**Oni:**   
Gwaah... Oooohh...!   
   
**Oni:**   
This inescapable declaration of death&mdash; This is it! This is the flower of the blade I saw on that day...!   
   
**Oni:**   
Haha&mdash; But, how futile.   
   
**Oni:**   
Poor Musashi. How sad, Musashi. The desire to return home&mdash;   
   
**Oni:**   
You cannot return anywhere. You are the same as the Heroic Spirits.   
   
**Oni:**   
I'm sure you've realized it already. Your world disappeared a long time ago.   
   
**Oni:**   
You were ejected from your vanishing world, and you are going up a creek without a paddle through the worlds of others.   
   
**Oni:**   
You'll be an outcast, forever and ever.   
   
**Oni:**   
There is no world left for you to belong to.   
   
**Musashi:**   
...   
   
**Oni:**   
You will never be able to return home, and your journey will continue forever. That is, until the time you meet the greatest foe of your life.   
   
**Oni:**   
Thus, I pity you. For such a master of the arts does not exist.   
   
**Musashi:**   
...Hold it. I hate to criticize someone's dying words, but what are you talking about?   
   
**Musashi:**   
I can encounter all kinds of “greatest foes.” I mean, I was almost killed by a scary old guy just recently.   
   
**Oni:**   
...No. That's not it. That's not it, Musashi.   
   
**Oni:**   
There are no doubt better swordsmen, greater masters than you.   
   
**Oni:**   
But that is not what I mean by your greatest foe.   
   
**Oni:**   
It's the path that you seek. To a swordsman, the greatest foe is one who has mastered the path, the Origin opposite to their own.   
   
**Oni:**   
But...but, that will never be fulfilled. Such a person doesn't even exist.   
   
**Oni:**   
The Swordsman of the Heavenly Eye. That path where zero rivals one is, in other words, infinity.   
   
**Oni:**   
No swordsman has ever reached infinity. Such a path is something no one can ever reach.   
   
**Oni:**   
Thus...your journey will never end. You are just like a drifting boat&mdash;   
   
**Oni:**   
Oh... How I pity you, Musashi. How sad you are, Musashi.   
   
**Oni:**   
All your talent will never pay off. Even with all your training, you will never get a chance to truly use it...   
   
**Oni:**   
Like a flower blooming in the twilight, you will only scatter idly.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Begone to your next life. Someday, I will join you.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Musashi.  
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
All right. Now that the pain in the neck is gone, it really is time to say goodbye.   
   
**Musashi:**   
That oni said I can't go back to my old world, but don't let it bother you too much.   
   
**Musashi:**   
If nothing else, I can go back to the world I was in before I came here. Just like how you'll wake up in Chaldea.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Oh, if you do make it safely back, immortalize me in a journal or something.   
   
**Musashi:**   
Well, we were companions for a while. A really, really short while, though...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I want you to remember, too.  
   
  
---  
   
**Musashi:**   
...Yes, of course! Anyway, goodbye, Master!   
   
**Musashi:**   
...Oh, right! I'm so dumb. How could I just realize this now?   
   
**Musashi:**   
A once-a-year joyous and happy event&mdash; of course it was fun!   
   
**Musashi:**   
This was the first dream you had in the new year!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yeah. See you later, Musashi!  
   
  
---  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou?   
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning, Senpai. Happy New Year.   
   
**Mash:**   
As I promised last night, I am here for your seven o'clock wake-up call!   
   
**Mash:**   
You're going to help Da Vinci with her mochi-making party, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
I can't wait to&mdash;Master?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Um, is something wrong? It looks like you were crying...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I don't know.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...I think I had a strange dream...  
   
  
---  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou?   
   
**Mash:**   
I see. But it wasn't a bad one, was it?   
   
**Mash:**   
How do I know, you ask? I can tell. You look very happy.   
   
**Mash:**   
It was sad, but there was also something good... That's the look you always have when that happens.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou. Fou!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I see. Happy New Year, Mash.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's go see Da Vinci!  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
   
Right! I'll accompany you on our first mission of 2019, Master!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fouuu!
