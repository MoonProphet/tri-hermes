# Trial Quest - Amakusa Shiro  
  
## Chapter I - Sky-Soaring Knight  
   
**Mash:**   
Doctor. These coordinates mark the location where a Singularity is forming, correct?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Yes, enemy readings are exceeding predictions and have been confirmed in several areas.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
If we don't do anything about it, it might exacerbate the separation and collapse of the Seven Eras.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It seems that Servants are being summoned in opposition, so I want you to go and help correct the era.   
   
**Mash:**   
Okay. Well then, Master, let's look for those Servants for the time being.   
   
**Mash:**   
This town is in ruins. There is not a single soul in sight...   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I'm getting readings on a Servant near you. Do you not see it?   
   
**Mash:**   
A...Servant? I can sense its presence, but I cannot see its form&ndash;   
   
**???:**  
Boo!   
   
**Mash:**   
Ahhh!?   
   
**Fou:**   
Foou!?   
   
**???:**  
Hah hah hah! Did I startle you? Did I?   
   
**???:**  
Ah, sorry about that. I just got carried away in the moment!   
   
**Mash:**   
To just suddenly appear like that out of the sky... That made me scream out loud. How unbefitting of a Servant...   
   
**Mash:**   
Uhh, you are a Servant...correct?   
   
**???:**  
Indeed! My name is Astolfo!   
   
**Astolfo:**   
My class is Rider, and I am one of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne!   
   
**Astolfo:**   
My hobbies are walking, eating, jousting, gambling, drinking, reading, chatting, and also...   
   
**Mash:**   
Th-That's enough. My name is Mash Kyrielight.   
   
**Mash:**   
This is Fujimaru, my Master.   
   
**Astolfo:**   
What a cute little Servant... So you're the Master, huh! Nice to meet you!   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Huh? Have we met before?   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Hmm... I forgot, but whatever! So what are you doing here?   
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes. We are investigating a Singularity&ndash;   
   
**Astolfo:**   
A Singularity? I see. I think I've heard of those.   
   
**Astolfo:**   
But I don't really know much myself.   
   
**Mash:**   
I see... In that case, do you know any of the remaining Servants?   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Ah!   
   
**Mash:**   
W-What!?   
   
**Astolfo:**   
That's right! The reason why I called out to you! Now I remember!   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Oh man, I was just about to forget about it, too! Heh heh.   
   
**Mash:**   
Please don't forget...   
   
**Astolfo:**   
There are actually two other Servants here. One of them is a Ruler!   
   
**Mash:**   
A Ruler... A Ruler!? Like Jeanne d'Arc?   
   
**Astolfo:**   
That's right, just like her! The other is an Archer.   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Umm, I can't quite recall the name... Gira...Giri...Gil...   
   
**Mash:**   
...Perhaps “Gilgamesh”?   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Oh yes, that's right! Gilgamesh!   
   
**Mash:**   
The King of Heroes, Gilgamesh... The oldest Heroic Spirit who possesses an inexhaustible amount of treasures.   
   
**Mash:**   
The weapons from his treasury later became prototypes for weapons owned by other heroes in this world.   
   
**Mash:**   
Or that's what Da Vinci said. I've never actually met Gilgamesh, but...   
   
**Mash:**   
Ah, I'm not sure. I have this feeling...that maybe I have met him...   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Surely it was a dream.   
   
**Mash:**   
A dream, huh. I see. Now that you mention it, I think you're right.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I've seen him.   
   
**Mash:**   
Really? Umm... Are you talking about Santa?   
   
**Mash:**   
What are you talking about? I apologize for my ignorance...   
   
---  
   
**Astolfo:**   
Indeed. He did seem like a child worthy of that name.   
   
**Astolfo:**   
I'm sure in the future that child will be a great hero! But he'll also probably turn out to be a tyrant!   
   
**Mash:**   
So, what happened to the two of them?   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Oh, um, you see... How do I explain...   
   
**Astolfo:**   
That Ruler and Archer I met, you see... They're...waging.   
   
**Mash:**   
Waging... What are they waging?   
   
**Astolfo:**   
A Holy Grail War.   
   
**Mash:**   
What... A Holy Grail...   
   
**Mash:**   
Whaaaat!?   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Come, follow me! At any rate, I want you to stop the two of them!   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Come on! Hurry, hurry!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hey! Sorry to ruin the party, but it's time for battle.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Some Lamia-type enemies are heading in your direction.   
   
**Mash:**   
Okay. I have visual confirmation of the enemy. Preparing to engage!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Uh, Astolfo!?   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Ahhhhhh! Snakes, there are snakes!   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Okay! It's hunting time! I'll make sure that at least thirty of them enter Nirvana...or Heaven?   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Anyway, I'll send them packing down the road to the afterlife!   
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
   
**Astolfo:**   
What a big haul! I've got to say, snake hunting is so much fun!   
   
**Astolfo:**   
At this rate, I could go ahead and change the whole ecosystem!   
   
**Mash:**   
Please don't change the ecosystem...   
   
**Mash:**   
Well, I suppose Lamias have no influence over the ecosystem, so it's no problem, but still...   
   
**Mash:**   
A-Anyway, it's more important that we stop the two who initiated a Holy Grail War!   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Oh yes, I forgot! Well then, both of you, just follow me!   
   
## Chapter II - The Child King and The Rebel Saint  
   
**F：???:**  
Hmm... Well, this is pointless. We're completely different when it comes to ideology.   
   
**E：???:**  
&ndash;And neither one of us comes out on top if we fight.   
   
**E：???:**  
You're above me when it comes to being a Heroic Spirit, though&ndash;   
   
**F：???:**  
Since you were summoned as a Ruler class, I'm at a disadvantage.   
   
**F：???:**  
Well, this is a problem. We're at an impasse now.   
   
**F：???:**  
If that Rider would become an ally instead...   
   
**E：???:**  
Unfortunately, that Rider hates us both.   
   
**E：???:**  
Well, no.   
   
**E：???:**  
I don't think you're hated. Just... Maybe the Rider knows how you're going to end up in the future.   
   
**F：???:**  
Ouch, that stings. I personally want to grow up to be a proper person.   
   
**F：???:**  
&ndash;Well, if the Rider turns against me, that's fine. Can't do much about it.   
   
**E：???:**  
As expected from the world-renowned King of Heroes. ...I didn't think you'd be this young.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
I didn't think I'd get summoned like this either.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
If Servants are summoned at their peak condition, I should've shown up in such a form as well, but...   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
It seems this Holy Grail is bugging out. So I would like to ask you to hand it over right away.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
This isn't something that a pretend holy man from the Far East should be playing with, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Hahaha. I can't deny that reputation of mine. But I have a dream of my own.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
“I have spread my dreams under your feet. Tread softly because you stroll on my dreams.”   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
&ndash;So, unfortunately, I can't just do that.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Looks like there's no choice, then. I'm not sure when we'll settle this, but we'll have to fight&ndash;   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Yes. ...Looks like we'll have to get down to it.   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Oh. There they are! I brought a Master here!   
   
**Both:**   
Huh?   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
I see, we can tell Master why we need the Grail and then let Master decide in the end.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
I don't think it's a bad plan. ...What do you think, King of Heroes?   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Hmm... Well, I don't mind. But can you really do this without any grudges?   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
You could say that about anything. Astolfo, what do you think?   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Oh, I don't need the Grail!   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Once summoned, it's the Servant's job to completely be loyal to their Master!   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Ouch, that stings.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
If one's Master is a proper Master, then that makes sense.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Well, that makes it sound like you've served an “improper” Master in the past, now doesn't it?   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
A lot happens when you've been a Servant for a while.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Well, if Astolfo isn't going to participate, then it's just between me and him.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Then, I'll go first.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
It's only natural that I would desire the Holy Grail. It is in a king's nature to wish to amass fortune.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Also, when we're talking about a Holy Grail that will grant every...well, almost every wish, we have to be very careful.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
In that case, it should be a king's duty to store away such an object. It's not like there's anything I would wish at this time, anyway.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
No return here, but no risk involved.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Master, given the situation here, don't you think it would be best to let me handle the Grail?   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
I'm...not so sure about that.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
What Gilgamesh says is true. The Holy Grail is dangerous. However, as a neutral power, it should be used to maximum effect.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...This pseudo Holy Grail isn't enough to fulfill my wish, however.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wish?   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
My wish is everlasting world peace. But with the current state of things, I'm not sure it'll make it that far.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Isn't enough?   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
I'd like to wish for world peace, but unfortunately, this world is about to be incinerated.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Even if the world isn't incinerated, this Holy Grail will never be able to bring about perfect world peace.   
   
---  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...But it'd be an extreme waste just to keep this Holy Grail locked away.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Fortunately, I know how the Holy Grail works. It would be best if you let me handle the Grail.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
What do you think, Master?   
   
**Mash:**   
W-What should we do, Master? They both have good points, but I'm not sure they're correct.   
   
**Mash:**   
I can't decide myself!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Hmm... This is hard.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I have data on the pseudo Holy Grail. It's growing, eating the magic energy around it.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
At this rate, it's going to stop being pseudo. You can't give that to a Servant you haven't contracted with...   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I feel like it'd be dangerous.   
   
**Astolfo:**   
So, it is dangerous then. Yeah, those two treat their Masters rather rudely.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
You can't go saying that, Astolfo. I am very considerate of my Masters.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Even if my Master is a tyrant, and orders me to do the most annoying work,   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
I won't murder them. Nothing so immoral. Isn't that right, Amakusa Shirou?   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Hahaha. You're acting like you want people to think that I killed one of my Masters, I see.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Unfortunately for you, I have not.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
I let one die before, but that was more like an unfortunate accident.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
I do think what I did was wrong. I won't do it again.   
   
**Both:**   
... ...   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Ahem. ...In any event, last Master in this world...   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Who's the most worthy of the Grail?   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Me or him. Who do you pick?   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'll take it.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Yeah... I thought that might happen.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
The second Astolfo brought you here, I thought that things might turn out this way.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Either is bad.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
That's just the way it goes. This is a Holy Grail War after all.   
   
---  
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
In that case... There's only one thing left to do.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Yes, we'll work together and... ...keep Master away.   
   
**Mash:**   
What? That's how this is going to turn out?   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Of course! This is a Holy Grail War, after all!   
   
**Astolfo:**   
In that case, I'm on Master's side! We'll just have to see who wins...   
   
**Astolfo:**   
...That which rules, that which serves, or that which rebels.   
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Ow... Not very adult of you to do that to a kid.   
   
**Astolfo:**   
You're not really a kid!   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Not very adult of you to do that to a clergyman...   
   
**Astolfo:**   
You, part of the clergy?! In any event, the Grail goes to my Master!   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Huh?   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...This is not good. Looks like we took too much time.   
   
**Mash:**   
Time? What's going...   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Fujimaru, this is bad!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
It looks like the pseudo Holy Grail just summoned Shadow Servants!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Too many variables. Approach with caution!   
   
## Chapter III - False Grail, Untouched by Heaven  
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Oh, well. I guess that's it for that Holy Grail.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
It was fake to begin with, so maybe it was easy to infect. Should have stored it immediately.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Should have put it under our control immediately. We should both think about what we did.   
   
**Astolfo:**   
And you two still won't admit you should have given it up. That's so typical of you two!   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Umm... Fujimaru? We'd like to help, too.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
I mean, no matter how you think about it, our fight was the cause of all of this.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
We need to take responsibility.   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thanks.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Got it. I'll be helping out then!   
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Sure, thanks.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Understood. Then the two of us will back you up.   
   
---  
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Looks like it's been completely infected. Destroying it immediately will prevent any more issues, I imagine.   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I've already confirmed several Shadow Servants. It's possible it will become a Singularity if we leave it like this.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
I agree.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
It won't nearly be on the same level as the Greater Grail at Fuyuki, but it would be terrible if it was even a fraction of that.   
   
**Mash:**   
You know about the Greater Grail at Fuyuki?   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Yes. The one in a faraway, unrelated world, right? ...Well, that aside...   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
We'll have one of us guard Fujimaru. The other two will intercept the enemy. How does that sound?   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
We'll take out the Shadow Servants first. After that we can destroy the Holy Grail.   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Okay, leave it to me! In that case, Kid Gil and I will head to attack.   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Master, you work with Ruler, over there.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Okay, thank you&ndash; It's been a while since I fought alongside someone.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Unfortunately, I'm from a rather hard-to-control class, but&ndash; Please put me to good use.   
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
I've wiped out most of them, but&ndash;   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Help&mdash;!   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...Astolfo?   
   
**Astolfo:**   
I am really afraid of ghosts! I am sorry, but please help meeeeeeee!   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...Oh, brother...   
   
**--ARROW--:**  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Ghosts? Then our only option is to exorcise them.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
All I can offer is a pseudo baptism rite. But it's better than letting them continue to exist in that anguished state.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
&ndash;Well then, let's get going, shall we, Master?   
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
With this, we've finished clearing out all the Shadow Servants as well&ndash;   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Now the problem is how to destroy this Holy Grail. Gil, do you have anything for that?   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Hmm... For something like that, a sword from my treasury might do it.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
&ndash;Though the real problem is figuring out what this fake Grail is trying to give birth to.   
   
**Mash:**   
W-What? It's trying to...give birth?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Whoa, whoa, whoa... Huge amounts of magical energy are pouring out of that Grail! Something's coming out of it!   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
Huh? You're wondering what that something is?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
I don't think it's a Demon God Pillar, but... I think it's probably something fairly equal in power to it?   
   
**Dr. Roman:**   
...This is a disaster!!   
   
**--ARROW--:**  
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Now then, we'll keep back this massive ghost&ndash;   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
I'll summon swords as needed from my Gate of Babylon and destroy it.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
So cover me out there. Also, please keep out of my line of fire, okay?   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Especially you, Rider.   
   
**Astolfo:**   
I-I've got it, all right?! Don't worry! I absolutely won't enter your line of fire!   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Because I have no doubt that you'd destroy me along with the target! That's what my gut's telling me!   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
You're absolutely correct!   
   
**Astolfo:**   
I'd expect nothing less from a future tyrant-king! But whatever. Okay...let's go, Hipp!   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Well then, I'll also be heading out to keep that creature at bay.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
...Master, stay between us. You can pick one of us to follow and back up.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
I'll be off, then. &ndash;Set!   
   
**Mash:**   
Master, give me your orders! I will destroy that false Holy Grail!   
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
   
**Mash:**   
W-We beat it somehow... The massive ghost is breaking apart!   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Okay, that's my cue! Now&mdash; Shatter!   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Well, that's that. It's over. That didn't measure up to Heaven's Feel at all.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Being shattered is perhaps the most fitting end for it.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Hah, I didn't really want to own it, but just letting it break feels like a waste... Actually, no, it doesn't.   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
After all, it was like wings made of wax. Inferior even to the black wings of a real crow.   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Well, I guess that concludes this little pseudo Holy Grail War. And here I thought I'd finally get my chance to punch Amakusa Shirou!   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Well, you were close, anyway. But how lucky it was for us to run into a real Master in a place like this.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
If, someday, we are able to form a real contract between us, I hope I will be able to serve you well.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
I will gladly work with you to grant my own dream as well.   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Though, in my opinion, it's a pretty worthless dream!   
   
**Astolfo:**   
But, whatever.   
   
**Astolfo:**   
Well, if it is in our fates to meet again, good tidings to you from Astolfo of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne!   
   
**Astolfo:**   
If you'll kindly summon me, I'll give you a good, thumping shoulder rub! See you!   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Well... I'd like to be summoned back again too, but I suppose this isn't really my prime form, huh?   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
But I think, maybe, I could be more helpful than my adult form would be?   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Yes. I'd really like it if, next time, you could judge which of us is the better Servant, Master!   
   
**Gilgamesh (Child):**  
Well, I hope it is in our fates to meet again! Goodbye, Master.

**Amakusa Shirou:**   
Master Fujimaru. My True Name is Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.   
   
**Amakusa Shirou:**   
As a mediator and as a Servant, I will gladly fight by your side!
