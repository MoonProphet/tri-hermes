# Trial Quest - Scatatch  
  
## Master of the Ghost Cave  
   
**Mash:**   
...Sen...pai?   
   
**Mash:**   
This... Looks like Fuyuki city... But I don't remember Rayshifting...   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm having trouble remembering much of anything. I took some medicine and laid down...   
   
**Mash:**   
But now I'm in this form... I'm armed as a Demi-Servant.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fofooou!   
   
**Mash:**   
Fou!? When did you get into the carrying space in my shield?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, kyaau?   
   
**Mash:**   
...I can't contact Chaldea's control room. So the doctor can't analyze our situation or bring us back.   
   
**Mash:**   
One possibility is... That this is a type of shared memory between the Servant and the Master... A type of dream.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Those flames are awfully hot for a dream.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai. I can feel the heat as if it's real.   
   
**Mash:**   
This is the same Fuyuki city we traveled to with the director. But whether it's the same era, or if we're dreaming...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
There's so much fire but I don't feel the heat.  
   
**Mash:**   
...? You don't feel the heat? Maybe it's because I'm a Demi-Servant...   
   
**Mash:**   
I may be different than you. ...That makes me a little sad.   
   
  
---  
   
**???:**  
&mdash;I see. So this is how you "perceive" this place.   
   
**???:**  
I know your names already. Fujimaru, and the girl is Mash Kyrielight.   
   
**???:**  
You are inside a dream, sharing a memory of an intense experience you both had.   
   
**???:**  
Perhaps I should say this is how the "system" works. Still, this is quite an interesting phenomenon.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Who are you?   
   
**Mash:**   
Your magical energy... It does feel like a Servant's, but...   
   
**Mash:**   
...Something seems very different somehow...   
   
**Mash:**   
You're not one of the Servants we saw in Fuyuki... Not only that, but I don't think   
   
**Mash:**   
we've ever met you before. I don't...think so, anyway. My memory's hazy...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I don't remember you.  
   
**???:**  
Hmm. Of course not.   
   
**???:**  
It's been 2,000 years since I've shown myself to anyone. We couldn't have met.   
   
**???:**  
...If you said you had seen me, then we'd have a bit of a problem.   
   
**???:**  
You're not an escapee from my realm, are you? You're not a ghost either, correct?   
   
**Mash:**   
...We're not ghost-type monsters, no. But, you said 2,000 years, right?   
   
**Mash:**   
That would be around the birth of Christ... Do you mean that's when you were alive?   
   
**???:**  
...Hmm. So drawing a clear line to explain my existence, huh?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
 I've seen that spear...  
   
**???:**  
Hmm, I feel a passionate gaze upon me.   
   
**???:**  
Oh, it's not me, but my spear you're looking at? It's good that you can assess weapons at your age.   
   
**???:**  
But this isn't what you are expecting. It's not a Divine Construct, forged by The Sea God, Manannan.   
   
**???:**  
Sadly, it's just a spear. A stick, made from the skeleton of a sea creature.   
   
**???:**  
...Or perhaps you were pretending to look at the spear, but were actually looking at me?   
   
**???:**  
Heheh. You've never met an Ulster woman, have you?   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, I know how you feel, but please restrain yourself for now.   
   
**Mash:**   
It's true that her proportions are... just about perfect, but...   
   
**Fou:**   
Foou!   
   
  
---  
   
**???:**  
Hmm. How should I put this? Thinking back, I haven't given many people my name.   
   
**???:**  
The warriors knew my name when they visited my home. The beasts and fallen gods challenged me out of fear.   
   
**???:**  
They all feared me because they knew who I was.   
   
**???:**  
It's been a long time since you&mdash;no, people like you have asked me what my name is without prejudice.   
   
**???:**  
And so I have no choice but to answer honestly.   
   
**???:**  
I am a being which exists outside the world.   
   
**???:**  
Something which was to exist forever, without getting old or dying.   
   
**???:**  
My name is Scáthach, the ruler of Dún Scáith, the Land of Shadows. Although it does make me a little uncomfortable announcing it like that.   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Fou:**   
Kya&mdash;u!?   
   
**Mash:**   
Scáthach! The god-killing superhuman who's said to practically be a divinity herself?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Is she amazing?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I see. Scáthach, huh...  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai! She's mentioned in the Celtic myths of the first century, particularly the Ulster Cycle!   
   
**Mash:**   
An invincible warrior, the ruler of a supernatural realm similar to the underworld. She even trained the great hero Cú Chulainn!   
   
**Mash:**   
And she's also a "great magus," one of the best ever... But she shouldn't "exist in the Throne of Heroes," so why!?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Doesn't exist in the Throne of Heroes?  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You mean she can't be a Servant?  
   
  
---  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Oh, so the girl knew? You're correct, points for you. Hmm...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
You did talk a little too fast, three stars!   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? Oh, right. Thank you very much.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
It's all right. In your case, it's more effective to speak quietly. Keep it all within you, and be like a silent burning flame.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Sorry, that's an old habit of mine. We don't have time for long chats.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
As Mash said, I was never meant to be here. Since I retired from the battlefields.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I won't get into too much of why I've been summoned, but&ndash;   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I've shown myself for a good reason. To solve the problem occurring within this dream.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Master of Chaldea and you, new Servant, calm yourselves and open your eyes.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Witness what was brought forth by all the abnormality. Something is out of the ordinary here.   
   
**???:**  
AAAAAA...   
   
**???:**  
AAAAAAAA!   
   
**Mash:**   
I saw them as soon as I sensed their magical energy! Enemy approaching, Senpai!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
If they're attacking we have to fight them.  
  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Stay calm and be careful.  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Right! Beginning combat!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Now this is worth traveling through the eras. An impressive response, and pleasantly high morale.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm... I had decided myself to an easy retirement, but seeing you has made me change my mind.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Here we go...   
   
**Mash:**   
Wah!? Scáthach!?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yes, I'll be playing too, Mash. Fujimaru! Save me a seat!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
It's time for battle! First, fight. Fight before you think. Worrying comes after, as a privilege of the living.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
So fight, fight, fight, and win! That's the Celtic way!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Celts are crazy...  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right... It's like violence is a necessity for them...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
YEAH!  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai!?   
   
  
---  
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Now that was an easy fight, I couldn't even remember what they looked like. I guess they weren't that tough, huh?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Now, tell me, Fujimaru. What did those enemies look like to you?   
   
**Mash:**   
We've fought them several times before... Did they look different to you, Scáthach?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
They looked like a smoky haze. To me, they seemed to barely exist.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
And that's because, not once have I perceived the idea of death.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fo-fou, fou?   
   
**Mash:**   
Death?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Indeed. What you're seeing isn't memories of your past...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Nor some kind of symbolism from your dreams.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Those are remnants left behind of a miserable death. They should not exist within you at all.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
To be more precise, they are the "remnants left behind even by death."   
   
**Scáthach:**   
These flames you see. The ones you fought.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
They are the remnants left behind by the death you witnessed as you fought to protect humanity.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
There were many others around. Ten thousand or so moving corpses and skeletons.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
But I took care of all of them. They weren't worth teaching anything. They were far too weak.   
   
**Mash:**   
T-Ten thousand?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hahaha, I'm pleased that you're surprised, but you could've just laughed it off, Mash.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
To a Celtic warrior, numbers mean nothing.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
We're all idiots who fight until we're dead, or there's no one left to fight!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...You mean death is attacking us?  
   
**Scáthach:**   
No, no, that's not it. That's not it at all.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't understand.  
   
**Scáthach:**   
That's fine. That's how you should be. You probably haven't grasp the concept of death yet.   
   
  
---  
   
**Scáthach:**   
"This place" is overflowing with remnants "abandoned" by death.   
   
**Mash:**   
This is a dream I'm sharing with Senpai, right? So why would it be filled with something like that?   
   
**Mash:**   
I don't think the Heroic Spirit I got my power from had the attribute to interfere with death...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I'm sure. A Heroic Spirit who brings death wouldn't suit you at all. This phenomenon is taking place inside you...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...But the causal factor is outside. It's a touch unfair, but, it can't be helped.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
That's what it means for all of human history to be incinerated.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
A normal extinction would cause death to overflow. Purgatory, underworld, anywhere souls can go would be overflowing.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
But this is different. Incineration of Humanity is a "great deed" that doesn't just burn away life, but death itself.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou... Fooooouuu...   
   
**Mash:**   
A great deed...that burns away death?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yes. Miracles that humans use are things like magecraft, rituals, sacraments, and curses.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
And then there are the "Authorities" the gods are said to possess. But the Incineration of Humanity doesn't belong to any of those.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Thus, it is a great deed. A human "feat" which surpasses even the "gods."   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Though not even I am certain what that truly is.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
And so what you're seeing here are the remnants abandoned by death, the direct result after many eras being incinerated.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Then, some of them leaked into this place.   
   
**Mash:**   
You don't... You don't mean inside Chaldea?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
That's correct, in a sense, but also not. Those remnants exist even closer than you imagined.   
   
**Mash:**   
What do you mean?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Here. Put your hands up here.   
   
**Mash:**   
...My chest?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Indeed. But not those marshmallows. It's the warm "heart" that's pulsing inside of you with life.   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Mash:**   
D-Do you mean... Those remnants have already been corrupting us!?   
   
**Mash:**   
That's... What you mean, right? That's why I'm suddenly with Senpai in these flames...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's okay. I don't think you have to worry.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It'll be fine. Let's go back to Chaldea together.  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, Senpai. You're right.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hehe. I thought you'd get scared, but you're holding on to hope. I can't believe how pure you are, but those purest are often the strongest.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Fujimaru's optimism and Mash's pessimism. I find both equally worthy.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Even after two thousand years, you humans haven't changed a bit. So fragile and ephemeral, but noble and beautiful.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
&mdash;It's time to go. Follow me.   
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right. ...No, wait. Where are we going?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
To destroy all the remnants that threatens to overwhelm you.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
As my Land of Shadows no longer exists, normally I wouldn't waste time on ghosts abandoned even by the wheel of reincarnation.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
But I do not think I can just let these things overflow.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...I know how frustrating it is to want to die, and not be able to.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
If the gods will not save them, I will. If they want a fight, I have no reason to refuse.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So this is the Celtic way!  
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yes, Senpai... This violent but dependable power is the Celtic way...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
YEAH!  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai! Is the Celtic way getting to you?   
   
  
---  
   
## Spiral Rainbow  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...That sure is an awful lot of fire, huh?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I already know your names, Fujimaru, Mash. However...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...That doesn't mean I know everything about you. Nor the reason this city is on flames.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
What happened here? This is a place where you once walked, yes?   
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. Fuyuki City, in the far east. That first place we shifted to where a Holy Grail War was taking place.   
   
**Mash:**   
The year was AD 2004. 13 years ago. It's very close to the present, but it's still part of the past.   
   
**Mash:**   
This is where we...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Got caught up in a Holy Grail War that shouldn't exist.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai. We fought many Heroic Spirit for the fragment of the Grail.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Got saved by that Caster guy.  
   
**Mash:**   
...That's right, Senpai. Without him, we would've died.   
   
  
---  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, kyau!   
   
**Mash:**   
That's right, Fou. He's the one who taught me how to pseudo-deploy the Noble Phantasm that was too much for me.   
   
**Mash:**   
Caster Cú Chulainn. I couldn't possibly thank him enough.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Oh?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Oh. I see, I see. "That's why" it's me, huh? You knew him.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Mash, Fujimaru. I'm sorry, can I ask a question?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Was he doing well "at this place?"   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh... Yes! He was doing very well. That's right! You're...   
   
**Mash:**   
Scáthach, a warrior, a mentor to many heroes. You're the woman who trained Cú Chulainn!   
   
**Mash:**   
I-I'm sorry. I knew that in my head, but it's so hard for me to remember that the Caster who saved us...   
   
**Mash:**   
...is the same Cú Chulainn who's part of the Ulster Cycle, and s-so...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Mash, calm down!  
   
**Mash:**   
R-R-R-R-Right, Senpai!   
   
**Fou:**   
Foufou.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
YEAH!  
   
**Mash:**   
YEAH! ...Huh?   
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
I-I'm sorry. I should've realized sooner... He saved our lives.   
   
**Mash:**   
I don't know what to say... Um... Y-Your student really helped us out.   
   
**Mash:**   
We're alive today thanks to the spell he wielded when he materialized as a Druid.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I see. No, there's no need to thank me.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
But nonetheless, as someone deeply related to him, I shall remember that. And someday, I will tell him.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
If I ever get the chance, that is. For now, you must first survive this place.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Otherwise, I'll have to tell him that I saw the children he saved...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...as they died. Now, survive! You must be strong!   
   
**???:**  
GAAAAAA!   
   
**Mash:**   
That roar!?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sounds pretty big.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A... Dragon?  
   
  
---  
   
**Scáthach:**   
That is another remnant of death you witnessed... Or perhaps, will witness in the future.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Time means very little in this place. Just like the Throne of Heroes.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Either way, it's something that's been left behind. Now, overcome this trial, young ones!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foou! Kyau!   
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right... You're right, Fou. I think that might be...   
   
**Mash:**   
That might be a little too big! S-Senpai!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Scáthach!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Can you do something about that?  
   
  
---  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...I guess it would be cruel to make you do everything on your own. Come forth from my "Gate," ye Spiral Rainbow.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
With the divine lightning in your hand, come forth, come forth and fight! Oh Guardian of Ulster.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
My body feels numb.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
My head feels numb.  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai's magical circuits are being activated in a strange way! Scáthach, what are you doing?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm... So that's how young kids are inside these days... Mages' bodies certainly have changed...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
This innocent response is truly&mdash; Oh, no. Never mind. It's a temporary contract.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I'll lend you a new power. Come forth, come forth and fight, Spiral Rainbow Sword!   
   
**Fergus:**   
Hahahaha! Finally it's time, huh? I'm so glad it happened before I got bored and went to sleep!   
   
**Fergus:**   
The young leader of the Ulster Red Branch Knights! Fergus mac Róich, at your service!   
   
**Fergus:**   
I've been waiting for this for a while now, Ms. Scáthach! Hahahahahaha! Damn, it sure is hot in here!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Stop calling me that. When you say it, it makes me feel like a real elder.   
   
**Fergus:**   
Oh, yes. Right, right. Sorry. You're always young, Lady Scáthach.   
   
**Fergus:**   
Your heart is young, as are your skills! As sharp as when you were in your teens! But that's a different matter!   
   
**Fergus:**   
I can't call the mentor I respect a little girl! That's not the Red Branch way! Sorry, Ms. Scáthach!   
   
**Mash:**   
A very boisterous looking man has appeared! Senpai, the Celtic-ness of this place is going up quickly!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're... Uncle Fergus!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
YEAH!  
   
  
---  
   
**Fergus:**   
Indeed! Heh, we've got some spirited new kids, huh?   
   
**Fergus:**   
I guess you're Ms. Scáthach's latest students. Let's see. A pretty looking girl and a [♂ boy /♀ girl]... She put her hands on you yet?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I don't go after everything that moves, like you. I invite only the finest warriors to my bedchamber.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
They are the source of this dream. And hopefully, the ones who can someday lead us.   
   
**Fergus:**   
I see! Oh dear, I'm sorry. Hahaha! Then let's start with a drink! Have a drink with me!   
   
**Fergus:**   
Or let's do something else! If you need a drinking buddy though, I'm your guy!   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, uh. Huh! N-no, I'm sorry, I&mdash;   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh? Senpai too?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So that's it, huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
  
   
  
---  
   
**???:**  
GAAAA!   
   
**Fergus:**   
Hey, it was hot a moment ago, but now it's even hotter! Also I see something big, and worth punching! Even better!   
   
**Fergus:**   
So that's what I'm here for, eh? You need the greatest swordsman the Ulster has!   
   
**Fergus:**   
Time for me to show off my blade! Ms. Scáthach, let me handle this!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Sword... What sword?  
   
**Fergus:**   
Hahaha! What, you don't know my Noble Phantasm?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That drill can't be... It can't be...  
   
**Fergus:**   
Hahaha! So you know my Noble Phantasm, huh?   
   
  
---  
   
**Fergus:**   
Then behold my Rainbow Sword! Caladbolg, the sword that's both rainbows and lightning!   
   
**Fergus:**   
If Cú Chulainn of the Red Branch Knights stabs his foes, then I, Fergus, tear them to shreds!   
   
**Mash:**   
The mystic sword Caladbolg! A legendary sword, said to be the model of many other mystic and holy swords!   
   
**Fergus:**   
Heaven and Earth, spin, spin, spin! Watch in awe as I wield my immense strength!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Fergus:**   
Hmm... It looked like a famous dragon, but it didn't feel that strong.   
   
**Fergus:**   
Next time, I hope to fight one with the proper mind, body and skill!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
That's right, but do not let your guard down. Always face an enemy, even a weak one, with your full strength.   
   
**Fergus:**   
Hmm... Of course, I did not hold back. But are you telling me to fight until my flesh tears and bone breaks?   
   
**Fergus:**   
Hahaha! As expected of Ms. Scáthach! Just how strict can you get?   
   
**Mash:**   
One of the heroes depicted in the Ulster Cycle, a great warrior of the Red Branch Knights, Fergus mac Róich...   
   
**Mash:**   
Um, Fergus. You're another one of Cú Chulainn's teachers, right?   
   
**Fou:**   
Foufou.   
   
**Fergus:**   
Hmm? You mean Sétanta? I did teach him to use a sword, but...   
   
**Fergus:**   
Unfortunately, he wasn't much of a swordsman. He quickly switched to the spear.   
   
**Fergus:**   
I trained with him and also looked after him. You can say he's almost like my own child.   
   
**Fergus:**   
So, do you know him?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Right, it seems they fought together. In this ruined city ravaged by flames called Fuyuki.   
   
**Fergus:**   
Sounds like the Norse Ragnarok. That must be so much fun. I'm jealous.   
   
**Fergus:**   
One of his natural talents is having the luck to be blessed with the most terrifying battles.   
   
**Fergus:**   
If I was there, I could've challenged him to see who was the better warrior. What a shame.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He was a druid.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He was an amazing mage.  
   
  
---  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Oh right, now I remember. They say he was dressed as a druid.   
   
**Fergus:**   
...WHAT!? Was he being bullied?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hahaha! Yes, that's the reaction I was looking for. Nothing really gets funnier than this.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foufoou, kyuu?   
   
**Mash:**   
Um, thank you, Fergus. You helped us even though we summoned you without warning...   
   
**Fergus:**   
Don't worry about it. This was just a temporary contract. Plus, I couldn't refuse Ms. Scáthach's summon.   
   
**Fergus:**   
By the way, what kind of sorcery did you use, Ms. Scáthach? How was I summoned during my mealtime?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It is strange, yeah.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't think a Holy Grail or its fragment is here, right?  
   
  
---  
   
**Scáthach:**   
You're right, a Holy Grail is not present. I tampered around with my Primordial Runes.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I used myself as a catalyst, and stocked Heroic Spirits that I have relations to in this place.   
   
**Mash:**   
Primordial... Runes?   
   
**Fou:**   
Foou! Kyaau!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yes. A true "Primordial Rune." A type of Magical Crest lost in your modern era.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Modern mages have no way of knowing this, but the runes carved by the Great God of the Norse still exist in this world.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
The old runes made after that, and their modern recreations are not even close in comparison.   
   
**Fergus:**   
I see, but I don't get it at all. Ms. Scáthach sure knows a lot! I wish one of us in Red Branch has even a fraction of that intellect.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ancient magecraft can do that?  
   
**Mash:**   
It's more than ancient, you can say it's from the Age of Gods.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's amazing... Actually, it's really, really, amazing!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I guess that's Scáthach for you.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yeah... She's using a rune from the Age of Gods, made by an actual god!   
   
**Mash:**   
It's unimaginable to us. If the Doctor was here he'd be going crazy.   
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
But this explains something I'd been wondering about, Scáthach.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm. And what's that?   
   
**Mash:**   
I finally understand why Cú Chulainn was using runes. He learned how to use them from you.   
   
**Mash:**   
A Primordial Rune. An ultimate spell brought forth by the Great God of the Norse.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Oh, I know that look on your face, Mash Kyrielight. You were wondering why he didn't use Ulster spells, right?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Ogham letters don't work well. Runes take effect as soon as they're drawn, which makes them better for a warrior. That's all.   
   
**Mash:**   
I-I see... I understand that the letters of the Celtic God Ogham...   
   
**Mash:**   
...are hard to use unless you're a true druid. Your power isn't affected by its origin, is it?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
It's a matter of effectiveness. The Great God of the Norse is very kind to warriors.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Now, on to the next location. Are you ready to face the next remnant?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I am ready anytime.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai. I don't know how this happened, but I think I have an idea what we should do.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
YEAH!  
   
**Mash:**   
...Senpai, that was a very powerful response.   
   
**Mash:**   
Are you trying to be a Celt? Are you?   
   
  
---  
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foufoou! Kyaau!   
   
## Coming from Ashes  
   
**Fergus:**   
Sigh... Talk about a disappointment.   
   
**Fergus:**   
If this isn't a letdown, then what is? Yes, this is the prime place for a battle, yet still!   
   
**Fergus:**   
I'd also love to go find a nice lady, but with things in this state there aren't any around! No men, either.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hah, lust is what makes a hero but you, you are on a completely different level.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Those bestial urges of yours might be the source of the power that makes you a hero.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Mash, did you know? This guy...   
   
**Mash:**   
H-Huh? What? Why are you involving me in this conversation, Scáthach?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
His lust is so strong that no human woman can be his wife.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
They all gave up after a few days, and in the end he married a forest goddess.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
That's right, a Divine Spirit. Gods' appearances were rare to begin with in the Ulster Cycle...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...and one of those very rare appearances was made by his wife. He was too much to handle a goddess had to show up.   
   
**Mash:**   
Y-Yeah... Um...   
   
**Mash:**   
I don't...know...what to say... Um... S-Senpai...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's amazing, Fergus.  
   
**Fergus:**   
Hahaha! You've got that right, if I do say so myself!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't know what to do either!  
   
**Fou:**   
Foufou. Fou.   
   
  
---  
   
**Fergus:**   
Whew...  At this point I'll just have to risk my life and ask Ms. Scáthach.   
   
**Mash:**   
Huh?   
   
**Fergus:**   
To tell you the truth, Mash, Fujimaru, I thought about asking you two...   
   
**Fergus:**   
...but you're being guided by the Ms. Scáthach right now. You're basically kids, in a sense.   
   
**Fergus:**   
I can't be going after kids. Which means, well, I've got just one option. No, it's not one I was avoiding.   
   
**Fergus:**   
As an Ulster man, it's my destiny to someday make the Lady of Shadows my own...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I'm ready whenever.   
   
**Fergus:**   
Oooh! How lucky am I!?   
   
**Fou:**   
Foufoufou!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
If you want to receive a blow from my spear that can kill a god, then feel free. Come closer. Don't worry, I will treat you well.   
   
**Fergus:**   
Oh... Um... So... Well...   
   
**Fergus:**   
I-I guess there's no hurry on that one. First, we've gotta get these kids to safety!   
   
**Fergus:**   
And when that's done! I'll take you up on your offer!   
   
**Fergus:**   
First, we fight! If I win, of course, you keep your promise. But if I lose, we'll talk then!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're so bold, Fergus!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
YEAH!  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
R-Right, Senpai. I think he's 100% serious. I don't know whether to be amazed or frightened...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hehe. Dauntlessness, desire, vigor and lack of avarice. A hero must have all these things.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
They are what makes a hero an object of admiration. They are a symbol of glory and victory.   
   
**Mash:**   
That's what makes a hero?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Mash Kyrielight, don't look so confused. There's no need to force yourselves to mimic him.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
It is a virtue to reflect on oneself in the presence of the strong. There, there.   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh... You're patting my head... R-Right...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yes. Now it's your turn, Fujimaru.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Get your head patted.)  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Yes, good child. There, there.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Dodge her head pats.)  
   
**Scáthach:**   
...What? Why are you so embarrassed?   
   
  
---  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Men can only become what they become. You cannot be anyone but yourself. Ever.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...Now, that's enough talking.   
   
**???:**  
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!! [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!!   
   
**Mash:**   
T-This is an incredible amount of magical energy! It's absorbing all the mana in the surrounding area automatically?   
   
**Mash:**   
It's clearly viewing us as enemies! It's looking at us...   
   
**???:**  
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!! [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!!   
   
**Mash:**   
This... This can't be...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Calm down, Mash.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
It's not that different from the others.  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Right, Senpai. I was panicking for a second. Now I'm okay. I can fight!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Oh, I see. So that's your response? Do you fear it so much, Mash?   
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. It scares me a lot.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sure I'm scared of any fighting... But I'll fight anyway. Because I need to.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Humph. Even if someday, the fight may take your life?   
   
**Mash:**   
Of course. My fear and my life are two different things.   
   
**Mash:**   
And... I know something even scarier.   
   
**Mash:**   
I already know how sad it is to do nothing, &mdash;the desolation of leaving nothing behind.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...I see. So you've already reached the deepest truth of life.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Then I've nothing more to say.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
If you die here, you'll be ripped apart from the inside, and Chaldea will be filled with the remnants of death.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Humanity, civilization, everything you've done, everything that exists will lose their last hope forever.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I know.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I figured that was the case.  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Right, Senpai. I feel the same way!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, faau! Kyau!   
   
**Fergus:**   
Excellent! Glad to see you're ready to fight! Let's tear this thing apart then!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Mash:**   
We defeated it! Good work, Senpai.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fou! Kyau, kyauu!   
   
**Fergus:**   
It wasn't a dragon, or a boar, or a giant snake... Humph. I've never seen a monster pillar like that.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
It was beautiful in its own otherworldly way. It would serve as a support pillar for my castle in the Land of Shadows.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
But it's not something that should be praised too much. Besides, that's a really twisted way of naming something.   
   
**Mash:**   
Scáthach, perhaps you already knew what that thing really was?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Once you become part of the shadow and abyss you can see the future to a certain degree, But no, I didn't know about it beforehand...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I simply saw a fragment of the future related to it. The Incineration of Humanity.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I'm not that different than you. Though...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I can see things like...this!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...You dodged it, huh? I see why they call you the Great King of Destruction.   
   
**Altera:**   
...That was what I was going to say. What is that spear made of that my blade cannot destroy?   
   
**Altera:**   
I am a destroyer. Of both old and new civilization.   
   
**Altera:**   
I will remove all traces of sentient beings from this planet. I will destroy all that stand in my way.   
   
**Mash:**   
...You're!?   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou! Kyuu, kyaau!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Is this another remnant of death?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
This is quite the creature we've run into. Is the incineration of humanity capable of twisting things this far?   
   
**Mash:**   
You know who she is, don't you? This Heroic spirit, whose magical energy rivals a dragon...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
More than you do. As the slayer of many gods, and bearer of the knowledge of the Land of Shadows...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...and as a being who's achieved eternity on the outside of the world, I know one thing...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
This would-be war machine is a little too dangerous to appear as a remnant of death!   
   
**Fergus:**   
That's right. Indeed, Ms. Scáthach is just right! But, I do like slender bodies, though...   
   
**Fergus:**   
I can feel the core of my groin tighten when I look at her! She might be even a better woman than Ms. Scáthach!   
   
**Fergus:**   
Hahaha, but my intuition says what's inside her ain't quite what it looks like!   
   
**Fergus:**   
Go on ahead, Fujimaru, Mash!   
   
**Fergus:**   
My Caladbolg is enough to delay the incarnated form of the King of Destruction!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Fergus!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
YEAH!  
   
  
---  
   
**Fergus:**   
Don't worry. It's a question of compatibility.   
   
**Fergus:**   
My guess is that if I break her first, she won't be able to use her full power!   
   
**Fergus:**   
Ms. Scáthach has the job of guiding you! So go!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Sorry, Fergus. I'll leave the rest to you.   
   
**Fergus:**   
It's an honor! Until we meet again, friends! Now that fate's brought us together, I'm sure we will!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Right!   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foouuu!   
   
**Fergus:**   
Good, they're gone. ...Well, next time we meet, they might be enemies.   
   
**Fergus:**   
I'm always on the side with the best girls, so I can't guarantee anything there.   
   
**Altera:**   
...   
   
**Fergus:**   
Now, let's do this. Let's fight fair, square, and hard, so we've got no regrets.   
   
**Fergus:**   
For as stubborn as you are, though, you're awfully polite. I can't believe you let Fujimaru go.   
   
**Altera:**   
It's all the same. After I crush you, I'll destroy them too.   
   
**Altera:**   
I destroy all that I see. That's what I was made for.   
   
**Fergus:**   
You know, it'll be a hassle to break your body in that state.   
   
**Fergus:**   
But you know! I'm ready for it!   
   
**Fergus:**   
Whether it's coincidence, or inevitability I have no idea. It's probably a curse of the ancient gods...   
   
**Fergus:**   
But the true identity of my spiral sword, being a fragment of the distant, ancient gods is more than enough reason to kill you!   
   
**Altera:**   
...Target, one. Initiate destruction.   
   
## Final Guidance  
   
**Mash:**   
...Is Fergus okay, you think?   
   
**Mash:**   
I can't detect his magical energy, maybe because of the fire. His temporary contract with Senpai appears to be broken.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foouu... Fouu...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Uncle...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Fergus...  
   
  
---  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Don't make that face, Fujimaru. Celtic warriors live to challenge the powerful.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
And you're still alive. Whether he died or not, he achieved his goal.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
The most you can do is laugh. He'd say he didn't need anything, but if you want to give him something, that's enough.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Right.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Did you not hear me? ...Hmm. Maybe you didn't.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Still, this town's flame sure is burning bright. Also, it seems we've been running around in circles.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Why are we back here?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...I think I understand.  
   
  
---  
   
**Scáthach:**   
A town about to burn to the ground, huh? This place must have left strong impressions of death on you.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
That's why there are so many remnants here that were abandoned even by death.   
   
**???:**  
Exactly what you just said...   
   
**???:**  
This place will be overflowing with those remnants, and much sorrow and pain as well.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
So you're here. The last Heroic Spirit I prepared. The first spear of the glorious knights from the Fenian Cycle.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou!?   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
My true name is Diarmuid Ua Duibhne. I've been summoned as a Lancer for this temporary contract.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
I will fight with you for the last trial. Scáthach, shield maiden, and my temporary Master.   
   
**Mash:**   
Diarmuid Ua Duibhne! A hero from the second age of Celtic myths, the Fenian Cycle.   
   
**Mash:**   
He brought glory to the Knights of Fianna along with the god-slaying hero, Fionn mac Cumhaill. Then...   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
...   
   
**Mash:**   
Uh...   
   
**Mash:**   
Sorry. I should have kept my mouth shut.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
What do you mean?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Did you say something bad?  
   
  
---  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
No. Fret not, shield maiden. The incidents in the legend were a result of my own disloyalty and lack of virtue.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
The hero's end was betrayal and death. A man of glory isn't guaranteed a happy ending.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
That goes for more than just Diarmuid. The greater the admiration for a hero...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
...the more likely they are to meet a tragic end. "I have no end," so it's not a concern for me.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Thinking back, yes... Not even Sétanta's end was a happy one.   
   
**Mash:**   
Scáthach...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
No, this is where you laugh, Mash. Celtic men leave behind nothing but tears and rage for their women.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
If you don't laugh, you'll end up hating them. Of course, that's not an absolute rule.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
It's true that I regret my end. That's why my lance can be of aid to you.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Even if this is a temporary contract, a Master is no different than a liege lord.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you, Diarmuid.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Let's fight together.  
   
  
---  
   
**Diarmuid:**   
...What a pleasant response... There are no lies in your heart, are there?   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Then I, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, shall become your spear with all my spirit!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Yes, yes. I figured you'd get along. Diarmuid prefers Masters who are exactly what they seem to be.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I've raised so many warriors that I think I've got a good eye for when people will get along.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You're like a goddess of relationships.  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Well, I'm nothing of the sort, but... I don't mind being told that.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Heh. That's an interesting idea, Fujimaru. Goddess of Relationships... I might think about that...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're like an old matchmaking aunt.  
   
**Mash:**   
S-Senpai! N-N-No! That's so rude...   
   
**Mash:**   
N-No, I don't mean there's anything wrong with being an old matchmaking lady, but...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hmm, I see, I see. You want to die. You want to die here, huh Fujimaru?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Mash's phrasing isn't too bad, though. Lady. That sounds elegant. I like it.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Well, the fact is, in human years I'm over 2000 years old. It doesn't bother me that much, and I haven't had the chance anyway.   
   
**Mash:**   
The chance?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hehehe. Don't worry about it. Perhaps I'll tell you someday, but not now.   
   
  
---  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Now then. Enough fun. The last remnant approaches.   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, fooou! Kyuu!   
   
**???:**  
   
**Mash:**   
I sense a Heroic Spirit, or no...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
The Heroic Spirit Orion. Or no, your true name is&mdash; one of the old gods of Mt. Olympus. Artemis, the moon goddess.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
But what gave you that form? Oh, I see. The tales of you falling in love with a human are true.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
That explains your human form, but...   
   
**Fou:**   
Fou, foouuu! Kyuu!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
What's wrong, Fou?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
F-Fou is really excited!  
   
  
---  
   
**Scáthach:**   
Perhaps that beast understands. Yes. This avatar of the moon goddess is another remnant abandoned by death.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Its ferocity and savagery... Oh, it rivals that cursed boar!   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Yes, the ancient moon goddess had another side, a cruel one that would spread plagues, bring death, and drive men mad.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
The gods are not always a blessing to humanity. Sometimes, like this, they will bare their fangs just like mother nature.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
That's why we, the Knights of Fianna, were once needed in ancient Erin.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
To protect the people from demons. To protect them from the gods.   
   
**???:**  
   
**Mash:**   
The ferocity...of a god... I feel an incredible animosity and urge to kill!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I wonder if this remnant is from your past, or from your future.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Whichever it is, an avatar of a god is still a god!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Hahahaha! It's been so long since I've killed a god! I'm excited!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
I'll kill you, Artemis! It's disgusting that you would take a "human form."   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Scáthach, you're really excited!  
   
**Scáthach:**   
It's been so, so long since I've fought a Mediterranean god! I can't wait!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
YEAH!  
   
**Scáthach:**   
A splendid answer from the heart, Fujimaru!   
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
... ...   
   
**Mash:**   
...We're going to fight a god. A Divine Spirit. No, but it's an avatar.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It's okay. Just calm down and do it like always.  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes, I'm fine.   
   
**Mash:**   
Whether this is a dream, or reality, if I'm with you I can fight!   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Here it comes! Are you guys ready?   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Artemis:**   
...Oh?   
   
**Artemis:**   
Oh dear, oh dear... I feel like I've been very mean to you.   
   
**Artemis:**   
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Even though Darling didn't tell me to, I...   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
...It was only for one battle, but if I was of use to you, there is no greater joy.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Shield maiden, temporary Master. Someday, beyond the end of time, we may meet.   
   
**Diarmuid:**   
Farewell. Scáthach... A million thanks for your compassion.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Thank you, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Is this...the end?  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, Senpai...   
   
**Mash:**   
Scáthach said this was the last remnant. Which means we should be done?   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Correct. You get a perfect score. Now, since that's done...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
This is as far as I go. The overflowing remnants have been removed from your hearts.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
So there's no need for me to force myself to stay in this realm.   
   
**Fou:**   
Foou, fou...   
   
**Mash:**   
Scáthach...   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Even if you die, you will never become remnants. So there's nothing to fear... Though I suppose it's cruel to say that.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
Fear, tremble, and yet stand against a pride that would incinerate even death.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
If nothing else, you've done it once.   
   
**Scáthach:**   
So it should be just as easy to do it again, or three times, or a hundred. Do your jobs, and become the heroes who restored humanity.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I can't do it a hundred times, Scáthach!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
YEAH!  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
...Yes. We'll do our best until the end.   
   
**Fou:**   
Foou!   
   
**Mash:**   
Oh, yes. And with Fou's help, too!
