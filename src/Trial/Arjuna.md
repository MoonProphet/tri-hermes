# Trial Quest - Arjuna  
  
## Search for the Song of Gods  
  
**???:**  
&mdash;That moment, I continue to repeat that moment.   
  
**???:**  
Throughout the continued repetition of human history, that moment in my life... Even if it is insignificant in all that has happened...   
  
**???:**  
Even if it was just me slaying my enemy.   
  
**???:**  
The indescribable sadness, anger, happiness, and more than anything&mdash;relief, I can still remember it.   
  
**???:**  
...Relief.   
Yes, that can only be called "relief."   
  
**???:**  
Like when a scab is torn off, it's an odd pleasure. The fear that sent a shiver up my spine, it too has vanished into thin air.   
  
**???:**  
But I was unable to touch the arrow that I myself had shot. Nor was I able to claim his head.   
  
**???:**  
I could only stand there, dazed&mdash;and accept the glorious victory.   
  
**???:**  
...   
...   
  
**???:**  
...up.   
  
**???:**  
Wake up, good fellow.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
???---  
  
   
**???:**  
Are you all right?   
  
**???:**  
Napping during a storm such as this, you must have some nerves of steel.   
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Where in the world am I?  
  
   
**???:**  
Good question.   
...To be perfectly honest, I do not know myself.   
  
**???:**  
When I awoke, I was on this ship, being tossed about in this storm.   
  
**???:**  
I have knowledge of how to steer a ship, but I'm afraid all we can do is ride this out.   
  
**???:**  
As that is the case, I decided that I should speak with you, since you were leisurely napping here. Also, I had nothing better to do, either.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Who are you?  
  
   
**???:**  
...I'm not sure how to answer that.   
You see, I am not entirely sure myself.   
  
**???:**  
I am a nameless man. The only thing that I remember is that I am an Archer Servant.   
  
---   
  
**???:**  
...I also have no idea where this ship will take us.   
Though I am a Servant, I don't even know who I am.   
  
**???:**  
It does seem that you are my Master.   
If possible, may I accompany you for a while?   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That is fine.  
  
**???:**  
Thank you. My name... Though I do not know it, I am sure I am an Archer Servant.   
  
**???:**  
It is nice to meet you, Master.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Where is Mash?  
  
**???:**  
Mash? I am not sure...   
There may be someone else inside this ship.   
  
---   
  
**Mash:**   
Master!?   
Are you here, Master!?   
  
**Mash:**   
Senpai&mdash;!   
  
**???:**  
Who is that?   
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A dependable Servant.  
  
**Mash:**   
Thank goodness, Master.   
I'm so glad you're all right.   
  
**Mash:**   
Yes, I am (Your Name) Senpai's Servant.   
My name is Mash Kyrielight!   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
My charming Kohai.  
  
   
**Mash:**   
What? Charming Kohai...   
Oh, I am hardly that...   
  
**Mash:**   
No, I am still very much your Servant!   
You must call me dependable!   
  
**Mash:**   
But...at any rate...   
Thank you...   
  
**Fou:**   
Fou!   
  
---   
  
**Mash:**   
Here is our situation, Master.   
  
**Mash:**   
Apparently, during the Rayshift, we were blown off course by a strange Singularity.   
  
**Mash:**   
Unfortunately, we're unable to contact the Doctor.   
  
**Mash:**   
By the way, who is that person?   
He looks like a well-known Servant somehow.   
  
**???:**  
Unfortunately, I seem to have left my identity behind.   
  
**???:**  
However, I do know that I am an Archer. As you can see, I carry a bow for a weapon. So quite obviously I am.   
  
**Mash:**   
Well, uhm...Excuse me. I don't mean to seem rude, but that's not a Class that can be determined by one's weapon.   
  
**Mash:**   
In this world where an Archer can wield two swords ([[Emiya]]), or strike with a club ([[Orion]])...   
  
**Mash:**   
...and even hurl valuable treasures at random ([[Gilgamesh]])...   
  
**Mash:**   
It's a bit premature to assume you're an Archer just because you carry a bow.   
  
**Archer:**   
There is quite a variety of heroes in the world, it seems...   
  
**Mash:**   
By the way, Senpai, what were you doing... Were you napping?   
  
**Mash:**   
That is so like you, Senpai. You've been like that since I found you sound asleep in the corridor at Chaldea!   
  
**Mash:**   
There's no way I can even relax. In fact, I feel a little sick...   
  
**Mash:**   
No matter how many times I've been through this, I still can't get used to a ship deck during a storm...   
  
**Archer:**   
Though this ship is quite sturdy, there could still be trouble if the storm continues...   
  
**Archer:**   
What was that?   
  
**Mash:**   
A Ghost-type enemy.   
Excuse me, but we could use your help!   
  
  
## (Part 2)  
  
**Mash:**   
We have annihilated them.   
Well done, Master.   
  
**Archer:**   
...How humiliating.   
I was hardly any help at all. I'm so ashamed.   
  
**Mash:**   
N-No, not at all.   
I'm just glad we're all right.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You seemed like you had doubts.  
  
   
**Archer:**   
...You have a keen eye.   
That's exactly right. I...have doubts about fighting.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Don't you want to fight?  
  
   
**Archer:**   
A skilled Master must be able to understand a Servant, even if the Servant is not their own.   
  
**Archer:**   
That's right. For me -- battle carries only melancholy with it.   
  
---   
  
**Mash:**   
Why is that?   
  
**Archer:**   
I know not my True Name, nor how many Holy Grail Wars I fought, nor how many I emerged from victorious.   
  
**Archer:**   
...But I don't think I have been defeated.   
I have the utmost confidence in my abilities.   
  
**Archer:**   
If I suffered a terrible defeat, Master certainly would have ordered me to commit suicide.   
  
**Mash:**   
T-Talk about confidence!   
But what he says is not a lie, Senpai!   
  
**Archer:**   
Perhaps I remained undefeated when I was alive as well That is precisely why it is all feels so empty.   
  
**Archer:**   
Whether I am victorious or defeated...   
  
**Archer:**   
It is all just an infinitesimal ship washed away by the enormous waves of time.   
  
**Archer:**   
The joy of victory has no meaning.   
The humiliation of defeat has no meaning.   
  
**Archer:**   
Therefore, nothing has any meaning.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Even your life now?  
  
   
**Archer:**   
...That's right. It is not easy for me to say, but that is the present condition I am in.   
  
**Archer:**   
If it were not for your presence, Master, I most likely would have abandoned the battle.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Even death?  
  
   
**Archer:**   
I am a Servant to begin with... I am sure I belonged to the warrior class long before as well.   
  
**Archer:**   
Therefore, I have no fear of death.   
  
---   
  
  
**Lancer:**   
That's not true, Archer.   
You are not a warrior unafraid of death.   
  
**Archer:**   
...!?   
  
**Mash:**   
Huh? Who was that!?   
  
**Lancer:**   
The man you are now is not someone unafraid of death.   
You merely have not seen death.   
  
**Lancer:**   
You achieved so much glory so easily and with so little challenge that you ended up tired of life.   
  
**Lancer:**   
Your philosophy has led you to nothing more than desperation. You merely have a low opinion of your own existence.   
  
**Lancer:**   
That's not even martyrdom.   
I won't allow you to take that path!   
  
**Archer:**   
...Who...are you?   
No, wait... Who am I?   
  
**Lancer:**   
...How infuriating! Even though I proclaim the truth, you still do not understand.   
  
**Lancer:**   
The one and only person in this world that I cannot accept. That one person is you, bowman!   
  
**Archer:**   
...ugh!   
  
**Lancer:**   
A wild and crude shot. Is that the best you can do?   
Then you had better restring your bow.   
  
**Mash:**   
Archer!?   
  
**Mash:**   
Calm down, please! He's not an ally, but that doesn't make him an enemy!   
  
**Archer:**   
...I know. I know that, but...   
That man&mdash;I won't stand for him!   
  
**Archer:**   
I cannot stand your presence.   
For whatever reason, I cannot stand your presence!   
  
**Lancer:**   
&mdash;Now that's a little more like it.   
That fury. That unreasonable malevolence.   
  
**Lancer:**   
That arrogance is what makes you who you are. That aura of righteous anger is most fitting for the man who carries that bow.   
  
**Lancer:**   
Fire away without reservation.   
Come on, don't hold back.   
  
**Lancer:**   
I won't pull any punches either.   
I will run my shadow lance through your throat!   
  
  
<h3>(After Battle)</h3>  
  
**Archer:**   
Haa, haa, haa...   
  
**Lancer:**   
A tenacity that ignores the Class affinity...   
Our fates are truly intertwined.   
  
**Lancer:**   
...But that is all for now.   
We must each again inquire of the Bhagavad-Gita.   
  
**Lancer:**   
We can continue this after that is finished. ...the Master over there, and the one who watched over that Master.   
  
**Lancer:**   
...I know it may be a burden to you, but I want you to guide him. You're the only ones who can do it.   
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Do you need guidance as well?  
  
   
**Lancer:**   
...Itâ€˜s unnecessary.   
But I do appreciate the offer.   
  
**Lancer:**   
As long as that man is present, I will be your enemy.   
  
**Lancer:**   
The same is true if reversed as well.   
  
**Lancer:**   
A hated enemy is a necessary ingredient of myth.   
I am truly used to playing that part.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But for what purpose?  
  
   
**Lancer:**   
I have no obligation to answer my enemies.   
What I am after is insignificant.   
  
---   
  
**Archer:**   
Master, a while ago I said that I had tired of living.   
  
**Archer:**   
That is the sincere truth.   
My thirst for battle has also faded.   
  
**Archer:**   
However...   
even so...   
  
**Archer:**   
I cannot abide that Lancer.   
I know this feeling I have is unreasonable...   
  
**Archer:**   
That man is most certainly a righteous person.   
  
**Archer:**   
He is recognized by the people and is a hero who devotes himself to doing virtuous deeds.   
  
**Archer:**   
But still, I truly, for some reason, want to battle him.   
  
**Archer:**   
No, it's not a desire to battle.   
I want to deny him. Deny all of him. Everything.   
  
**Archer:**   
...I am certain this is an unforgivable request.   
This is an improper desire.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
It is not improper.---  
  
**Archer:**   
Not improper? What do you mean?   
  
   
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Most certainly he is your mortal enemy.  
  
   
**Archer:**   
My mortal...enemy.   
  
**Archer:**   
...   
...   
  
**Archer:**   
I see.   
Those words have hit home.   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Then you should go on a quest for that answer.  
  
   
**Archer:**   
Go on a...quest?   
  
**Archer:**   
...   
...   
  
**Archer:**   
You may be right.   
To find out who the man is that boils my blood...   
  
**Archer:**   
...and to find out who I am.   
I should search for those answers.   
  
---   
  
---  
  
   
**Archer:**   
...It seems the storm has passed as well, as if waking from a dream.   
  
**Archer:**   
I am ever a wanderer.   
  
**Archer:**   
If we meet again in reality, I would be glad if we could find those answers together.   
  
**Archer:**   
&mdash;Farewell, my Master.   
I look forward to the day that we may meet again.
