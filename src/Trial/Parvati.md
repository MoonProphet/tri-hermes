# Trial Quest - Parvati  
  
## A Lady Descends to Fuyuki  
   
**Mash:**   
All systems green. Rayshift is a success.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Good, good. Now then, Fujimaru.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Let me go over this again: you're in Fuyuki, a rural Japanese city.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You're here to investigate the odd reading we got in this area.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So...see anything?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Anything or anyone that seems out of place or that catches your attention in your general vicinity?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Let's see...  
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
There is a woman...dressed in Indian attire...  
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hmmm...   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Ah, good work, Fujimaru. Looks like you got it in one!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
She's definitely the source of the odd reading we got. Looks like she's a Servant.   
   
**Mash:**   
But she is no ordinary Servant. I'm getting a Divine Spirit response from her.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh-ho. I knew this would be a special case since Sheba interpreted it as irregular when we detected it, but I never imagined it would be a Divine Spirit Servant.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
She doesn't seem hostile, but we don't know what's going to happen. Proceed with caution, Fujimaru.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Okay... Um, excuse me, do you have a moment?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hello. You there. Can I speak to you for a bit...?  
  
---  
   
**A：???:**  
!? Eh? Uh, yes...? Wh-what is it!?   
   
**A：???:**  
Um, I know I've been wandering around the same spot for a while now...   
   
**A：???:**  
So of course you think I'm suspicious, but I promise I am absolutely not a shady sort!   
   
**A：???:**  
...Oh?   
   
**A：???:**  
...   
   
**A：???:**  
Um, forgive me if I'm wrong, but...   
   
**A：???:**  
Are you by chance a Master who has formed a contract with a Servant...?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Indeed I am.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I contract with lots of Servants.  
  
---  
   
**A：???:**  
Oh, wonderful. Then I don't have to explain all the basics to you.   
   
**A：???:**  
I'm not the least bit shady. I am&ndash;get this&ndash;a wayward Servant who has nothing to hide!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, thanks for that polite explanation. But it's not just about being polite.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
(She acts like the passive type, but she's got a heck of a stubborn attitude...)   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
(Despite her appearance, she's almost certainly no pushover. Be careful, Fujimaru)   
   
**Mash:**   
That's not nice, Da Vinci. She was honest about being a wayward Servant...   
   
**Mash:**   
And while I know neither her circumstances, nor her True Name, I am sure she is a wonderful Servant!   
   
**A：???:**  
Oh, are they your friends? It's nice to be in such a lively group.   
   
**A：???:**  
They are transmitting their voices from somewhere across both space and time...am I correct?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yeah, that's a great interpretation. It's nice to have a Divine Spirit who's quick on the uptake.   
   
**A：???:**  
You can tell I'm a Divine Spirit...a goddess Servant? Even with my weakened Spirit Origin?   
   
**Mash:**   
Y-yes. It's difficult to explain, but we have encountered our share of goddesses. And every one of them has been pretty...distinctive...   
   
**A：???:**  
Oh my. What wonderful encounters. You must have gone through intensive training.   
   
**A：???:**  
I don't know which goddesses you encountered, nor do I know what kind of humans were used as vessels...   
   
**A：???:**  
But since you already understand the basics, I see no reason to hide my identity. Allow me to formally introduce myself:   
   
**A：???:**  
I am Pārvatī. I've manifested here using this girl's body as a vessel... She is someone to whom I am attuned in both body and soul.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Pārvatī...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
A vessel? So, a Pseudo-Servant!?  
   
  
---  
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Yes. It has been something of a confluence of coincidences.   
   
**Mash:**   
Pārvatī is a famous goddess from Indian myth.   
   
**Mash:**   
She is the divine wife of Shiva, and is the embodiment of kindness and grace. She doesn't seem to be a dangerous Divine Spirit, which is a relief.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yeah. If that woman is really Pārvatī, you're not in immediate danger.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
After all, there really aren't any myths about Pārvatī doing battle.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Goddesses tend to be pretty fickle. They just love punishing humans at even the slightest hint of provocation or disrespect.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But as long as she is truly Pārvatī, anything dark&ndash;Wait a minute...   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
A goddess who's portfolio includes beauty and gentleness... This is bad. Really bad!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Because she's not a goddess of war and beauty, but she's exclusively a goddess of beauty! She's the same! The same as me!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Let's just put Da Vinci's antics aside...   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm curious about the individual who became her vessel. Um, excuse me, Miss Pārvatī...   
   
**Mash:**   
May I ask what has happened to the owner of that body of yours?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
You're asking about the state of this body's owner... I didn't think you would ask that question so quickly...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
You're bold, though you seem mild-mannered. Or, at least, you're certainly cautious. You have the kouhai thing going on, and we have similar personalities...   
   
**Mash:**   
Um, Miss Pārvatī?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Nothing. Were I in your shoes, I would have asked the same question.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
The original owner of this body is not here.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
That is... She isn't asleep, and she hasn't been destroyed or anything...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Being a Divine Spirit, this is embarrassing to admit, but she and I merged together seamlessly♡   
   
**Mash:**   
M-merged!? D-does that mean...   
   
**Mash:**   
The human girl's soul...um, embraced the Divine Spirit Pārvatī...or rather, didn't lose to you...?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Oh, I know...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I may not be a god of war, but even so, to be able to retake control from a Divine Heroic Spirit...I'm speechless myself.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
This body is...well, it's basically me now. You know, I'm told that I am gloomy, scary, strong-willed...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
My memories and behavior are all Pārvatī, but expressed through her personality.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
We combined our good aspects and cut away the bad parts in a sort of mutual consensus, creating a new Pseudo-Servant.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
The girl's past and memories were sealed when we merged. After all, no human can bear the full weight of a god's mind and memories.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
But in exchange, my preferences and decision-making were all entrusted to her human nature.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
This may be hard to understand, but...let's see... Are you familiar with the concept of magical girls?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I'm not too far off from that concept. It's a temporary state I can't change back from, but were I to do so, I would forget everything as soon as I did.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Magical girl...I get it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I don't know much about magical girls,but I think I get the idea.  
   
  
---  
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hm. I figured we'd find a vessel once I knew we were dealing with a Divine Spirit, but this is a pretty far cry from what we saw in Uruk.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
In that case, it was a goddess using a human as her core, but this seems to be a human using a goddess as her own core.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Either way, that girl must have some sort of connection with the Holy Grail and Servants.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Typically, the human the god's compatible with is just used as a vessel. The god puts a small part of their power into the vessel and kind of forces their way into that person to manifest as a Servant.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
At least, that's how it usually works for a Pseudo-Servant. You seem to be something of a special case, though.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But ultimately, you're not really much different from the other Divine Spirits in Chaldea.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Oh, so there are others like me. That's good to know.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I'm not particularly comfortable with excessive fear or worship from those around me.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I would very much like for you to interact with me naturally, just like how you treat anyone else.   
   
**Mash:**   
Thank you for your concern, Pārvatī. By the way&ndash;   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Oh, you can call me Par. My name is kind of long and a bit hard to say, don't you think?   
   
**Mash:**   
O-okay... I'm a little apprehensive about that, but... Very well, Par...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Okay! Hee hee. This is my first time going by a nickname. I'm really being quite sociable, aren't I? That makes me happy.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
The owner of this body and I are both naturally very shy.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
But by combining the best parts of ourselves, I believe we're better able to speak our mind and not be so timid.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
We can assert ourselves and say what we like.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Just that fact makes this manifestation worth it.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So, Par...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What's a goddess like you doing in a place like this?  
  
---  
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Oh yes, I forgot! There's no time for me to be standing around here being all happy!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Um, well, simply put, I'm looking for something. I know it's around here somewhere.   
   
**Mash:**   
You mean in Fuyuki, during this age?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Yes. This city seems to have some sort of connection to my body...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
And so I thought that if I wandered this place, I would eventually come across it...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
But this Fuyuki seems to be different than the one my body is familiar with...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Embarrassing as it is to admit, I seem to have gotten lost and landed myself in a bit of a bind...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see...  
   
**Mash:**   
Now that we know what's going on, what do you think, Senpai? Should we help out Par?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Yeah. If that's her reason for being there, granting her wish will definitely lead us to some answers.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Want us to help?  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes. We do have some connection with Fuyuki, and we can provide a bit of backup from here.   
   
**Mash:**   
We may be able to be of some help.   
   
  
---  
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Well, if you really want to, then I'd welcome it! But...are you sure you want to help me? We only just met.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Nod)  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
(Give a thumbs up)  
  
---  
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Oh, what kindhearted people you are! I must show my appreciation for your generosity!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
...Oh, my apologies. I have yet to learn your names. May I ask what they are?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I'm Fujimaru.  
  
---  
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Fujimaru. So your name is Fujimaru...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Yes, I think that is a wonderful name. Pleased to meet you, Fujimaru!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
And...Miss Mash and Miss Genius Da Vinci!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
So the thing you're looking for...do you have any other clues other than that it's in this city?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Um...no... This is more of an instinctual thing, so I think I would know if it were nearby...   
   
**Mash:**   
Then we have no choice but to search the area.   
   
**Mash:**   
Let's map out the area, and we'll keep track of where you've covered as you do it.   
   
**Mash:**   
This could take awhile, but if you just do it bit by bit, I'm sure we'll find what Par is looking for eventually.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Wow...and I thought you were the same sort as me, but you take initiative much more than I do, Mash!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
But that is very promising! Running into you is the best thing that could have happened to me here. I'm so lucky!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Now let's get going! I'm counting on everyone!   
   
**Mash:**   
By the way, Par, that thing you're carrying... Is that a lance?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh yeah, I was wondering the same. Your Class is Lancer, right?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But I've never heard of Pārvatī carrying a lance...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Oh, you're right. This actually isn't mine.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I borrowed it from my husband, Shiva.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Ah, that's Shiva's trident, Trishula? So that's why you're a Lancer.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Since I'm only borrowing it, I can't do nearly as much with it as Shiva could.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
And I customized it a little so I could use it easier.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
It's probably far from what a lance should look like... Well, no, it's probably just not as cool because I'm the one who customized it.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I...may be a goddess, but I'm kind of a klutz.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ummm...  
   
**Mash:**   
No, that's not true! No matter how clumsy you are, I am sure you're a very diligent worker, Par!   
   
**Mash:**   
I have absolutely no reason to believe that, but I'm certain of it because...because I feel such a close connection with you!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Mash!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
You're no klutz! You're beautiful, goddess!  
   
**Pārvatī:**   
R-really? You think so!? You speak so much more passionately than I could... You make me blush!   
   
  
---  
   
**Pārvatī:**   
But hearing you say that about me gives me so much confidence!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I may not have as much firepower as Shiva, but since I've manifested...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
That proves that I am a full-fledged Lancer Servant! Hi-yah!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Hi-yah...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Um... What was that wobbly move?  
   
  
---  
   
**Pārvatī:**   
It's...it's a “hi-yah!” It's what all martial artists shout...!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
...Ungh. Drat. You're doubting me now, aren't you?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I know I'm a beginner at being a Lancer, but I am still a goddess!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I may not look cool, but I'm definitely really strong when I fight. Probably.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
If an enemy comes, I'll just slap, slap, slap them. Like this!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I may borrow Shiva's power, but I still plan on doing it my way: by being splendid and graceful!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Don't worry. I won't summon any weird shadows or anything!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Eh? (What does she mean by “weird shadows”?)   
   
**Mash:**   
(I think she's trying to show that she's strong, in her own way...)   
   
**Mash:**   
(It might be rude of me to say this, but she seems more elegant and cute, really...)   
   
**Mash:**   
(A goddess will always be a goddess, I suppose...)   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
That's why, even if we encounter enemies on our way, there's nothing to worry about, Fujimaru.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
You were all kind when I was in a tough spot. Now, I swear on my honor as a goddess...I will protect you all!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hm... Normally, you wouldn't expect much from a goddess like Pārvatī in a melee battle...   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But it's a different story if you consider the mythology surrounding her. If you trace her roots, you'll find quite the warlike&ndash;   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Oh? That's...   
   
**Mash:**   
Is that...Cursed Arm over there?   
   
**Mash:**   
It looks like he's doing something shifty by the road. I wonder...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
...   
   
**Mash:**   
Par?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I'm not sure, but...I sense something.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
He is a bad man.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Well, that might be TECHNICALLY true in terms of alignment...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I feel that...we need to proceed with extreme caution. This feeling is bubbling up within me...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
And, what should I call it... It's just a vague association, but there's a smell on him that bothers me...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
It's like...this terrible...smell of bugs...?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
It's all very instinctual, and I can't express it very well...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
But anyway! The fact of the matter is that he is an evil man!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
And a goddess like me simply cannot allow that to stand!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Fuuu...haaa (deep breaths)...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Hold it right there, suspicious masked man!   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Oh? Are you perhaps addressing me?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Well, you're the only masked man around!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Well... If those weirdo Island Masks were around...  
   
  
---  
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Hahaha. Very true. What business do you have with me?   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
I see a young lady who has been glaring at me for the past few minutes...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
As I believe that sincere words will reach even those who are evil, I will ask you this:   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
What are you doing here?   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
What am I doing? Hmmm, now that I think of it, that is quite a profound question.   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Many factors have led me here. However, to put it simply...   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Perhaps it is best to say that I am disposing of those who are empty, or those who've lost their place...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Wh-what did you say!?   
   
**Mohawk:**   
Heh heh heh... Sir! I've found some! There's a ton over by the river!   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Oh, so it seems... Let's head over right away. This is very exciting, hahaha...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
H-he even has some mean-looking minions...!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
They have some nerve. I mean...wait a minute!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I know that the modern world is full of wicked, soulless people who have lost their way!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
But even so, as a goddess, they are all my beloved children!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I will not turn a blind eye to the senseless murder of innocents!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Stay right where you are, you murdering assassin. It's probably not hard to tell, but I am mad!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
(Tremble)  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
That look on Par's face...! She's intimidating even for a goddess!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Bingo. Pārvatī is usually described only as Shiva's wife...a goddess who is very mild-mannered...   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
But since she is Shiva's wife, Pārvatī is often identified with his OTHER wife, Durga, who is the goddess of battle...   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
And on top of that, she is also identified as Kali, who was born from the two gods. Long story short, if you get Pārvatī mad, she's terrifying!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
This is no time for idle chatter.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
If you are truly a disciple of justice, you cannot let these evil men walk free!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Now come, Fujimaru! We must give these nasty, bug-smelling murderers divine punishment!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Ugh! There's no reason to fight to the death here! I'll just be the bigger man and say you got me!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Oh my... You're a lot more accommodating than I expected.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
So that horrid, filthy scent of insects was just something that rubbed off onto you? You must scrub hard to get the smell off of you, understood?   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Well, not really, but men, put your weapons down. Do as this woman says.   
   
**Mohawk:**   
Damn! Why!?   
   
**Mohawk:**   
But we just met you, our mentor...and we were on the verge of bettering ourselves...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Bettering yourselves?  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Um...I'm going to ask you again.   
   
**Mash:**   
What were you doing here? Can you tell us again?   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
...? I don't remember lying to you, so my answer has not changed. I'm disposing of those that are empty&mdash;   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sorry, can you please clarify? Without the poetic assassin phrasing...   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Hm...so it wasn't clear, huh? Well, let me put it in plainer terms...   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
We were picking up all the empty bottles and cans people left here. What of it?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
But you're a Hassan!!!   
   
**Mash:**   
What does that matter?   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
I had some time on my hands, so I pick up things that can be recycled. I'm the sort who collects all the daggers I throw from the battlefield.   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
And this habit has left it somewhat painful for me to see the culture of fast consumption in this age. It can be so terribly wasteful.   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
After a while, the young men who had time and shared in my beliefs gathered here and began to assemble and volunteer their time to assist me.   
   
**Mohawk:**   
Yeah...our mentor became known for turning our delinquent ways around for the better...   
   
**Mohawk:**   
Hawkmo from third street even landed his dream job at an IT company...and I am also going to start work at this company called Gold Mansomething.   
   
**Mohawk:**   
You shouldn't judge people by their looks, you know... What matters is leading an honest, hardworking life!   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Hahaha. Indeed. They can save face and regain something of an identity. Heh.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
(Grr... I don't know why, but he gets on my nerves. Maybe we had a connection in our past lives...)   
   
**Mohawk:**   
Can I keep talking? Um...   
   
**Mohawk:**   
Right. Even if he was judged by his looks, no matter what his past was, our mentor's unwavering spirit to keep going was what attracted us to him.   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Heh, you think too much of me, boy. But a little flattery never hurt anyone. Keep going.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
But...you're still an assassin, correct?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Aren't you the bad guy of all bad guys who, under the orders of a bug-smelling Master, killed both humans and Servants!?   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
...? I don't quite know what you mean.   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Yes, I am an assassin...a nominally evil being.   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
But now, I am first and foremost the Servant of Master Fujimaru.   
   
**Cursed Arm:**   
Without being ordered to do so, I would certainly never attack at random.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I forgot to mention...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
But Hassan is actually a nice guy.  
  
---  
   
**Pārvatī:**   
...!!!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
...A-ah...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Such a thing is possible!? I'm terribly sorry! I am such klutz in every possible way!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Oh...I can't believe I did that... I feel just awful...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Don't think too much about it...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
No worries! It happens!  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Master is right, Par.   
   
**Mash:**   
Anyone can make mistakes, you know! Even Hassan laughed it off and forgave you!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That said, we were all a bit shocked at how mad you got!   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
You too, right, Fujimaru?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
That incredible&ndash;if dark&ndash;fighting spirit that was practically pouring from you...it sure reinforced that you are definitely a god!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Now I know not to make you mad.  
  
---  
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Please don't talk about it! All that anger and it was just a misunderstanding... I'm so embarrassed...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Ahem... Well, there's one tiny bit of silver lining!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Compared to what happens when I'm REALLY angry, that was just the tip of the iceberg.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Fortunately, since I'm a Pseudo-Servant, I am one hundred percent good, wholesome goddess!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I won't let that destructive negativity out so easily!   
   
**Mash:**   
Um, are you trying to say that your REAL anger is even more intense than what we saw?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
...(Smile)   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That wasn't much of an answer,but let's try not to tick her off.  
  
---  
   
**Pārvatī:**   
No, you don't have to worry too much.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
What I mean is that you will never see my true fury.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
What I'm looking for isn't around here...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Maybe it is that I'm still unused to this since I just manifested...   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh hey, I meant to ask you. Why did you manifest in the first place?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Does it have to do with what you're looking for?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Oh, no. What I'm seeking is more of a bonus. Or, well, it's sort of all in my mind.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
There is a legitimate reason for my manifestation. It's very difficult to put into words though...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
But let's see...it feels like there is something that I must do...   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Hm. If you manifested as a Servant, that means you will need a Master to help you accomplish whatever it is you want to do.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
What do you think?   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
I can very confidently put forward Fujimaru as highly recommended Master.   
   
**Mash:**   
I agree wholeheartedly. Senpai truly is a reliable Master.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
R-right. I completely forgot. A Servant needs a Master.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Fujimaru is...of course, a pure and just individual.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
You're right. It would be best for me to continue receiving Fujimaru's support... (Stare)   
   
**A：???:**  
Wait, wait, wait!!! You're not getting away! Pink aerial stunts are a no-no!   
   
**Mash:**   
Ah! That voice...?   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
(Providing minimal explanation) I'm pawtrolling my territory... That's right, it's mew!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
A wild animal appears!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yep, pretty much a cat. Sneaking in without being called.  
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Jaguar Warrior? Why are you here?   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Shut up, you purrpetrator! This is Jaguar's territory!   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Power over life and death...love and death...fish or beef! Know that everything hinges on the whims of the mistress of this territory...ME!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Teacher...! That is such an absurd role!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Um...I actually don't know why I called that thing a teacher... It just came out!   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Of course you did. This Jaguar actually stands above all living creatures to be an example to all! I'm the ultimate creature of eduCATion!   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
I'm gonna give you a snippet of truth! Eating meat makes you super happy, and naptime is the doorway to your dreams!   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Heh. I tried to make it sound Nirvana-y because there's an Indian goddess in front of me. What do you think? No good? Aww...I see.   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Whatever. I'm being super generous today! Take a look at Student No. EX, who also worships me!   
   
**Illya:**   
Actually she just dragged me out here! And why are you calling me Student No. EX!?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Um...actually, that girl is even more of a rare case than we are. Maybe you could leave her out...?   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Ah! The gang's back together... I'm feeling invincible! I've clinched this!   
   
**Illya:**   
Arrrgh, this is nuts... Although I kind of understand instinctively calling her “teacher.”   
   
**Illya:**   
But...there is someone I've never met with Master. Oh, she's so pretty...   
   
**Illya:**   
Anyway, I should politely introduce myself to people when I meet them for the first time. Hello, big sister!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
...Yes, hello, Illyasviel. My name is Pārvatī.   
   
**Illya:**   
Huh? Did I say my name already?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
The world and distant space sometimes align by sheer coincidence, like the light hitting a kaleidoscope to form a distinct and dazzling pattern...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Our encounter must be like that kind of miracle. Either way, I'm glad to see that you are well and happy, Illyasviel.   
   
**Illya:**   
O-okay... Thanks...?   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Hey! Trying to chat up my student is furbidden!   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
I've heard enough, meow! This Jaguar is here to object to what you were talking about!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Um...what WERE we talking about?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
About Masters and their Servants...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
About a contract...  
  
---  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Right! That's it! I ask of you...!   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Ahhh, I've always wanted to say that line. It feels nice. I KNEW I was the real heroine!   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Anyway! I ask of you! Are you pawsitive you want to come to Chaldea!?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Ah, that was what we were talking about. And yes, if I have the chance...   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Listen, Chaldea is no ordinary place! Get this: Chaldea...   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Has Emiya...and Emiya...and even another Emiya! On top of that, there's even a pawsibility that more Emiyas will pop up one day!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Sukhavati!!!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I dunno, not sure there'll be more...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She's not lying...  
  
---  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Heh heh... So whaddaya think? Confused?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
...Yes. Very...confused!   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
I like your honesty! Now, do you really think the psyche of a serious kouhai-type would be able to withstand the ridiculous hell that is Chaldea!?   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Testing that resolve in a furrocious fight is the duty of an educator!   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Let's go, Student No. EX! Now is the time to show our senpai pawers, strengthened by having to endure that weird hell for so long!   
   
**Illya:**   
What!? So I'm on this side!? I don't want be on your side! I don't want to fight against Master!   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
You idiot! If you do a good job here, your dream of appearing in bloomers won't have to remain a dream!   
   
**Illya:**   
I don't want that either!   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Are you kitten me? Fine, then how about I help you do your homework for a week?   
   
**Illya:**   
...   
   
**Mash:**   
She stopped moving.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Trying to make an innocent girl do your work by bribing her makes you a terrible teacher! You must be punished!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Gaaah! How could this happen!? We're both Lancers! So this is what happens when you get a fourth star!   
   
**Illya:**   
Buh. I guess that means I have to do my homework on my own...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Game, set, and match.   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Urgh, so this is your resolve, huh? You've got true grit.   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
But let me ask you again, and this time I want your final answer!   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Cute girl who'd be cuter with some sakura petals decorating her: Do you really think you'd be happy if you came to Chaldea?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
...Yes, I think so.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
To be happy, to make someone else happy...or even to be happy BY making someone else happy...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I'm sure there are many different methods.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
But no matter what, as long as I am myself, I know the people around me will be happy!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Isn't that what being a goddess is about?   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Got it. If you have that much confidence in yourself, I have nothing more to say!   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
But...but! It's just too purrfect! It just doesn't feel right. Don't you need SOME kinda dark side to you!?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
(Glare)   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Ah-hem. Rest assured. I may have cut away the shadowy parts of myself, but make no mistake, there is such a thing as shadows in the light.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Fujimaru and the others are well aware that I am not JUST the pure, good parts of myself.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
That's why I am able to somewhat participate in battle. Like smacking people.   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Hm? Hmmm...well, that's not exactly what I meant...   
   
**Jaguar Warrior:**   
Oh, crap. I'm almost out of energy. Farewell, everyone! Look forward to the next exciting installment of the Jaguar Warrior show!   
   
**Illya:**   
She just does whatever she wants, doesn't she? Hmm... She looks an awful lot like someone I know.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Try not to think too hard and just go home.  
   
**Illya:**   
Okay! I'll do that!   
   
**Illya:**   
If something like this happens again, I'm sending Chloe instead. They both act like cats anyway, so they'll probably get along. Yep!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'll check your homework later.  
   
**Illya:**   
Really, Fujimaru!?   
   
**Illya:**   
Yay! I'll wait with tea and snacks at the ready!   
   
**Mash:**   
You really are kind, Senpai. If I didn't have work to do, I would have loved to join.   
   
**Mash:**   
While I do not have homework, I always feel that studying the books in the library is important.   
   
**Mash:**   
I'm sure I would make great progress in my studies if I asked Senpai lots of questions, and I'm sure it would be fun.   
   
  
---  
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Whew. Thanks to that mysterious jolly animal, we took an unexpected detour...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
But I have a feeling we're getting close to what I'm seeking!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
We just have a little more to go. Please bear with me, Fujimaru!   
   
**--ARROW--**  
   
**Pārvatī:**   
There it is! I'm sure that's it!   
   
**Mash:**   
Someone's standing over there...   
   
**Medusa:**   
You've finally come.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
She looks familiar...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Nobody would ever forget that figure!  
  
---  
   
**Medusa:**   
M-Master!? Why are you here!?   
   
**Medusa:**   
This is...well, this was not part of the plan.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
What are you doing? Those are MY clothes.   
   
**Da Vinci:**   
Oh, you found it? You were looking for that school uniform?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Yes. It's sort of...an object that acts as an anchor to maintain my existence. That Spiritron Dress should naturally be in my possession.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
But for some reason, the moment I manifested, I realized I didn't have it, and that it was somewhere else entirely.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
So I went looking for it by following its scent.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
And when you sense that someone else is wearing your precious clothes...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
You would never want to give them up, and go on a journey to find them, no matter what. Do you understand that feeling?   
   
**Mash:**   
Um...well...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
So...what is your intention?   
   
**Medusa:**   
Well...you see...   
   
**Medusa:**   
It is difficult to explain my actions...even for me.   
   
**Medusa:**   
After all, what I've done here was motivated by a sort of impulse that bubbled up from somewhere within me. But...at least half of my goal is accomplished now.   
   
**Mash:**   
...?   
   
**Medusa:**   
I used this school uniform as bait to lure you here, Pārvatī.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I see. So it was part of your plan to be found. So what is the other half of your goal?   
   
**Medusa:**   
Why, to eliminate you, of course.   
   
**Mash:**   
!?   
   
**Medusa:**   
While some may argue otherwise, I would say that I am doing what I am because we are both goddesses. I'm not certain myself, but my gut tells me...   
   
**Medusa:**   
...there's no need for you to fight if it means you have to use THAT vessel.   
   
**Medusa:**   
And since you've just became a Servant, hitting you with a sufficiently powerful Spiritual attack may cleave you apart from your vessel.   
   
**Medusa:**   
Doing so may entirely negate your existence as a Pseudo-Servant.   
   
**Medusa:**   
So there's no reason for me not to try it. My Spirit Core is compelling me to try...   
   
**Medusa:**   
Now, please...   
   
**Medusa:**   
Please return to the realm of the gods. I have nothing against you personally, but brace yourself!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
It looks like we can't talk this out.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I may not understand your reasoning, but I can see that you are resolved to do this. But...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I also have a purpose for being here, so I cannot allow myself to be sent away so easily.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
So, I will defend myself!   
   
**--BATTLE--**  
   
**Pārvatī:**   
This is the end. Please accept defeat.   
   
**Medusa:**   
Ungh...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
You don't look like you're willing to give up...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
...(Sigh)   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I suppose I have no choice... Please, allow me to speak to you, though I must make some assumptions to do so...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I am an Indian goddess, while you are from the Greek pantheon. Bluntly put, we have nothing in common.   
   
**Medusa:**   
That is...true...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Yet that doesn't seem to matter to you, and you are fighting fiercely to stop me.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
It is hard to believe you're doing this just because we are both goddesses.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Then, the answer is quite clear.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
You are concerned not about the goddess I am, but the girl whose body I inhabit.   
   
**Medusa:**   
...Nnngh...   
   
**Medusa:**   
That...is a valid point... I simply felt that you should not be fighting...   
   
**Medusa:**   
...   
   
**Medusa:**   
Yes, you may be right. The girl and I do have some sort of connection.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
The reason why you feel I should not fight is because you are concerned for her becoming a container for a Divine Spirit.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
...Hee. Being overprotective can sometimes backfire, Rider.   
   
**Medusa:**   
!!!   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Oh, but don't get me wrong.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I'm not quite sure why, but something within me compelled me to refer to you that way, by the name of your Class.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
But I have absolutely no memory of you. After all, I am Pārvatī right now. However...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Neither I, nor this body of mine, feel any anger towards you for what you've done here. In truth, we are happy about it.   
   
**Medusa:**   
So...you don't intend to stop the manifestation?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
No. This is a part of my duty.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I have been entrusted with a mission. I must deal with my own mess. Well, it's my own fault for making a certain sacrifice...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
No matter the path I take, I'm certain it will lead me to save the world as a goddess.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Even if it means I must sacrifice my life, I will protect the world and the people that I love.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
And the girl shared my wish to be such a being.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
It is the wish we share that allowed me to manifest here. At least that's what I believe.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Surely you must know that the girl possesses a strong heart.   
   
**Medusa:**   
Yes...you're right.   
   
**Medusa:**   
If your existence here is a result of her resolve...   
   
**Medusa:**   
All I did was get in her way and overstepped my boundaries in doing so.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
You didn't overstep anything. As I said, the thought behind your actions made us happy. Truly.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
But...there are things that even we cannot give up. That is all I wanted to say.   
   
**Medusa:**   
...Ah, you are absolutely right.   
   
**Medusa:**   
She may look weak and cowardly...but she really was strong-willed.   
   
**Medusa:**   
I had forgotten that you were that kind of person.   
   
**Medusa:**   
Please, allow me to apologize for my actions. And these clothes... Here, I will return them to their rightful owner.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Thank you very much. This is a relief.   
   
**Mash:**   
Looks like everything has been settled peacefully, Senpai.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yep, yep... Whoa, Par!?

**Pārvatī:**   
Oh, my... I'm a bit drained now that everything is over.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Now that I've recovered what I sought, this seems like a good place to take a rest.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Please rest assured. Now that we have met once and forged a bond...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
...so long as we retain that connection, we are sure to meet again, Fujimaru.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Yes. In due time, I am sure I will become your Servant. When that happens, I will work my hardest, so please take good care of me.   
   
**Medusa:**   
...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
It's okay, Rider. My shyness will never completely go away, but I've gotten tougher.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Even if the relationships between those in Chaldea are as complicated as that odd animal said...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
I'll be...well...I'm sure I'll be...fine.   
   
**Medusa:**   
...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Is something else bothering you? Oh, I get it.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
You've come to like this school uniform too, haven't you, Rider?   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Oh, all right. Even though this was originally mine...   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Those who have only seen you wearing this uniform might think a goddess assaulted you and stole your clothes.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
It might be best to consider making a duplicate of the uniform just for you.   
   
**Pārvatī:**   
Oh, it would be so wonderful for the two of us to wear matching uniforms and become Servants together!

**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um...  
  
---  
   
**Medusa:**   
I'm sorry, Master. This has turned into something of an anticlimactic farewell.   
   
**Medusa:**   
But that is another side of the girl...or so I feel. She can be a little ditzy...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
No worries. I have a feeling we'll meet again.  
  
---  
   
**Medusa:**   
...   
   
**Medusa:**   
Master. I know that, with you, there's no need to bring this up, but I will say it just the same.   
   
**Mash:**   
(Senpai, Senpai... Medusa's giving you a really terrifying glare, and she's not even using her Mystic Eyes!)   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Y-yes?  
  
---  
   
**Medusa:**   
Even if you do manage to summon her...   
   
**Medusa:**   
You must vow to not treat her like a disposable pawn or put her in unnecessarily dangerous situations.   
   
**Medusa:**   
I'm not asking for you to give her special treatment.   
   
**Medusa:**   
I'm only saying that you should treat her as well as the rest of your Servants, and take good care of her. Understood?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Understood.  
  
---  
   
**Medusa:**   
I can't hear you.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
YES, MA'AM!!!  
  
---  
   
**Medusa:**   
Good [♂ boy /♀ girl]. Now, let us head back.   
   
**Medusa:**   
Hm. I wonder why I'm feeling so restless.   
   
**Medusa:**   
Perhaps I should prepare by cleaning the room next to mine.   
   
**Mash:**   
Par is somewhat special, even unique among Pseudo-Servants...   
   
**Mash:**   
And not just to Medusa...   
   
**Mash:**   
But perhaps many others in Chaldea would feel the same way when they see her.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
That's concerning.  
   
**Mash:**   
It'll be okay. As long as Master's around, any complicated relationships between the Servants are sure to be resolved quickly!   
   
**Mash:**   
And of course, I will do my very best to support you!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's something to look forward to.  
   
**Mash:**   
That's the spirit, Master! I hope to one day have an outlook as positive as yours!   
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Either way, our quest here is done now. Good work!
