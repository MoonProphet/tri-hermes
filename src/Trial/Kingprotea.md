**Fujimaru 1:**   
Huh? Where am I...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Did I take a wrong turn somewhere...?  
   
  
---  
   
**A：???:**  
Mistakes were made. What were you thinking, leaving SE.RA.PH under these circumstances?   
   
**A：???:**  
Ever hear of curiosity killing the cat? Or did the sight of this deep-sea beauty make you go soft in the head?   
   
**A：???:**  
Not that either case says anything good about your intelligence! Now I've got to step in to help clean up your mess, stupid!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Do I know you...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Who are you again...?  
   
  
---  
   
**A：???:**  
Hmm. So, your perception is just as shot as I thought. You aren't able to reconcile what you're seeing now with your own memories, huh?   
   
**A：???:**  
Your mind and memories are both still sharp, but they're having trouble accessing what happened here.   
   
**A：???:**  
You're now essentially back to square one...a rookie Master who barely knows what [♂ he's /♀ she's] doing.   
   
**A：???:**  
Ah, well. I suppose I'll have to pull out all the stops to help your sorry ass!   
   
**A：???:**  
I'm H. C. A., the electronic fairy in charge of this trash compactor...the Cage of the Fallen, Klein Cube.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
You can think of me as an acquaintance of BB, since she's the one who summoned me, not Chaldea.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
An acquaintance of BB...?  
   
**H. C. A.:**  
That's right. We've only ever talked online, though.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
But I'm not a digital demon like her. I'm more like a Rogue Servant.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
I have plenty of time on my hands, and I only want to spend it working on my stories at your world's outskirts. I really don't have any desire to get involved with your world.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I'm sorry, what was your name again?  
   
**H. C. A.:**  
...I'm H. C. A., an electronic fairy. Ugh, it's kinda hard to actually say that without cringing.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
I know no one else is going to hear this, but still, it's really damn embarrassing.   
   
  
---  
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Anyway, let's start by breaking down where you are and what's going on here.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Right now, that building sinking to the bottom of the sea that looks like a bad joke... Sorry, Freudian slip.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
That building used to be an oil rig called Seraphix...but now, it's called SE.RA.PH, and none of the standard laws of physics apply to it.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
In SE.RA.PH, time doesn't flow in only one direction. Instead, it's something that can be measured in some interesting ways.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
And the spacing on the calipers used to measure it is nothing like your conception of physical space.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
That's probably because time and space are both measured from a one-dimensional perspective there.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Sometimes, you can even be in two different times while in the same space. This area we're in now is proof.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Here, neither BB nor SE.RA.PH can touch us. Why? Well, think of us as being a failed timeline.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Even though Seraphix is currently in the process of being reborn as SE.RA.PH, a purely digital structure...   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
...this place we're in now was produced as a sort of nonexistent space, even in the original SE.RA.PH.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
What for, you say? To get rid of anything unwanted, obviously.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Think of it as the oil rig equivalent of sweeping things under the rug.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Humans have always been good at ignoring things they'd rather not think about. It's one of their best defense mechanisms.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
This is rather like that, only more so. Like sweeping things under a rug, then destroying both it and the rug so thoroughly it is as if they never existed.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Now this place is beyond all things, outside thought and knowledge, a place where one cannot normally reach.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So...it's like the Trash Heap?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Does that mean it's like that one pitfall?  
   
  
---  
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Good! That's pretty much the right idea! This place is basically a hole, like a cave or a tree hollow!   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
That gravitational field continues on to a place absolutely no one knows about. It's almost like a trash can where the bottom is thousands of light-years away.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
However...while this cage was originally supposed to sink into the void forever...   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
...the one who recreated SE.RA.PH, unbelievable as it may be, seems to have also gone to the trouble of recreating its surrounding data.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
She knew about the danger involved, and went ahead with it anyway because she thought it seemed fun.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
This kind of reckless laziness is just like her. She wants everything she sees, but she can't even be bothered to get out of bed.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
I knew she had a cow's tits, but I didn't know she had a cow's brain too! Hell, maybe those horns of hers are actually something she was born with!   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Still, that alone wouldn't be too much of a problem. It's only now that another idiot's got [♂ himself /♀ herself] mixed up in all this that it's become such a mess.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Another idiot...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What idiot?  
   
  
---  
   
**H. C. A.:**  
You're the idiot! It's you!   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
What else would you call someone who just waltzes into a place they don't even need to be during an ultra time-sensitive emergency!?   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Now that you being here has accidentally proved this place exists, the proverbial gates of hell are about to be thrown wide open!   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
That gravitational field didn't even exist until you showed up. Same with the path that brought me here.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Oh well. I hate physical labor, but I love seeing idiots get what's coming to them.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Now listen up, Fujimaru. There's a Servant sleeping at the very bottom of this hole.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
A monster so awful that even BB threw her hands up pretending not to see it, and so dreadful even that lazy cow gave up on it.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
She's still sleeping right now, but it's only a matter of time until she starts looking for you in her dreams.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Now that you've opened this place up, you two have practically already locked eyes.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
If you leave here now, she'll sort of wander outside in her sleep, looking for you.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
And if that happens, it's game over. You and everyone on SE.RA.PH will be utterly obliterated.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Th-that's awful!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So, then...what should I do?  
   
  
---  
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Oh. Finally starting to understand how bad this is, are we? Good. Now is the time for action.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
You're the one who opened this hole, so you're the one who has to close it.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
And to do that, you need to defeat the monster who's been relegated to the bottom layer of the trash compactor.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Once she falls at your hand, she should remember that no one needs or wants her, and go back to sleep.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Okay. So I just have to get to the bottom, right?  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
By the way, what are you doing here?  
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Oh, that? I'm just the odd spirit out. SE.RA.PH might be summoning Heroic Spirits from throughout all of history...   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
...but it's also set up so that I can never get inside. Call it a mental block made tangible.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Who knows why she even bothers! I can only guess she must have something she really doesn't want me to see, though I couldn't even begin to guess what might be worth hiding at this point!   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
If she's gonna be that embarrassed about it, she could start by giving her mind a good, thorough scrubbing!   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Of course, she'd need to work AWFULLY hard to get all the dirt out! Hell, she could probably spend a lifetime in a washtub and it still wouldn't be enough!   
   
  
---  
   
**H. C. A.:**  
...Anyway, enough chatter. You've got a long way to go before you reach the bottom.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
The whole place is full of things that were tossed out for being too dangerous, just like her.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
You'll have to defeat all of them before you can reach the Cage of the Fallen.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Now go, Fujimaru! Whatever you accomplish here, it better be at least good enough for a special edition book's cover art!   
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
   
**H. C. A.:**  
...Good, you finally made it to the bottom. Now, before you go on, let me tell you a little story.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
This story took place on the Far Side of the Moon, a world entirely different from yours.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Back when BB was modifying herself over and over to help her corrode the Mooncell, she ended up creating five clones.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
These clones were High Servants, made by fusing the growing emotions she could no longer control with the essences of various goddesses.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
These Alter Egos came to be known collectively as the Sakura Five.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Meltryllis, the Alter Ego of pleasure. Passionlip, the Alter Ego of love and hatred.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
And Kingprotea, the Alter Ego of yearning, is the one being compressed right over there.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
She's a sentient life-form who will grow and expand to infinity if left unchecked, and can only exist digitally.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Left to her own devices, this walking disaster would consume SE.RA.PH and the Mooncell, eventually contaminating the ocean of stars.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Kingprotea...  
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Right. Don't let her current six-sided appearance deceive you.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
This entire gravitational field is being generated by Protea herself. If that cube opens up&ndash;   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
She doesn't look all that dangerous...  
   
**H. C. A.:**  
That's only because she's been reset to level one. She's practically a newborn right now.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
And even then, just look at all these gravitational fluctuations she's causing. If she were ever to get out into the physical world&ndash;   
   
  
---  
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Here she comes! She grows bigger with every passing second, so you can't let this fight drag on!   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Blast her with everything you've got right away! If you can hit her faster than she can grow, you'll win!   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Another option, though I don't recommend it, is to hold out for as long as possible! Even a monster like her has limits!   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
There should be a moment of vulnerability when she's transitioning to her next growth phase that you can take advantage of!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
The cube's cracking...!  
   
  
---  
   
**Kingprotea:**   
Love me... Love me... Please...love me...   
   
**Kingprotea:**   
I just want...someone to love me... But nobody...ever does...   
   
**Kingprotea:**   
Please...tell me why I was born... Please...help me quench my thirst...   
   
**Kingprotea:**   
I'm so hungry... No matter how much I have...it's never enough...   
   
**Kingprotea:**   
Oh... You're the one who found me...aren't you?   
   
**Kingprotea:**   
I love you. I love you. I love you. So please...   
   
**Kingprotea:**   
Please give yourself to me. Please allow me to live.   
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
   
**Kingprotea:**   
Ah...   
   
**Kingprotea:**   
So, this means...I'm going to disappear, doesn't it... Now I'll never...get to go outside...   
   
**Kingprotea:**   
Still...   
   
**Kingprotea:**   
At least...you came all this way... You weren't afraid of me...   
   
**Kingprotea:**   
I hate my mother, but...my memories of her...are warm...   
   
**Kingprotea:**   
All I wanted...was to touch someone... That's all I needed...to be fulfilled...   
   
**Kingprotea:**   
Even though our contact was barely enough to satisfy my curiosity...I'm still glad I got to touch you.   
   
**Kingprotea:**   
I'm so happy I met someone stronger than me.   
   
**Kingprotea:**   
Hehe... The universe really is a big place, isn't it. Maybe this means...   
   
**Kingprotea:**   
...I'll still get to be...a beautiful blushing bride...someda&ndash;   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...Did I really do the right thing...?  
   
  
---  
   
**H. C. A.:**  
About Kingprotea, you mean? It may not have been the happiest solution, but yes, it was the right one.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
That thing has no place in a digital world.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
In a world without physical limits, Protea has no way of escaping her own ego&ndash;her tṛ́ṣṇā.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Buddhism teaches that love is essentially a heart that never stops yearning.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
It is duṣkṛta, in which no matter how much you eat, how fulfilled you feel, or how much you grow...   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
...it will always leave you wanting more. Such longing is a black hole for the mind.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
No matter how much love you give it, it will never truly be full. And so long as it is not full, the heart can never hope to grow.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
That Alter Ego can never hope to find salvation as long as she's in SE.RA.PH.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
However, in a physical world, with firm laws and built-in limits, that's a different story.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
After all, once you've run out of food or can't grow anymore, that's proof that your cup runneth over.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
So if a certain Master with freakishly weird taste decided to try summoning that monster just for kicks...   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Who knows? [♂ He /♀ She] might just miraculously succeed at saving her without changing her monstrous nature.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Anyway, now that Kingprotea is gone, the gravitational fluctuations have followed suit. This little side story has officially come to an end, Fujimaru.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
It's time for you to get back to the main plot. Go laugh that ridiculous cyber city out of existence!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
...I'll do my best!  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Aren't you gonna help me, electronic fairy?  
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Didn't I already tell you? I don't do hard labor. I mean, just look at me. My claim to fame is writing fairy tales.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
I'd need to make the story a whole lot more exciting before I could show my face in the epilogue!   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
So I'll sit this one out and let you guys handle it. If I showed up now, I'd end up making the ending one big anticlimax.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Believe me, I have every confidence I'd take the wind out of that cow's sails with my sweet nothings!   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
That said, there's no way she'd be satisfied with only dying off once.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
She'd just come right back to life, and I'd have to destroy her all over again. It wouldn't actually resolve anything.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
No, the only kind of person who can really break her spirit is a fool like you, not a twisted guy like me.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Of course, if you try to face her directly, she'll probably just wipe you all out, but I'm sure you can figure a way around that if you put your mind to it.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
So once this is all wrapped up...make sure you tell the other version of me all about this someday. It'll give him a good laugh.   
   
**H. C. A.:**  
Consider that my reward for showing you the way here. Now go out there and win one for the fairy!
