# Trial Quest - Sherlock Holmes  
  
## A Discoverer, A Revealer, A Detectiveーーーor maybe An Arbitrator  
   
**Holmes:**   
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen.   
   
**Holmes:**   
I am Sherlock Holmes, world-renowned investigator, and the world's only consulting detective.   
   
**Holmes:**   
I am both the origin and a conglomeration of the very concept of a detective, and I represent all those who shine light on the truth.   
   
**Holmes:**   
I shall have the pleasure of leading you to new mysteries and new truths.   
   
**Holmes:**   
In consequence of a variety of very particular circumstances, I have manifested as a Servant and have, for the time being, taken up residence in Chaldea.   
   
**Holmes:**   
I cannot claim to be utilizing my detective skills to their utmost...but I am still myself, unchanged.   
   
**Holmes:**   
The only difference now is that rather than my accustomed seat in my room situated in 221B Baker Street, I presently find myself on Chaldea's multipurpose sofa.   
   
**Holmes:**   
...Or so I say.   
   
**Holmes:**   
I gather that for some of you, this is our first meeting, while there are others among you who have long been familiar with my history and skills.   
   
**Holmes:**   
If you are the former... Hmm, let's see...simply think of what you are about to witness as memories from the shadows of the future.   
   
**Holmes:**   
...or a dream, if you like. Though, lamentably, I am unable to intervene in dreams.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Which is to say: this is not a dream.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Now then. Let us begin.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Have you ever read the most excellent and famous detective mysteries that feature Sherlock Holmes as their main character?   
   
**Holmes:**   
Each features the detective solving various mysteries, set in the 19th and 20th centuries.   
   
**Holmes:**   
The stories are frequently adapted to film and other media. Surely you have at least heard of them.   
   
**Holmes:**   
...And so, seeing me manifest here as Holmes, one imagines you wondering:   
   
**Holmes:**   
“Was Sherlock Holmes an actual individual? Wasn't he a man of fiction?”   
   
**Holmes:**   
Indeed. Curious. Very curious.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Am I the manifestation of the character in the stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?   
   
**Holmes:**   
Or did the great detective Holmes really exist, and were the stories based on the events of his life?   
   
**Holmes:**   
...In other words, were the stories written by Sir Conan Doyle adapted from the biography by Watson?   
   
**Holmes:**   
This must be a great puzzle to you all as well. I had meant to bring this up one of these days.   
   
**Holmes:**   
This time around, the story is not about the Incineration of Humanity, nor its restoration.   
   
**Holmes:**   
The story is about yours truly.   
   
**Mash:**   
Good morning, Senpai. Did you get a good night's rest?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Morning, Mash.  
   
**Mash:**   
Yes, hello.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I rested well. Thanks.  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
It appears Mister Holmes has something to discuss with us this morning. Something about the battle simulator for training...   
   
**Holmes:**   
Good morning, Fujimaru. You have arrived at precisely the moment I anticipated.   
   
**Holmes:**   
As Miss Kyrielight mentioned, I would like you to accompany me to the simulator for an experiment.   
   
**Holmes:**   
The item I requested from Sir Babbage has finally been completed. I would like you to try it out.   
   
**Mash:**   
An item, you say?   
   
**Holmes:**   
An explanation would be a simple thing, but it would be far better to experience it.   
   
**Holmes:**   
It's not Rayshifting per se, so there's no need to be nervous. I would, however, advise you not to let your guard down.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Some battle is to be expected, of course. Let us begin.   
   
**Mash:**   
Um, excuse me, Mister Holmes! Senpai hasn't finished changing into the proper Mystic Code...!   
   
**Holmes:**   
Yes, I have already accounted for that and made the necessary adjustments. This is not a standard Rayshift, so it is easy enough for me to control such minor details.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Now, let us begin. Begin simulation!   
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai. Senpai, can you hear me?   
   
**Mash:**   
Good, we're connected. I'm glad. This feels more like a Rayshift than a simulation.   
   
**Mash:**   
So where...exactly is this place?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did the simulator always have a stage like this?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This seems familiar... Or maybe not so much...  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Well, it doesn't ring a bell to me.   
   
**Mash:**   
Normally, the simulator creates stages based on locations we've visited in Rayshifts.   
   
**Mash:**   
But, this is...wireframe...?   
   
**Holmes:**   
To use the parlance of science fiction, you might call it cyberspace. In that it is virtual reality, it's not much different from the simulator...   
   
**Holmes:**   
But behold! Thanks to the program that Sir Babbage created, we are inside Chaldea's computer system!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So in the end, it's cyberspace.  
   
**Mash:**   
Inside the computer system!? Does that mean you two are digitized?   
   
**Holmes:**   
Correct. Though, only our consciousnesses in this case. The technology necessary to digitize the physical body has still yet to be created.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
This place really does seem familiar...  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai?   
   
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Allow me to explain. The Simulator you normally use to train contained a curious mass of data within the mainframe's internal memory.   
   
**Holmes:**   
I lent my aid to the staff in an effort to remove it...   
   
**Holmes:**   
But it has given us quite a fight. And so, I requested the mathematical genius Sir Babbage to help us out.   
   
**Mash:**   
Um, wouldn't it have been easier for Babbage to work on it himself...?   
   
**Holmes:**   
I wanted to see for myself. Certain aspects of the venture tickled my fancy.   
   
**Holmes:**   
So I asked Sir Babbage to do the impossible task of creating a program to hack in.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I see?  
   
**Holmes:**   
Do you understand now?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So what's the point of me and Mash being here?  
   
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Ah, solving mysteries... While I certainly derive a certain satisfaction from solving them myself without anyone ever knowing...   
   
**Holmes:**   
I had the opportunity to invite you along and took it so that I might provide a bit of commentary while I went about solving this mystery.   
   
**Holmes:**   
And I simply could not do that were I alone, now, could I?   
   
**Mash:**   
So...because you wanted to comment on it... Well, it is true that when a great detective solves a mystery, an audience is an absolute necessity!   
   
**Mash:**   
We have front row seats to Mr. Holmes's commentary, Senpai!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Yay!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's cool and all, but it's REALLY early...  
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Indeed. And there is also the possibility of battle. I am not entirely certain that my new Spirit Origin can handle it alone.   
   
**Mash:**   
A new Spirit Origin?   
   
**Mash:**   
Mister Holmes...didn't you mention that you manifested as a Caster?   
   
**Holmes:**   
Well, you'll soon see.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Now then. Let's proceed, shall we? The node with the data mass in question is ahead.   
   
**Holmes:**   
I would have liked to appear immediately in front of the data mass, but the target node is well-protected.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Protection?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So it's the usual you-know-what...?  
  
---  
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
An all-too-familiar howl!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I knew it!  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Senpai, I'm detecting an enemy!   
   
**Mash:**   
...Huh? But you're inside Chaldea's mainframe...   
   
**Mash:**   
You're in a computer...and yet I’m detecting a response from an enemy that actually has magical energy!?   
   
**Holmes:**   
Ah, as expected.   
   
**Mash:**   
Mister Holmes!?   
   
**Holmes:**   
While we are indeed in the simulator, I should warn you that the battle we now face will be more real than a simulation.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Any injuries you sustain will likely affect your physical body in reality. Proceed with caution.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
We'll be fine.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Yep. Saw this coming.  
   
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Ah, that is certainly reassuring. Let us hold nothing back.   
   
**Mash:**   
...Target approaching rapidly! Please be careful, Senpai!   
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
   
**Mash:**   
Battle has ended. I'm not detecting any other enemies in your vicinity.   
   
**Mash:**   
Good work, Senpai. ...Senpai?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Holmes...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Bare-knuckle boxing?  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Now that you mention it...!   
   
**Mash:**   
Mister Holmes did use a special...facade in previous battles, saying there was an issue with his Spirit Origin.   
   
**Mash:**   
But this time...his appearance didn't change during battle!   
   
**Mash:**   
And he fought with his bare hands! Could that possibly be the famed, mysterious martial arts style...   
   
**Mash:**   
...that Mister Holmes utilized...taken directly from the stories of Sir Conan Doyle!?   
   
**Mash:**   
Baritsu!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Baritsu!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
What kind of martial art is that!?  
   
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
I haven't used Baritsu for a long time, but it is quite a thrill. Hm? What's the matter, Miss Kyrielight?   
   
**Holmes:**   
And with you, Master? As my Master, shouldn't Baritsu be familiar to you?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Um, I don't know Baritsu.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Wait, what? “Master”!?  
   
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Ah yes, I suppose I neglected to mention that.   
   
**Holmes:**   
I have officially become a Servant of Chaldea, and formed a contract with you. I did so last night.   
   
**Holmes:**   
We already had a connection, so it was only a matter of time... The rest... Well, a variety of circumstances and changes have taken place.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Wait a minute, your Class...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
I-is the label of Ruler a typo...?  
   
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Ah, yes. I mentioned I was a Caster. Forgive me. I lied.   
   
**Mash:**   
!!!   
   
**Mash:**   
A...lie...? M-Mister Holmes...that's...um...well...   
   
**Holmes:**   
A jest. My apologies. I couldn't help myself. Allow me to explain in all seriousness.   
   
**Holmes:**   
When I officially became a Servant of Chaldea, my Spirit Origin changed...significantly, much to my surprise, as I am sure you can imagine.   
   
**Holmes:**   
I was, most assuredly, a Caster before. But as of now, I am Sherlock Holmes, Ruler.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
You turned into a Ruler!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So that wasn't a typo!  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
Ruler, Sherlock Holmes!   
   
**Mash:**   
I see, so that's how it is!   
   
**Mash:**   
Since he is a great detective who has solved many difficult cases, it may indeed be appropriate to call Holmes a peacemaker or a mediator.   
   
**Mash:**   
No, I should not even say “may” in this case! I should say instead that this was very likely to happen!   
   
**Mash:**   
In the past, Jeanne, Martha, and Amakusa Shirou all told me the following:   
   
**Mash:**   
In the case of Heroic Spirit summoning based on the Holy Grail, only actual saints could be summoned as Rulers...   
   
**Mash:**   
But Chaldea's summoning system is not bound by such rules.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Curious. Very curious. A detective ought to seek the truth and lay it bare.   
   
**Holmes:**   
To make a ruling should be the job of a judge or a jury. My goodness...   
   
**--ARROW--:**  
   
**Mash:**   
By the way...there's something that's been bothering me...   
   
**Holmes:**   
What is it?   
   
**Mash:**   
The man who was Sherlock Holmes, the world's greatest detective and one and only consulting detective...   
   
**Mash:**   
May I ask a question? This has been on my mind for the longest time...   
   
**Mash:**   
Mister Sherlock Holmes, which exactly...are you?   
   
**Holmes:**   
By “which,” you mean...?   
   
**Mash:**   
Um...   
   
**Mash:**   
I believe you, Mister Holmes, know exactly what I am asking you.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Indeed. But as it happens, I would like you to say the words this time. Actually, it need not come from Miss Kyrielight herself...   
   
**Holmes:**   
Master. You have the same question in mind, correct?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Did you really exist, historically I mean?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Are you only a fictional character?  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
That's it! That was what I was curious about...   
   
**Mash:**   
At first, when I met you, all I could think was, “The great detective really did exist!” And I simply accepted that fact.   
   
**Mash:**   
Thinking about it, though... I'm not really sure. I've never heard the truth from you, Mister Holmes.   
   
**Mash:**   
On top of that, I recall you making contradictory statements about whether or not you are fictional...   
   
**Holmes:**   
Ah, I see.   
   
**Holmes:**   
I anticipated that this question would come up one day, and so I cannot say I am surprised. It is, after all, a perfectly reasonable question.   
   
**Holmes:**   
But Miss Kyrielight. Fujimaru.   
   
**Holmes:**   
If you do ask outright, things may grow more complicated. Would you mind that?   
   
**Mash:**   
Hm...?   
   
**Holmes:**   
Greek mythological heroes such as Heracles and the witch Medea... Karna and Arjuna from Indian mythology...   
   
**Holmes:**   
Celtic heroes, the knights from the Legend of King Arthur, Charlemagne's famous paladins, the giant-killing Beowulf...   
   
**Holmes:**   
The four retainers of Raikou who slayed the demon spider Tsuchigumo... Many myths and legends spoke of these heroes and great men and women...   
   
**Holmes:**   
Let us say for the moment that I am indeed a creation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. What, then, is to say that the individuals I mentioned are not similar creations?   
   
**Holmes:**   
I was created during the time when Doyle wrote his stories, but many heroes of legend were created by people writing stories long after their respective moments in time.   
   
**Holmes:**   
For example, Siegfried's story found in the Poetic Edda, while set in the 5th century, was not completed until after the 8th century.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Karna and Arjuna's story is set somewhere around 5000 B.C. The text itself, however, was completed sometime between the 4th century B.C. and the 4th century A.D.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Even the legend of Sakata Kintoki, Mister Golden himself, was said to be set down in narrative form sometime after the Edo period.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Other than him, the majority of the heroic tales of Japan's Heian period were passed on in stories told during the early days of the Edo period.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
So these heroes existed long ago...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Their legends were told long after they lived.  
   
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Ah, indeed. That is probably true. So what of me?   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Oh, I get it.  
   
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Ah, you understand now?   
   
**Holmes:**   
What difference is there between these heroes of legend and myself? None. We are essentially the same.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
But there isn't proof that you really existed...  
   
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Proof? Hm, I see. So you're saying that there's no physical evidence throughout human history that proves my existence...   
   
**Holmes:**   
There are indeed no official documents or records of my tenancy of 221B Baker Street.   
   
**Holmes:**   
...Or rather, records say there is no such place.   
   
**Mash:**   
Are you trying to say...that it actually exists?   
   
**Holmes:**   
That may simplify matters for me, but allow me to digress for a moment.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Consider the other heroes other than myself.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Hardly any heroes of myth have been proven to exist from the standpoints of cultural anthropology or archaeology. No remains have ever been found.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Even places said to be the burial sites of the heroes of legend have provided no proof.   
   
**Holmes:**   
One exception would be the Trojan War. Schliemann made the glorious, wonderful discovery that the Trojan War was actual historical fact.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Before his great discovery, the poems of the “Iliad” were believed to be no more than legend.   
   
**Holmes:**   
The same goes for the other heroes. Many of them are fictional&ndash;characters of legend.   
   
**Mash:**   
As such, many other Heroic Spirits also lack any definitive proof of their factual existence...   
   
**Holmes:**   
Indeed. To believe myself alone to be a fictitious being would be folly.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Legends and similarly unverified tales are no more than stories humans tell, correct?   
   
**Holmes:**   
The world is spherical, not flat. It is not carried upon the shoulders of the great titan Atlas, as Greek myth would have it.   
   
**Holmes:**   
The night is a result of the Earth's rotation, not of the goddess Nyx's cave.   
   
**Holmes:**   
There is no record of the evil dragon Fafnir existing in the 5th century, and even the Legend of King Arthur was woven by Sir Malory.   
   
**Holmes:**   
In other words, this world is...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I...see...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Hm? I feel like we got off track...?  
   
  
---  
   
**B：???:**  
Ugh! You talk too much!   
   
**???:**  
Oooooooooo010100001111...! 1011100101, I don't care if it's real or fictitious!!!   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Who said that!?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
That's one seriously digitized shout!  
   
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
I suppose it's time. In the midst of all that prattling, we've reached our destination.   
   
**Mash:**   
The unidentified data mass...! So that voice we heard&ndash;   
   
**Holmes:**   
Well, it is not unidentified.   
   
**Mash:**   
Eh? Um, but...   
   
**Holmes:**   
I can see why you might believe that. But think back...   
   
**Holmes:**   
Allow me to explain. The simulator you normally use to train contained a curious mass of data within the mainframe's internal memory.   
   
**Holmes:**   
I lent my aid to the staff in an effort to remove it...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Ah!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
He didn't say “unidentified!”  
   
  
---  
   
**Mash:**   
A curious data mass... E-excuse me... I just said “unidentified” because what you said made me assume...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Holmes should have worded it better.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Holmes...you malicious man.  
   
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Haha, my apologies. It's true. There's no need for Miss Kyrielight to regret her words.   
   
**Holmes:**   
It was easier to guide you all here by inferring that we were going to investigate an unknown entity.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Of course, I have already deduced the identity of the data mass, and now that we are closer, my belief is becoming a growing conviction.   
   
**Holmes:**   
In other words...   
   
**Holmes:**   
It is excess data that has been piling up in the memory of the battle simulator's mainframe.   
   
**Holmes:**   
It is generated every time Fujimaru wins.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Normally it would be deleted every time training ends, but it appears some fragments have remained in the registry.   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
Excess data...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Generates every time we win?  
   
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Yes. It's anger that is generated every time NPCs lose a battle.   
   
**Mash:**   
Anger...?   
   
**Mash:**   
NPCs...the enemy sprites we fight in simulation battles?   
   
**Holmes:**   
As they were created to simulate the enemies found in the Singularities, the NPCs are very aggressive.   
   
**Holmes:**   
NPCs are obviously not artificial beings. That is to say that they have neither emotions nor personality. Yet, they still have some measure of intellect.   
   
**Holmes:**   
At least where matters of battle are concerned. They are equipped with AI so that they can think in battle.   
   
**Holmes:**   
They are created expressly for you to battle.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Werewolf, Goblin, Wyvern, Hermit Crab, Demonic Boar...   
   
**Holmes:**   
And a variety of Shadow Servants have also been created. It appears that these numerous NPCs felt anger each time they lost.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Their anger...secretly building up all this time.

**Fujimaru 1:**   
That seems to be contradictory.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
...Anger? But they don't have emotion, right?  
   
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Precisely. “Anger” is not exactly the right word, and it should not even be possible in the first place.   
   
**Holmes:**   
They were programmed to win, and yet could not... NPCs should only be capable of acknowledgement of that fact.   
   
**Holmes:**   
But someone twisted that acknowledgement into the emotion of anger. And that is our culprit.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Well, I will personally deal with the culprit later on...   
   
**Holmes:**   
For the time being, we must pacify the NPCs our culprit has driven berserk in order to keep the simulator operating smoothly.   
   
**Mash:**   
(W-wow, Holmes is amazing! He's talking like this case is already closed!)   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
I wonder who the true culprit is...?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
Okay, first let's quell their anger!  
   
  
---  
   
**???:**  
Ooooooooo0101010101...!!!   
   
**???:**  
Getting defeated continuously within the data sphere...regret!!! I'll make sure nobody will be able to use the battle simulator ever again!   
   
**???:**  
Using us for every little thing...! Die, Chaldea! Die, Servants! Die, Master!!!   
   
**???:**  
We will never drop Ascension materials for you again! EVER! Why would real materials drop in a simulator, anyway!?   
   
**???:**  
To hell with Embers! To hell with Secret Gems!   
   
**???:**  
Ooooooooo0100111100110101! Die! Die! Die and become excess data, too!!!   
   
**Mash:**   
Magical energy response is increasing, Senpai! Prepare for battle!   
   
**Holmes:**   
I shall leave the commands in this battle to you, Master. By the way, the Mystic Code best compatible with me would be&ndash;   
   
**Mash:**   
Enemy response approaching... They're coming!   
   
**Holmes:**   
Egad!   
   
**--BATTLE--:**  
   
**Mash:**   
Battle has ended. I am not detecting any traces of magical energy around you anymore, either.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Good work, Fujimaru. The case is closed for now.   
   
**Holmes:**   
This shouldn't damage the simulator's operation, and the NPCs should no longer harbor anger.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Never forget, Master: those beings battle you endlessly, day and night, so you might train and grow.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Though they will no longer possess anger or feelings of regret...   
   
**Holmes:**   
Even if they are no more than data with neither personality nor life... They are in a sense members of Chaldea who helped in your fight to save humanity.   
   
**Holmes:**   
It may be best to keep that in the back of your mind whenever you go through a Battle Simulation.   
   
**Mash:**   
Mister Holmes...   
   
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**   
He sure summed that up pretty nicely...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**   
So, what exactly are you, Holmes?  
   
  
---  
   
**Holmes:**   
Hahahaha.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Returning to that topic would once more open up a can of worms. If that is all right...   
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
...I see you've glossed over it all.   
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Child of Hydra, dragon's skin and fang, talons of the Tsuchigumo spider of the East, relics and Noble Phantasms left from the Age of Gods...   
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Even behind the shadows of society, if we speak of the realm of magecraft, there should be plenty of “proof” you can present.   
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Historical? Fictional? Why on earth would you be mentioning this now?   
   
**Holmes:**   
I had no choice. If we had dug deeper, we would need to discuss matters such as parallel worlds or the Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon, and I would even need to go into detail about the Age of Gods.   
   
**Holmes:**   
We live in a world where the distant past retains no physical trace of us... That is the manner of uncertainty in which we live.   
   
**Holmes:**   
It is as it should be, since what we can see and touch and experience as reality are brief, fleeting events.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Even secured by the Sacred Lance, such a thing could easily be stripped away if the means were discovered.   
   
**Holmes:**   
There's no need for humans to know. They shouldn't know.   
   
**Holmes:**   
That is why I was given the Spirit Origin of a Ruler...as a mediator and judge.   
   
**Holmes:**   
I mediate the truth and rule over all creation to maintain the history of humanity.   
   
**Holmes:**   
As one who shines a light on the truth, I sense that the world is telling me that not all illusions and dreams should be laid bare.   
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
That's utter sophistry. You could very well have avoided any or all of those topics while explaining, great detective that you are.   
   
**Holmes:**   
It's quite vexing to hear you flatter me. Do stop that at once.   
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Hahaha! Your words cut deep!   
   
**Holmes:**   
And well they should.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Ah, one more thing: That tampering with the battle simulator was your doing, yes?   
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Mmm? Whatever are you talking about?   
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
I confess I was interested in the device, from a mathematical standpoint, you see. And I did take a look at the system itself. No more than that, though.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Let's have your story, then. I noticed an inexplicable burst of static lasting only a few seconds during Chaldea's log this past May.   
   
**Holmes:**   
Even I could not determine quite what it was. It must have been a special case indeed.   
   
**Holmes:**   
I have at least a notion of what manner of phenomenon it was. You must have used THAT static blocker as a reference.   
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
If you knew from the beginning, then I'd appreciate you refrain from even asking! Honestly, you've always been such a pernicious detective!   
   
**Holmes:**   
Oh? Has there ever been any instance where I showed my wicked side to you within Sir Doyle's works?   
   
**Archer of Shinjuku:**   
Wh-why, you...!
